the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed about the discussions , " government spokesman thomas steg said monday , referring to the 300 million euros -lrb- $ 411 million -rrb- worth of milan-type anti-tank missile and communications systems that libya has ordered from the jointly owned french-german european aeronautic space and defense company -lrb- eads -rrb- . although eads is partly owned by german auto giant daimlerchrysler and components of the milan-type missiles are produced in germany by eads subsidiary mbda , the government sees no need for negotiation , added steg . he referenced a 1972 german-french treaty stating that the explicit approval of the other was not necessary in matters of armament exports by joint enterprises . " france 's armament export policy does n't contradict the spirit of german-french cooperation , " said the spokesman . steg also denied suspicions that the libyan arms deal was linked to the recent release of six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to death for deliberately infecting 400 children with the hiv virus . criticism from coalition leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian medics returned to sofia with a pardon on july 24 in an interview published in monday 's edition of german daily handelsblatt , walter kolbow , chairmen of coalition partner the social democratic party , was sceptical of the missile deal . he suggested that the government examine the deal more in depth before tacitly approving , implying that it may indeed have had something to do with the release of the medics .
french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied any connection between the two agreements . it is with good reason that the european union has maintained a lukewarm policy toward libya since the end of the arms embargo three years ago , said kolbow . the eads deal is the first arms agreement libya has made with a european country since 2004 . article based on news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed about the discussions , " government spokesman thomas steg said monday , referring to the 300 million euros -lrb- $ 411 million -rrb- worth of milan-type anti-tank missile and communications systems that libya has ordered from the jointly owned french-german european aeronautic space and defense company -lrb- eads -rrb- . although eads is partly owned by german auto giant daimlerchrysler and components of the milan-type missiles are produced in germany by eads subsidiary mbda , the government sees no need for negotiation , added steg . he referenced a 1972 german-french treaty stating that the explicit approval of the other was not necessary in matters of armament exports by joint enterprises . " france 's armament export policy does n't contradict the spirit of german-french cooperation , " said the spokesman . steg also denied suspicions that the libyan arms deal was linked to the recent release of six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to death for deliberately infecting 400 children with the hiv virus . criticism from coalition leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian medics returned to sofia with a pardon on july 24 in an interview published in monday 's edition of german daily handelsblatt , walter kolbow , chairmen of coalition partner the social democratic party , was sceptical of the missile deal . he suggested that the government examine the deal more in depth before tacitly approving , implying that it may indeed have had something to do with the release of the medics .
french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied any connection between the two agreements . it is with good reason that the european union has maintained a lukewarm policy toward libya since the end of the arms embargo three years ago , said kolbow . the eads deal is the first arms agreement libya has made with a european country since 2004 . article based on news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed about the discussions , " government spokesman thomas steg said monday , referring to the 300 million euros -lrb- $ 411 million -rrb- worth of milan-type anti-tank missile and communications systems that libya has ordered from the jointly owned french-german european aeronautic space and defense company -lrb- eads -rrb- . although eads is partly owned by german auto giant daimlerchrysler and components of the milan-type missiles are produced in germany by eads subsidiary mbda , the government sees no need for negotiation , added steg . he referenced a 1972 german-french treaty stating that the explicit approval of the other was not necessary in matters of armament exports by joint enterprises . " france 's armament export policy does n't contradict the spirit of german-french cooperation , " said the spokesman . steg also denied suspicions that the libyan arms deal was linked to the recent release of six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to death for deliberately infecting 400 children with the hiv virus . criticism from coalition leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian medics returned to sofia with a pardon on july 24 in an interview published in monday 's edition of german daily handelsblatt , walter kolbow , chairmen of coalition partner the social democratic party , was sceptical of the missile deal . he suggested that the government examine the deal more in depth before tacitly approving , implying that it may indeed have had something to do with the release of the medics .
french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied any connection between the two agreements . it is with good reason that the european union has maintained a lukewarm policy toward libya since the end of the arms embargo three years ago , said kolbow . the eads deal is the first arms agreement libya has made with a european country since 2004 . article based on news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .

" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .

" i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 07.08.2007 berlin struggles to save crumbling remnants of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east side gallery needs a fresh coat of renovation berlin 's east side gallery , painted on one of the last remaining remnants of the city 's infamous wall , needs a revamp if it is to survive .
but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art .

i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art .

bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .

it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .

that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .

any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?

we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .

there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .

it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .

is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .

the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .

a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed about the discussions , " government spokesman thomas steg said monday , referring to the 300 million euros -lrb- $ 411 million -rrb- worth of milan-type anti-tank missile and communications systems that libya has ordered from the jointly owned french-german european aeronautic space and defense company -lrb- eads -rrb- . although eads is partly owned by german auto giant daimlerchrysler and components of the milan-type missiles are produced in germany by eads subsidiary mbda , the government sees no need for negotiation , added steg . he referenced a 1972 german-french treaty stating that the explicit approval of the other was not necessary in matters of armament exports by joint enterprises . " france 's armament export policy does n't contradict the spirit of german-french cooperation , " said the spokesman . steg also denied suspicions that the libyan arms deal was linked to the recent release of six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to death for deliberately infecting 400 children with the hiv virus . criticism from coalition leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian medics returned to sofia with a pardon on july 24 in an interview published in monday 's edition of german daily handelsblatt , walter kolbow , chairmen of coalition partner the social democratic party , was sceptical of the missile deal . he suggested that the government examine the deal more in depth before tacitly approving , implying that it may indeed have had something to do with the release of the medics .
french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied any connection between the two agreements . it is with good reason that the european union has maintained a lukewarm policy toward libya since the end of the arms embargo three years ago , said kolbow . the eads deal is the first arms agreement libya has made with a european country since 2004 . article based on news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain .

" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse .

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .

it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 07.08.2007 german firms bracing for steep losses if rail strike goes ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that a rail strike could even put a dent in germany 's economic recovery german industry says it stands to lose millions of euros if a planned strike by a german train drivers ' union goes ahead , causing mass disruptions to passenger and freight traffic throughout the country . after weeks of wrangling over a pay dispute , the german train drivers ' union -lrb- gdl -rrb- and germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn on tuesday agreed to allow mediation to solve the long-running conflict , raising hope that a planned strike that could cause widespread economic damage may yet be averted . manfred schell , head of the gdl union , said he was prepared to accept an outside negotiator suggested by the federal government to iron out the row . but the planned strikes , he said , will go ahead .
the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse .

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed about the discussions , " government spokesman thomas steg said monday , referring to the 300 million euros -lrb- $ 411 million -rrb- worth of milan-type anti-tank missile and communications systems that libya has ordered from the jointly owned french-german european aeronautic space and defense company -lrb- eads -rrb- . although eads is partly owned by german auto giant daimlerchrysler and components of the milan-type missiles are produced in germany by eads subsidiary mbda , the government sees no need for negotiation , added steg . he referenced a 1972 german-french treaty stating that the explicit approval of the other was not necessary in matters of armament exports by joint enterprises . " france 's armament export policy does n't contradict the spirit of german-french cooperation , " said the spokesman . steg also denied suspicions that the libyan arms deal was linked to the recent release of six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to death for deliberately infecting 400 children with the hiv virus . criticism from coalition leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian medics returned to sofia with a pardon on july 24 in an interview published in monday 's edition of german daily handelsblatt , walter kolbow , chairmen of coalition partner the social democratic party , was sceptical of the missile deal . he suggested that the government examine the deal more in depth before tacitly approving , implying that it may indeed have had something to do with the release of the medics .
french president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly denied any connection between the two agreements . it is with good reason that the european union has maintained a lukewarm policy toward libya since the end of the arms embargo three years ago , said kolbow . the eads deal is the first arms agreement libya has made with a european country since 2004 . article based on news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

they will be asked to testify whether a certain type of truck existed in the camp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 07.08.2007 berlin struggles to save crumbling remnants of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east side gallery needs a fresh coat of renovation berlin 's east side gallery , painted on one of the last remaining remnants of the city 's infamous wall , needs a revamp if it is to survive .
but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .

some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .

it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .

the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "

that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .

a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2007 stuttgart 's roberto hilbert : a rising star of german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has been making some serious noise lately roberto hilbert played a crucial role in stuttgart 's bundesliga title and was voted the league 's best winger of last season .
the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 07.08.2007 germany knew of libya arms deal , says spokesman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy have talked at length about eads , but not about the deal with libya a government spokesman has said germany sees no need to have a say in the planned controversial arms deal between libya and european aerospace giant eads jointly owned by france and germany .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes .

that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "

that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .

any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .
" of course , the traffic volume by rail for the steel industry is enormous , and therefore disturbances have important effects , " said wolfgang leese , chairman of salzgitter , one of europe 's leading steel and technology companies .
90 percent of the company 's product travels over the rail system . agreements reached with other train unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn gets a red light from its train drivers gdl chief manfred schell said he would be prepared to call off the strike if a " reasonable offer " was placed on the table .
any deal for the drivers would have to be separate from agreements made last month with other rail staff , schell said . last month , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase .
the salary hike will be spread over 19 months starting in january 2008 and will include a bonus of 600 euros . the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . deutsche bahn human resources director , margret suckale , suggested appointing an independent mediator , which has been a sticking point between the two sides . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on tuesday appealed to both sides to return to the negotiating table .
tiefensee added that the government would not become " involved directly in the conflict " in line with long-standing policy in germany , but urged both sides to remember their responsibilities to rail users and to the general economy . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.08.2007 german minister worried about copy-cat afghan kidnappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if some taliban are arrested , others are bound to copy their crimes as the government fights for the life of a german hostage in afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler expresses the fear in a deutsche welle interview that the current debates could encourage copy-cat criminals . deutsche welle : what is the current situation regarding the efforts to release the german hostage in afghanistan ? gernot erler : unfortunately i ca n't give you any good news : the efforts of the emergency task force in cooperation with the afghan authorities continue .
we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffiti covers much of the original art work although flähmig is confident that enough public money can be found to finance the project , alavi is backing more than one horse . " this renovation was supposed to start in april , then it was put back to august .
now it is august and they 're still negotiating .
if they push it back any further , we will have to try and get private sponsors on board , " alavi said .
he 's been down that road before , and is not afraid to travel it again . tried and tested seven years ago , 333 meters of the gallery were successfully renovated after alavi and his artists ' initiative looked for funding outside the public domain . " the last time we talked to private sponsors , we had raised half a million euros within two months , " alavi said . the fact that he now needs four times that amount is not dissuading alavi who believes time is of the essence .
bildunterschrift : the israeli flag over the german flag " we have always said we are prepared to start at a moment 's notice and we could finish all the paintings within two months , but the longer we leave it , the more problems we are likely to encounter , " he said .
" people move around a lot and we lose track of them .
four of the artists have already died and others are getting too old . " the problem , as alavi sees it , is that the authorities are dragging their feet .
even if he were to try and raise the necessary money from private sponsors , he would still need the authorities to grant their official permission - something they have not yet definitively done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life on the spree beyond the wall his fear is that the planning powers that be are more interested in potential building projects on the empty land right across the street from the world 's longest open air gallery as they are in the gallery itself . hole in the wall following the city planning office decision to remove a 48-meter section of the gallery wall as part of a massive arena construction project on the far side of the road , alavi believes he has good reason to be concerned . " i wonder if the reason for all this stalling on the part of the authorities is that other investors are planning to build and they are looking to cut more holes into the wall . " but flähmig , who sees the gallery as an important berlin tourist attraction , says no such plans are in the immediate offing . " much of the land on both sides of the new arena is public and will be turned into parks , " he said , before adding that " there are some private plots which have planning permission and which might to create need emergency escape routes . "
that being the case , flähmig stresses that the authorities would find a solution .
bildunterschrift : a hole in the wall any solution which means creating another hole in the 1.3-kilometer stretch of authentic gdr history , would meet with resistance from the likes of alavi and his fellow artists , who , besides maintaining the existing gallery , are keen to establish a documentation centre which would retell the most recent chapter in german history through art . " we want to use this mixture of history and art to break down the walls in people 's heads , " alavi said , " we want to prevent anyone else from coming along and doing the same thing again .

but the project remains mired in funding woes and red tape . nobody was thinking about the long-term future of the east side gallery when it took shape during the euphoric aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall . some 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to berlin to use the wall as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the east german communist regime which erected it back in 1961 . the result - a long 1.3-kilometer -lrb- 0.80 miles -rrb- stretch of gaily-colored berlin wall situated alongside the river spree and near the ostbahnhof railway station - is an automatic must-see for tourists to the german capital . bildunterschrift : the gallery is in bad shape over the years , wind , water and carbon dioxide emissions - as well as occasional acts of vandalism - have steadily and fiercely eroded the gallery 's substance . and renovating it is far from easy . it is not a question of simply taking down the paintings and preserving them while the walls on which they hang are restored .
on the contrary , in order to get to the wall to restore it at all , the paintings have to be entirely destroyed .
they would subsequently be repainted by the same artists who are waiting in the wings for their cue . a fair price ? the total cost of the renovation project is estimated at more than 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.13 million -rrb- .
some berliners are already hot under the collar at the thought of taxpayers ' money being spent on repainting this most prolific relic of the gdr , and a recent survey conducted by berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper suggested only 27 percent of berliners are in favor of the renovation . but kani alavi , co-founder and president of the artists ' initiative east side gallery says it 's a small price to pay for the upkeep of a crucial part of the city 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gallery 's most ubiquitious image gallery - fellow communists erich honecker and leonid brezhnev kissing " the gallery serves as a document , " he said , " and we and the city authorities have to be prepared to protect the history of berlin . " thus far , the authorities have agreed to stump up the money to pay for the technical restoration of the actual wall but not the repainting thereof .
jörg flähmig , who works for the city 's planning authorities says the renovation work can not and will not commence until the project has been financed in its entirety . " we are still trying to secure the money for the repainting , but we 're not yet sure where it will come from .
we 're currently still trying to ascertain which funding pot we can tap into to cover the costs . "

we hope for a positive conclusion soon . you said in another interview that the contact to the hostage-takers was indirect .
what does that mean ? it 's been public knowledge for some time that the direct contact is being cultivated above all by the afghan government .
in recent weeks , people have gotten the impression that the german government has abandoned its stance .
to what extent is that the case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai : the afghans have direct contact to kidnappers it is rather a reaction to the taliban 's approach .
we are increasingly seeing that attempts are being made here to influence the discussion in western countries through disinformation campaigns , in germany , too , in relation to the afghanistan mission .
we had to respond to that .
we have to correct false reports for example .
is there a debate within the federal government about how to deal with the kidnappings ?
there is no difference between the chancellery 's and the foreign ministry 's outlooks regarding approach .
the confusion emerged because the foreign ministry and the foreign minister had to respond to the disinformation attempts that came from the taliban . is there a debate within the governing coalition about how one should in general deal with the kidnappings and ransom demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler this public debate can not be averted .
it crops up , but it ca n't bring us any further .
every sort of explanation , as is usually given , potentially brings copy-cat criminals to life .
that 's why it 's clear that we have to stick with a case-by-case treatment here .
that 's why the federal government is also not getting involved in this public debate about ransom payments . foreign minister steinmeier said he could imagine extending the deployment in afghanistan .
is that also a reaction to the hostage-taking in afghanistan ? i think it 's important that there 's a change in the orientation of our public discussion .
away from the question of what may possibly have the basis for a consensus in the german bundestag to the question : how can one make the western world 's mission in afghanistan a genuine success ?
there were several worrying developments here over the last two years .
in this context , one always returns to the conclusion that there 's a backlog demand when it comes to training the afghan army , but also the police .
the eu already responded with its new police-training mission in afghanistan .
we 're now considering whether , within the framework of what is doable , we can do more toward training the afghan army .
that is truly a contribution toward making the situation better on the ground , without any tactical ulterior motives . extending the mission does n't necessarily mean deploying more battle troops , but it does at least mean more german soldiers or police will be in afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans train the afghan army and police to start with , the issue is expanding the mandate .
whether that will have to involve a change to the upper limit - that still has to be examined .
it 's also conceivable that with a different division of tasks we can do more for training the afghan army within the realm of the current upper limit , but for that , conclusive examinations must be completed .
the debate was intense about whether german troops should also be deployed to the afghanistan 's volatile south .
now one gets the sense from certain comments that it is at least conceivable . it 's at least conceivable that in resolving the question of how training can truly be noticeably improved such geographical restrictions may have to be deemed less important than they have been so far .
but that , too , is still speculative , since details must first be resolved as to the how the training can be most effectively strengthened .

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .

the gdl had planned a four-hour work stoppage on thursday on cargo trains . deutsche bahn has warned that the strike would also cause massive disruptions to rail passenger traffic .
relying on the rails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are expected the possibility of a strike has caused great concern among german companies who rely on rail to transport their goods to market . these industries would be set to lose 100 million euros -lrb- $ 137 million -rrb- if the strike goes forward , according to estimates by the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw . -rrb-
it 's unlikely that the striking conductors would allow other traffic to go around them , said arthur-iren martini , the head of network private railways .
the association represents private rail freight companies from several european countries .
the railway " is like a water pipeline , " martini told the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper .
" if you insert a barrier somewhere , the whole system stops . "
a strike could threaten the existence of some private companies , if they ca n't find another way to get goods to market .
" when our train conductors ca n't drive , we do n't get any income , " martini said .
some sectors would be harder hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight trains also wo n't be going anywhere the steel industry , car manufacturers and bulk chemical companies would be the worst affected , experts said .
that 's because those important industries have fewer transportation alternatives .
food transportation would be less disrupted since produce can easily go by truck .
a spokesman for volkswagen , which has 11 factories in germany , said it was " taking the strike more than seriously . " volkswagen was setting up a " crisis unit " to consider alternative ways to transport its cars and warned it could lose millions of euros .
bmw said it was seeking additional capacity from road haulage firms to transport its cars .
some 55 per cent of the 3,500 cars made a day by the company in germany were normally carried by rail , a spokesman said .
" a goods train can take 200 cars , and a truck just eight , " he noted .
the steel industry is also worried .

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 22-year-old talked to dw about his mercurial rise and his goals for the future . if there were any questions remaining about roberto hilbert 's importance to his team , they were settled on saturday during stuttgart 's narrow 2-1 win over wehen wiesbaden in the first round of the german cup . hilbert saved the reigning bundesliga champions from embarrassment by stepping up and converting not one , but two penalties . normally such responsibility would be reserved for more experienced players , but stuttgart has every reason to be confident in hilbert 's nerves and leadership qualities . in 2006-7 , hilbert played in every game for the southern german side and scored four crucial goals during the 8-game winning streak that secured stuttgart the league title . domestic responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert has gone from the fourth division to the national squad hilbert 's early maturity may something to do with having a child at a young age . " perhaps that 's true , " hilbert told dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off .
" i became a father early on .
i have a lot of responsibility at home , and i enjoy taking on responsibility together with my wife .
i know where i come from , and i keep my feet on the ground . " hilbert rise is the product of hard work .
in 2003 , while peers bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski were already being touted as the bundesliga 's next stars , hilbert was honing his talents in the fourth division . now he 's become a mainstay with the league champions , while schweini and poldi are struggling to stay in bayern 's starting 11 . winning quietly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilbert got to celebrate a title after his first season in the first division hilbert is fleet of foot , difficult to separate from the ball and not shy about testing keepers from long distance .
those qualities earned him his first national caps earlier this year , and he could play a major role for germany in the 2008 european championship . but first he 'll be trying to repeat last season 's success with stuttgart .
many experts do n't give the champions must chance of repeating , but hilbert thinks that could be an advantage . " we 'll stay modest , " hilbert said .
" the media like to talk about bayern , bremen and schalke , and that 's good for us .
let them talk about the supposed big three .
they can do that every season , as far as i 'm concerned , as long as the end result is the same as last year . " if hilbert continues to improve at the pace he has set in the past few seasons , the results would be very positive indeed . you can watch the entire interview with roberto hilbert on this week 's edition of bundesliga kick-off . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french researchers compared women aged 65 and older who drank more than three cups of coffee per day with those who drank one cup or less per day .
those who drank more caffeine showed less decline in memory tests over a four year period .
the study , published in the journal neurology , raises the possibility that caffeine may even protect against the development of dementia . "
it might be that caffeine could slow the dementia process " dr karen ritchie french national institute for health and medical research the results held up even after factors such as education , high blood pressure and disease were taken into account .
caffeine is a known psychostimulant , but this study appears to suggest its effects may be more profound .
however , lead researcher dr karen ritchie of the french national institute for health and medical research warned against jumping to premature conclusions .
she said : " while we have some ideas as to how this works biologically , we need to have a better understanding of how caffeine affects the brain before we can start promoting caffeine intake as a way to reduce cognitive decline .
" but the results are interesting - caffeine use is already widespread and it has fewer side effects than other treatments for cognitive decline , and it requires a relatively small amount for a beneficial effect . "
the study , which involved 7,000 women , did not find that caffeine consumers had lower rates of dementia .
women ' more sensitive ' dr ritchie said : " we really need a longer study to look at whether caffeine prevents dementia ; it might be that caffeine could slow the dementia process rather than preventing it . "
she said it was not clear why the protective effect did not seem to apply to men .
" women may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine .
their bodies may react differently to the stimulant , or they may metabolize caffeine differently . "
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , said that with no cure for alzheimer 's disease yet available , research into possible protective factors was important , particularly as the disease is expected to become more common .
she said : " this study does not suggest that caffeine actually lowers rates of dementia in women , but since memory seems improved , it may be that it is slowing it down .
" however , research over a much longer period is still needed to establish fully what the affects of caffeine are in both men and women and whether it could reduce a person 's risk of dementia or slow down its progress . "
dr susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said drinking coffee and tea had both been tipped as possible ways of delaying the onset of dementia .
however , she said : " these types of studies are complex because coffee and tea drinking can be linked to so many other social and life style factors . "

their bodies may react differently to the stimulant , or they may metabolize caffeine differently . "
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , said that with no cure for alzheimer 's disease yet available , research into possible protective factors was important , particularly as the disease is expected to become more common .
she said : " this study does not suggest that caffeine actually lowers rates of dementia in women , but since memory seems improved , it may be that it is slowing it down .
" however , research over a much longer period is still needed to establish fully what the affects of caffeine are in both men and women and whether it could reduce a person 's risk of dementia or slow down its progress . "
dr susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said drinking coffee and tea had both been tipped as possible ways of delaying the onset of dementia .
however , she said : " these types of studies are complex because coffee and tea drinking can be linked to so many other social and life style factors . "

french researchers compared women aged 65 and older who drank more than three cups of coffee per day with those who drank one cup or less per day .

however , lead researcher dr karen ritchie of the french national institute for health and medical research warned against jumping to premature conclusions .
she said : " while we have some ideas as to how this works biologically , we need to have a better understanding of how caffeine affects the brain before we can start promoting caffeine intake as a way to reduce cognitive decline .
" but the results are interesting - caffeine use is already widespread and it has fewer side effects than other treatments for cognitive decline , and it requires a relatively small amount for a beneficial effect . "
the study , which involved 7,000 women , did not find that caffeine consumers had lower rates of dementia .

a study by edinburgh university has shown that one in 230 pet cats in the uk is now diabetic .
overweight cats are said to be more than three times as likely to suffer from diabetes , which develops when the body has problems making insulin .
neutered males that do not get adequate exercise are particularly at risk .
to reduce your cat 's risk of developing this often fatal disease you need to keep them active , and not allow them to gain too much weight professor danielle gunn-moore edinburgh university cat lovers have been warned to crack down on treats for their pets if they are to avoid the risk of them developing the potentially fatal condition .
professor danielle gunn-moore , from edinburgh university 's royal -lrb- dick -rrb- school of veterinary studies , said : " this is the first study of its kind to try to quantify diabetes among cats in the uk and the results show extremely worrying levels .
" to reduce your cat 's risk of developing this often fatal disease you need to keep them active , and not allow them to gain too much weight . "
insulin is a hormone that helps cells use glucose from starchy and sweet foods for energy .
the condition has topped overactive thyroid disease as the most common hormone problem in cats .
the number of diabetic cats is almost five times higher than a previous study carried out in the us in the 1970s .

more than two million people in the uk have the condition .
prof gunn-moore said : " the lifestyle of cats , just like their owners , is changing .
" they are tending to eat too much , gain weight , and take less exercise .
" unfortunately , just like people , cats will overeat if they are offered too much tasty food , particularly if they are bored and have little else to do .
" while cats would naturally exercise outside , many cats are now housebound - perhaps because they live in a flat or because their owners feel that it is too dangerous to let them out - so they have little to do all day but eat , sleep , and gain weight . "
the research , published in the journal of feline medicine and surgery , was based on an analysis of more than 14,000 cats whose owners had taken out private pet insurance .
burmese cats were found to be three times more likely to develop diabetes than any other pedigree breed .

organisers said the security concerns related to media coverage of the event .
miss middleton was due to be part of the all-female crew of the sisterhood , racing against the brotherhood , crewed by men on 25 august .
the beauty v brawn cross-channel challenge was organised to raise money for children 's charities .
a spokeswoman for the sisterhood said : " kate middleton has withdrawn from the race due to security issues surrounding the recent media circus . "
media interest in the race had intensified after speculation miss middleton , 25 , had resumed her relationship with the second-in-line to the throne .
prince william and miss middleton split up earlier this year after a four-year relationship but are reported to have attended several events together during the summer .
world record attempt miss middleton had been persuaded to join the challenge by sisterhood member alicia fox-pitt , a school friend from marlborough college .
she was training to be at the helm of the boat for the race .
the race route covers more than 20 miles of open sea and passes through one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
both crews are attempting to break the world record for a dragon boat crossing , which currently stands at seven hours 45 minutes .
the women are set to become the first all-female team to cross the channel in a dragon boat .
the race is in aid of the babes in arms charity , which sponsors research into abnormalities in newborn babies , and the children 's hospice charity chase .

miss middleton was due to be part of the all-female crew of the sisterhood , racing against the brotherhood , crewed by men on 25 august .
the beauty v brawn cross-channel challenge was organised to raise money for children 's charities .

media interest in the race had intensified after speculation miss middleton , 25 , had resumed her relationship with the second-in-line to the throne .
prince william and miss middleton split up earlier this year after a four-year relationship but are reported to have attended several events together during the summer .
world record attempt miss middleton had been persuaded to join the challenge by sisterhood member alicia fox-pitt , a school friend from marlborough college .
she was training to be at the helm of the boat for the race .
the race route covers more than 20 miles of open sea and passes through one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
both crews are attempting to break the world record for a dragon boat crossing , which currently stands at seven hours 45 minutes .
the women are set to become the first all-female team to cross the channel in a dragon boat .

the activists called for an independent tibet , and claimed the international olympic committee was not holding china accountable for human rights abuses .
the protest comes as china gets ready to mark a year before the beijing olympic games begin , on 8 august 2008 .
the games countdown has also brought protests from other groups , including amnesty and reporters without borders .
highlighting abuses the activists - from canada , the us and britain - unveiled a banner reading " one world , one dream , free tibet 2008 " , on the side of the great wall .
" one world , one dream " is the motto for the 2008 beijing olympics .
activists say china is using the olympics to try to legitimise its claims on tibet , which it says it has ruled for centuries - a fact many tibetans dispute . "
official statements suggest that the olympics are being used to justify such repression " amnesty 's olympics report the protesters were on the wall for about two hours before being detained , according to the group they were with , students for a free tibet .
they were not the only protesters using the olympic countdown to highlight chinese human rights violations .
amnesty international has warned that the image of the games will be tarnished unless china acts urgently to stop abuses .
in a report , the group accused china 's authorities of detaining activists and journalists without trial , in a " clean up " of the capital .
" official statements suggest that the olympics are being used to justify such repression in the name of ' harmony ' or ' social stability ' rather than acting as a catalyst for reform , " said amnesty 's report .
the organisation said china had taken some positive steps in recent months by reforming the death penalty and relaxing restrictions on foreign journalists .
but irene khan , the organisation 's secretary general , said they had also " tightened up the ability of chinese journalists to work " .
" we 've also seen increasing arrests of human rights activists , an increasing use of ' re-education ' through forced labour , and what they call enforced drug rehabilitation , " she said .
the amnesty report follows a visit to beijing by the paris-based organisation reporters without borders , which called for the release of more than 80 jailed journalists and dissidents in china .
members of the organisation demonstrated near the olympic headquarters , wearing black t-shirts showing handcuffs in place of the olympic rings .
" we did n't come to call for a boycott , " said vincent brossel , a spokesman for the group .
" we are calling for concrete achievements , the release of political prisoners , opening of web access and an end to radio jamming . "
meanwhile organisers of the beijing olympics have repeatedly expressed a desire to keep the games non-political .
speaking before the amnesty report had been issued , jiang xiaoyu of the beijing organising committee said : " we welcome even more constructive criticism on faults and problems . "
but he said politicising the event did not " accord with the olympic spirit " .

charities spokesman greg clark said the " social enterprise zones " were aimed at attracting not-for-profit companies to aid communities .
a community bank would channel funds for projects and allocate tax relief , the party will say in a policy taskforce report .
labour said the plans were " uncosted " and could lead to more privatization .
conservative leader david cameron believes economic " enterprise zones " set up by margaret thatcher in the 1980s offer a useful model for community regeneration . "
social enterprises can bring new life , money and jobs into areas of deprivation and begin to turn them round " greg clark conservative charities spokesman mr cameron has already said social enterprise zones are the key to regenerating the poorest areas by encouraging the development of community-focussed organisations like chef jamie oliver 's fifteen group of restaurants .
the report , published on tuesday , takes the process a step further by suggesting tax incentives for companies which reinvest their profits for the benefit of the local people they help and employ .
planning guidance should also be streamlined to recognise the benefits the companies offer to communities , it says .
investments needed the recommendations do not automatically become party policy but they will be given a warm welcome by mr cameron .
mr clark said : " social enterprises can bring new life , money and jobs into areas of deprivation and begin to turn them round .
" but too often they lack access to the capital they need to start up or to grow .
this imaginative proposal would provide cash incentives to bring investors together with social entrepreneurs in the areas where they can make the biggest difference . "
existing measures he said labour efforts to encourage social enterprise were being choked by red tape .
" the government may have the right ideas on this , but their delivery is weak .
they have come up with a lot of initiatives , which tend to overlap each other , " he told the bbc .
" what social enterprises and charities of all kinds tell us is that they are completely tied up in the paperwork and when they do access funds from central government , it comes with so much paperwork and conditions attached that often they drown in it . "
the social enterprise sector consists of about 55,000 companies , such as cafedirect , jamie oliver 's fifteen , and the big issue , which reinvest profits to achieve social goals .
they have a combined turnover of £ 27bn .
charities minister phil hope said the government already offered help to social enterprises but tory councils were reluctant to encourage them .
" there are many local conservative authorities who have been given guidance from government about the relationship between third sector organisations like social enterprises and local authorities , and been given guidance on three-year funding regimes and being able to claim the full cost of the contracts that they engage in .
" if those local conservative councils were to do some of the things we have advised them and given them guidance on now , i think we would see a much greater flourishing of these organisations in these areas . "

the activists called for an independent tibet , and claimed the international olympic committee was not holding china accountable for human rights abuses .
the protest comes as china gets ready to mark a year before the beijing olympic games begin , on 8 august 2008 .
the games countdown has also brought protests from other groups , including amnesty and reporters without borders .
highlighting abuses the activists - from canada , the us and britain - unveiled a banner reading " one world , one dream , free tibet 2008 " , on the side of the great wall .
" one world , one dream " is the motto for the 2008 beijing olympics .
activists say china is using the olympics to try to legitimise its claims on tibet , which it says it has ruled for centuries - a fact many tibetans dispute .
official statements suggest that the olympics are being used to justify such repression amnesty 's olympics report amnesty report the protesters were on the wall for about two hours before being detained , according to the group they were with , students for a free tibet .
they were not the only protesters using the olympic countdown to highlight chinese human rights violations .
amnesty international has warned that the image of the games will be tarnished unless china acts urgently to stop abuses .
in a report , the group accused china 's authorities of detaining activists and journalists without trial , in a " clean up " of the capital .
" official statements suggest that the olympics are being used to justify such repression in the name of ' harmony ' or ' social stability ' rather than acting as a catalyst for reform , " said amnesty 's report .
the organisation said china had taken some positive steps in recent months by reforming the death penalty and relaxing restrictions on foreign journalists .
but irene khan , the organisation 's secretary general , said they had also " tightened up the ability of chinese journalists to work " .
" we 've also seen increasing arrests of human rights activists , an increasing use of ' re-education ' through forced labour , and what they call enforced drug rehabilitation , " she said .
china is gearing up to celebrate one year to go before the olympics the amnesty report follows a visit to beijing by the paris-based organisation reporters without borders , which called for the release of more than 80 jailed journalists and dissidents in china .
members of the organisation demonstrated near the olympic headquarters , wearing black t-shirts showing handcuffs in place of the olympic rings .
" we did n't come to call for a boycott , " said vincent brossel , a spokesman for the group .
" we are calling for concrete achievements , the release of political prisoners , opening of web access and an end to radio jamming . "
meanwhile organisers of the beijing olympics have repeatedly expressed a desire to keep the games non-political .
speaking before the amnesty report had been issued , jiang xiaoyu of the beijing organising committee said : " we welcome even more constructive criticism on faults and problems . "
but he said politicising the event did not " accord with the olympic spirit " .

they were not the only protesters using the olympic countdown to highlight chinese human rights violations .
amnesty international has warned that the image of the games will be tarnished unless china acts urgently to stop abuses .
in a report , the group accused china 's authorities of detaining activists and journalists without trial , in a " clean up " of the capital .
" official statements suggest that the olympics are being used to justify such repression in the name of ' harmony ' or ' social stability ' rather than acting as a catalyst for reform , " said amnesty 's report .
the organisation said china had taken some positive steps in recent months by reforming the death penalty and relaxing restrictions on foreign journalists .
but irene khan , the organisation 's secretary general , said they had also " tightened up the ability of chinese journalists to work " .
" we 've also seen increasing arrests of human rights activists , an increasing use of ' re-education ' through forced labour , and what they call enforced drug rehabilitation , " she said .
china is gearing up to celebrate one year to go before the olympics the amnesty report follows a visit to beijing by the paris-based organisation reporters without borders , which called for the release of more than 80 jailed journalists and dissidents in china .
members of the organisation demonstrated near the olympic headquarters , wearing black t-shirts showing handcuffs in place of the olympic rings .
" we did n't come to call for a boycott , " said vincent brossel , a spokesman for the group .
" we are calling for concrete achievements , the release of political prisoners , opening of web access and an end to radio jamming . "
meanwhile organisers of the beijing olympics have repeatedly expressed a desire to keep the games non-political .
speaking before the amnesty report had been issued , jiang xiaoyu of the beijing organising committee said : " we welcome even more constructive criticism on faults and problems . "
but he said politicising the event did not " accord with the olympic spirit " .

mr entis told the siggraph conference that games makers had to use much more than graphics to make their creations believable , engaging and fun .
game worlds must not just look lifelike , he said , they must also react in a realistic manner too .
tools that let players create content were also becoming important , he said .
siggraph , held in san diego , is the world 's leading computer graphics conference .
during his speech , mr entis warned against assuming that games which look lifelike automatically take on the characteristics of the real world .
he said this problem was most acute when creating believable human video game characters .
exquisitely sensitive humans were so exquisitely sensitive to how other people move and behave , said mr entis , that the smallest differences undermine the almost perfect physical representations of people becoming possible on next-generation consoles such as the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 .
" when a character 's visual appearance creates the expectation of life and it falls short your brain is going to reject that , " he said .
improvements in graphics would not boost believability , he said .
" just adding polygons makes it worse . "
he said that to add authenticity ea had made extensive use of motion capture to catalogue how stance , gait and the tiny movements of facial muscles combine when people display different emotions . "
every part of nature that can respond will respond " glenn entis , ea using this , he said , the game maker had created a movement system for characters that unites these gross and fine-grained changes .
" it gives us alertness and empathy that we have never really had in our games before , " he said .
" model and motion are what gives fidelity for non-interactive characters , " said mr entis , " but it is responsiveness and intelligence that really brings them alive . "
" players have to relate to the characters they are holding in the palm of their hand , " he said .
movement matching the emotion and movement matching system was going to get its first airing in the next release of ea 's basketball game , nba live .
similar demands held true for game worlds as well as the characters that inhabit them , said mr entis .
game worlds must also react in a lifelike manner to whatever people do , he said .
often this can be done via good physics that dictates how scenery reacts when blown up or how liquids or gases move to produce an engaging , thrilling game .
" every part of nature that can respond will respond , " he said .
mr entis said the forthcoming crysis title was a good example of a game in which the responsiveness of the world made it more fun to play .
" it 's about worlds that look beautiful but behave beautifully as well , " said mr entis .
finally , he said , easy to use tools for players were growing in importance and in some cases had become as important as the gameplay itself .
ea research for example , he said , ea research had revealed that more than half the people that played the sims spent more than half the time they play it just making stuff - be it characters or game extras such as furniture .
" they love making the stuff so much that it becomes the game , " he said .
ea was now working on a european xbox 360 title called virtual me that gives players unprecedented control over the looks and wardrobe of the character they create .
the game will be released alongside a tv programme put together by big brother creator endemol .
the move by the games industry to give players more tools , such as the much-anticipated spore game by sim city creator will wright , was like the trend towards user-generated content seen on the web , said mr entis .
" it 's an exploding area , " he said .

mr entis told the siggraph conference that games makers had to use much more than graphics to make their creations believable , engaging and fun .
game worlds must not just look lifelike , he said , they must also react in a realistic manner too .
tools that let players create content were also becoming important , he said .
siggraph , held in san diego , is the world 's leading computer graphics conference .
during his speech , mr entis warned against assuming that games which look lifelike automatically take on the characteristics of the real world .
he said this problem was most acute when creating believable human video game characters .
exquisitely sensitive humans were so exquisitely sensitive to how other people move and behave , said mr entis , that the smallest differences undermine the almost perfect physical representations of people becoming possible on next-generation consoles such as the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 .
" when a character 's visual appearance creates the expectation of life and it falls short your brain is going to reject that , " he said .
improvements in graphics would not boost believability , he said .
" just adding polygons makes it worse . "
he said that to add authenticity ea had made extensive use of motion capture to catalogue how stance , gait and the tiny movements of facial muscles combine when people display different emotions .
every part of nature that can respond will respond glenn entis , ea using this , he said , the game maker had created a movement system for characters that unites these gross and fine-grained changes .
" it gives us alertness and empathy that we have never really had in our games before , " he said .
" model and motion are what gives fidelity for non-interactive characters , " said mr entis , " but it is responsiveness and intelligence that really brings them alive . "
" players have to relate to the characters they are holding in the palm of their hand , " he said .
movement matching the emotion and movement matching system was going to get its first airing in the next release of ea 's basketball game , nba live .
similar demands held true for game worlds as well as the characters that inhabit them , said mr entis .
game worlds must also react in a lifelike manner to whatever people do , he said .
often this can be done via good physics that dictates how scenery reacts when blown up or how liquids or gases move to produce an engaging , thrilling game .
" every part of nature that can respond will respond , " he said .
mr entis said the forthcoming crysis title was a good example of a game in which the responsiveness of the world made it more fun to play .
" it 's about worlds that look beautiful but behave beautifully as well , " said mr entis .
finally , he said , easy to use tools for players were growing in importance and in some cases had become as important as the gameplay itself .
ea research for example , he said , ea research had revealed that more than half the people that played the sims spent more than half the time they play it just making stuff - be it characters or game extras such as furniture .
" they love making the stuff so much that it becomes the game , " he said .
ea was now working on a european xbox 360 title called virtual me that gives players unprecedented control over the looks and wardrobe of the character they create .
the game will be released alongside a tv programme put together by big brother creator endemol .
the move by the games industry to give players more tools , such as the much-anticipated spore game by sim city creator will wright , was like the trend towards user-generated content seen on the web , said mr entis .

ea was now working on a european xbox 360 title called virtual me that gives players unprecedented control over the looks and wardrobe of the character they create .
the game will be released alongside a tv programme put together by big brother creator endemol .

mr entis told the siggraph conference that games makers had to use much more than graphics to make their creations believable , engaging and fun .
game worlds must not just look lifelike , he said , they must also react in a realistic manner too .
tools that let players create content were also becoming important , he said .
siggraph , held in san diego , is the world 's leading computer graphics conference .
during his speech , mr entis warned against assuming that games which look lifelike automatically take on the characteristics of the real world .
he said this problem was most acute when creating believable human video game characters .
exquisitely sensitive humans were so exquisitely sensitive to how other people move and behave , said mr entis , that the smallest differences undermine the almost perfect physical representations of people becoming possible on next-generation consoles such as the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 .
" when a character 's visual appearance creates the expectation of life and it falls short your brain is going to reject that , " he said .
improvements in graphics would not boost believability , he said .
" just adding polygons makes it worse . "
he said that to add authenticity ea had made extensive use of motion capture to catalogue how stance , gait and the tiny movements of facial muscles combine when people display different emotions .
every part of nature that can respond will respond glenn entis , ea using this , he said , the game maker had created a movement system for characters that unites these gross and fine-grained changes .
" it gives us alertness and empathy that we have never really had in our games before , " he said .
" model and motion are what gives fidelity for non-interactive characters , " said mr entis , " but it is responsiveness and intelligence that really brings them alive . "
" players have to relate to the characters they are holding in the palm of their hand , " he said .
movement matching the emotion and movement matching system was going to get its first airing in the next release of ea 's basketball game , nba live .
similar demands held true for game worlds as well as the characters that inhabit them , said mr entis .
game worlds must also react in a lifelike manner to whatever people do , he said .
often this can be done via good physics that dictates how scenery reacts when blown up or how liquids or gases move to produce an engaging , thrilling game .

an increase in the number of rapid response vehicles and the use of gps in control centres have been introduced under mr murray .
a modernisation plan entitled time to make a difference - drawn up in consultation with staff , unions and other healthcare providers - is also set to be implemented in the hope of further improving the service .
but unison 's tony chatfield , branch secretary for the ambulance service in south wales , said the service was not going to change overnight .
" mr murray has provided stability at the top whereas before we had a series of leaders in and out of the door , " he said .
