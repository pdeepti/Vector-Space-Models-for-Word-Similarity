buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .

borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .

for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 04.08.2007 report : germany wants eads ' golden share ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin does n't want to see eads flying into non-european hands the german government intends to take a direct stake in the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- to keep it from falling into non-european hands , a german news magazine said saturday . the german government 's plans calls for it to receive a " golden share , " which would enable berlin to prevent eads from falling under the control of hostile private investors or foreign state-run funds , der speigel news magazine reported on saturday .
a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .
documenta 12 runs until sept .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .
documenta 12 runs until sept .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .

zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .

conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .

" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .
documenta 12 runs until sept .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .

during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .

he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .

during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .
in a recent management shake-up , eads announced it was dropping its joint leadership , with frenchman louis gallois taking sole charge as chief executive and german tom enders assuming control of its subsidiary airbus . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .
documenta 12 runs until sept .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

bayern return to form with league cup win over schalke bayern munich beat schalke 04 in the german league cup and claimed the title for the sixth time .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .

thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .

he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .

buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

buying new stars in a record off-season is n't the only reason . tight stadiums , thunderous chanting , a fighting spirit and beer - it 's a winning combo that 's traditionally made german fans admire english soccer .
but much has changed in the promised land : the premier league doubtlessly still offers the most attractive soccer , but the legendary soccer culture is ailing . clubs are bought up by investors by the dozen .
standing room tickets have been abolished , ticket prices are going through the roof , and the classic viewers have been replaced by more moneyed ones .
there 's a ban on alcohol , the mood 's often mediocre and audiences are dwindling . that 's why england has now found a new role model : the guardian newspaper named germany 's bundesliga an english soccer fan 's utopia . pre-season records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most expensive bavarian ever : franck ribery germany 's soccer passion is bigger than ever .
two weeks ahead of the start of the new season , the 18 clubs in the league had already sold more than 377,000 tickets - a new record . at the same time , the bundesliga also surpassed the previous transfer record that was set in 2001/2002 .
back then , clubs had invested 153 million euros -lrb- $ 209.5 million -rrb- in new legs after getting a lucrative tv deal .
this summer , they 've already spent 165 million euros ahead of the end of the transfer period on aug .
31 . bayern munich alone invested between 60 million and 70 million euros and paid more money for a single player than ever - 25 million euros for franck ribery .
bremen -lrb- carlos alberto : 7.8 million euros -rrb- , hanover -lrb- mike hanke : 4.5 million euros -rrb- , nuremberg -lrb- angelos charisteas : 2.1 million euros -rrb- , stuttgart -lrb- 7 million euros -rrb- and even duisburg -lrb- manasseh ishiaku : 1 million euros -rrb- all broke their previous records . chain reaction this shopping spree can not be explained as a result of high spirits during an economic upswing .
bayern started a chain reaction by completely renewing its team after a disastrous season .
in return , bremen invested the 12 million euros from munich for miroslav klose in new strikers : boubacar sanogo and carlos alberto .
last season 's sensational winner , vfb stuttgart , needs a larger team for its upcoming champions league responsibilities , while nuremberg prepared for the uefa cup .
felix magath meanwhile gave his new club , vfl wolfsburg , a complete overhaul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund fans wo n't be the only ones who want to see their team fight and win even wolfsburg , which notoriously lags behind , is currently experiencing a renaissance with a record-setting 10,000 season tickets sold .
borussia dortmund found buyers for a whopping 50,000 season tickets , followed by schalke -lrb- 44,000 -rrb- and bayern -lrb- 37,000 -rrb- .
eintracht frankfurt even set a new ticket sales record without investing a single euro in transfers , showing that new stars can not be the only reason for the boom . the league is clearly headed for a new audience record even though germany already topped the list in previous years : 39,957 fans attended bundesliga matches on average .
in england , only 32,000 came , 29,000 sat in the stands in spain and 21,000 could be found in italian arenas . great sausage , great stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english might have better soccer , but they sure are missing out on some great sausage explaining the bundesliga 's appeal is not that easy : most world class players can still be found in london , milan or madrid and the bundesliga standard leaves room for improvement .
for years now , german clubs have lagged behind the european elite in the champions league . then what 's the german secret ?
the president of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , wolfgang holzhäuser , cites " great stadiums " and " the world cup aftermath " as reasons .
in england , commentators see the bundesliga as a lost paradise . " above all , there is a sense that the game here has not been hijacked - neither by big commercial interests nor by hooligans , " commented bbc sports reporter margot dunne .
" it still belongs to the , ordinary , decent fans and perhaps that is the secret . " even if these ordinary bundesliga fans sometimes eye the dynamic soccer on the island with a tinge of jealousy , a true soccer fan wants to experience something completely different , according to the guardian - and the bundesliga has it on offer : " a crazy race for the title , cheap tickets , sausage , great stadiums and many goals .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .

thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .

conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .

" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .

less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .

nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .
many come from asia , africa , eastern europe and south america .
buergel called it " slow art " and said it was his goal to reduce the visitors ' pace and let them savor the works .
harsh words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean artist lotty rosenfeld 's work was removed by over-zealous municipal workers but in an interview with regional radio station hessischer rundfunk , art collector rolf ricke called this year 's documenta as the " most boring , conservative , insignificant and humorless exhibition " that he had ever seen .
he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "
the head of wiesbaden museum , volker rattemeyer , has criticized the way that the exhibition is arranged , saying that the art works have been hung together in a " completely unconnected " fashion .
he also described documenta 12 as expressing " a certain degree of helplessness " .
public thumbs-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one can deny that peter friedl 's " the zoo story " stands out from the crowd but for all that , the public seems to like it .
during documenta 's first 50 days , 330,000 visitors had walked through its gates .
buergel also said he has not overheard any critical remarks about the artists or the exhibition .
but the curator said he has also realized that the exhibition does have its flaws .
while he constantly likes to point up the educational character of his documenta , there is no kind of background information to accompany the works - apart from the name of the artists , the year of production , the work 's dimensions and its title .
now he is planning to rectify that .

he added that rather than dealing with contemporary topics , the artworks at the documenta preferred to be preoccupied with themselves to a degree that was " so embarrassing that i could cry . "

but the art world seems less than impressed with what 's on offer this year . and what 's more the event has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
first of all , street cleaners removed a work by lotty rosenfeld , which consisted of white crosses taped to the road .
less than a week later a 12-meter-high -lrb- 30-foot -rrb- open-air artwork , template , fell over in a storm .
making a virtue out of necessity , the chinese artist , ai weiwei , said he found it best as a flattened pile of wreckage and asked that it be left that way for the rest of 100-day exhibition .
inclement weather took its toll again on tuesday when a vast plastic greenhouse , erected as a temporary pavilion and criticized as " cheap , " turned out to have leaked - without , however , causing any damage to the art inside . bad publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this was how ai 's template was intended to look one munich-based tour operator studiosus has threatened to take the organizers to court for allegedly stopping the company 's own guides showing visitors around the exhibition even though official tours are booked out .
nevertheless , the documenta 12 director roger buergel appeared unperturbed , or is , at least , determined to put on a good front .
" i am very happy with the first half , " he said .
" we have managed to divide the public . "
thirty years ago , the german show was able to lure big names such as joseph beuys , salvador dali , roy lichtenstein and andy warhol .
most of the artists in this year 's exhibition are largely unknown in western europe .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .
der spiegel said the golden share option would be limited to involvement in eads , and not applied to other key sectors such as energy or telecoms .
last month , merkel called for an eu-wide plan to protect companies in sensitive areas from being taken over by foreign government-run funds .
golden shares have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies .
germany and france discussed such an option for eads when merkel met president nicholas sarkozy in toulouse last month , although the practice is frowned upon by the european commission .

a german government spokeswoman confirmed saturday that chancellor angela merkel 's administration is looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company .
a golden share is a nominal share that is able to outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover .
germany was forced to take this option because eads is registered under dutch law , and merkel 's government would not be able to use germany 's foreign trade laws to block any changes in the concern 's ownership structure , the magazine said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reportedly hopes that if germany owns just one share , france may sell its eads stake berlin has reportedly also been keen to stop the french state having increased influence in the finely-tuned eads power structure , in which it currently has a direct investment of 15 percent , with the french media group lagardere holding an additional 7.5 percent .
germany 's daimlerchrysler holds 15 percent , while a further 7.5 percent is held by a predominantly german consortium of federal state governments and banks - but with no voting rights .
germany to reduce french eads influence government experts in berlin hope the german move to take a single share will persuade france to do likewise and sell its 15-percent stake in the aerospace giant .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .

cerberus will take over 80.1 percent of the chrysler holding llc for $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros -rrb- , while daimlerchrysler retains a 19.9 percent interest , the company said in an announcement on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche is unlikely to be appearing under banners like this again soon " today marks a new chapter in the history of our company , " said dieter zetsche , chairman of the board of management of daimlerchrysler ag and head of the mercedes car group .
a shareholders ' meeting of daimlerchrysler will decide on the change of name on oct .
4 when the company will be known as daimler ag .
zetsche said details on the effects on the financial statements of daimlerchrysler will be explained on aug .
29 .
conclusion of deal daimlerchrysler agreed in may to sell its loss-making us division to cerberus , but doubts had surfaced recently whether the private equity company could raise the necessary capital in view of the crisis on the us subprime lending market .
as part of the deal , cerberus agreed to take over the pension and health care obligations of chrysler employees .
since the $ 36 billion daimler and chrysler merger in 1998 , the company 's share price has slumped and the group 's market value almost halved .
as a subsidiary of cerberus , chrysler will not be a publicly traded company of its own .
the " new chrysler " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 82-year-old chrysler said it would embark on a new era chrysler llc , as the new company will be called , said it plans to hold a celebration for employees monday and will be rolling out a " new chrysler " campaign through the rest of the year .
" this completion of the deal marks the beginning of a historic opportunity for us to build a company that can compete with the best in the world , " chrysler chief executive tom lasorda told chrysler employees in an e-mail .
after initially battling to make headway in america 's fiercely competitive car sector , chrysler earnings were more recently hit by a shift in the us auto market towards smaller , more energy efficient cars following last year 's jump in gas prices .
in february , daimlerchrysler , which is the manufacturer of the luxury mercedes benz cars , undertook a new effort to revamp chrysler , including slashing 13,000 jobs . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

biggs , 77 , was transferred from high-security belmarsh to norwich prison last month after strokes and heart attacks left him seriously ill .
biggs was jailed for 30 years for his part in the infamous £ 2.6m 1963 heist but escaped and went on the run abroad .
the home office has rejected all previous requests that he should be freed to be with his family .
' compassionate reasons ' biggs ' son michael said : " he still can not speak , hardly walk or read or write but the government still thinks fit to keep him in jail .
" hopefully they will release him now . "
giovanni di stefano , from biggs ' legal team , has sent an e-mail to justice secretary jack straw and the lord chancellor .
he wrote of the prison transfer : " our client has fully appreciated this move but we are instructed to state that the said transfer can not for one moment compensate the need and urgency for our client to spend his remaining period of life with his family for compassionate reasons . "
' prerogative of pardon ' biggs was part of a gang which held up a glasgow-to-london night train in august 1963 , escaping with a then record haul in cash .
he was jailed for 30 years but had only served 15 months when he escaped from wandsworth prison by scaling a rope ladder .
biggs was on the run for 35 years after fleeing to paris and australia and then brazil which has no extradition treaty with the uk .
he returned to britain in 2001 to serve the remainder of his sentence .
mr di stefano added : " the minister of justice will know that a number of british and foreign news media have all supported the call for mr biggs to be granted compassionate release .
" we can also confirm that we have now nearly 7,000 letters from individuals supporting a petition to hm the queen for the prerogative of pardon to be issued . "

biggs , 77 , was transferred from high-security belmarsh to norwich prison last month after strokes and heart attacks left him seriously ill .
biggs was jailed for 30 years for his part in the infamous £ 2.6m 1963 heist but escaped and went on the run abroad .
the home office has rejected all previous requests that he should be freed to be with his family .
' compassionate reasons ' biggs ' son michael said : " he still can not speak , hardly walk or read or write but the government still thinks fit to keep him in jail .

giovanni di stefano , from biggs ' legal team , has sent an e-mail to justice secretary jack straw and the lord chancellor .
he wrote of the prison transfer : " our client has fully appreciated this move but we are instructed to state that the said transfer can not for one moment compensate the need and urgency for our client to spend his remaining period of life with his family for compassionate reasons . "
' prerogative of pardon ' biggs was part of a gang which held up a glasgow-to-london night train in august 1963 , escaping with a then record haul in cash .
he was jailed for 30 years but had only served 15 months when he escaped from wandsworth prison by scaling a rope ladder .
biggs was on the run for 35 years after fleeing to paris and australia and then brazil which has no extradition treaty with the uk .
he returned to britain in 2001 to serve the remainder of his sentence .
mr di stefano added : " the minister of justice will know that a number of british and foreign news media have all supported the call for mr biggs to be granted compassionate release .
" we can also confirm that we have now nearly 7,000 letters from individuals supporting a petition to hm the queen for the prerogative of pardon to be issued . "

biggs , 77 , was transferred from high-security belmarsh to norwich prison last month after strokes and heart attacks left him seriously ill .
biggs was jailed for 30 years for his part in the infamous £ 2.6m 1963 heist but escaped and went on the run abroad .
the home office has rejected all previous requests that he should be freed to be with his family .
' compassionate reasons ' biggs ' son michael said : " he still can not speak , hardly walk or read or write but the government still thinks fit to keep him in jail .
" hopefully they will release him now . "
giovanni di stefano , from biggs ' legal team , has sent an e-mail to justice secretary jack straw and the lord chancellor .
he wrote of the prison transfer : " our client has fully appreciated this move but we are instructed to state that the said transfer can not for one moment compensate the need and urgency for our client to spend his remaining period of life with his family for compassionate reasons . "

sussex farmer jane howard says it is crucial information about infected animals and where they might have moved around the country prior to their diagnosis is given as soon as possible .
she said the authorities were in far a better position to track the movements of the animals involved than at the time of the 2001 outbreak .
mrs howard said as each cow now had its own passport - a measure brought in as a result of the bse crisis - it should be easy to trace where each animal has been .
revealing how much the animals have moved around the uk before their diagnosis would put farmers ' minds at rest , she said .
mrs howard , who has cows , sheep and pigs at cooper 's farm in wadhurst , said the industry was now " hugely regulated " .
as far as farmers are concerned we are all sitting here hoping jane howard if a cow is moved from a farm , the british cattle movement service must be told within three days .
she said : " as far as farmers are concerned we are all sitting here hoping .
" if the animals have n't moved around too much there 's a greater chance that this can be contained than if they had been bought at market last week .
" i ca n't understand why they ca n't tell us that now . "
agricultural show the cranleigh agricultural show was due to take place in surrey on sunday .
mrs howard said : " if this had been found 24 hours later there would have been 400-500 cows from all over the country there .
in a way it is lucky .
police cordons have been set up in the area surrounding the outbreak " everyone feels absolutely sick . "
sally robinson , from boyd 's farm , wiltshire told bbc news 24 she was " absolutely devastated , numb , in complete shock , just ca n't believe it can happen again " .
she said when the disease broke in 2001 , her farm was closed down and she lost her job .
" we all lived on a day to day basis on our nerves , " she added .
mrs robinson said she was satisfied with the government 's response so far .
" i am happier that the movements have stopped quicker than they did last time .
" last time it was detected on 19 february and markets were still going on 23 february , so there was six days of movement .
