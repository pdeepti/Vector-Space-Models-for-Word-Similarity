the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .

it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .

today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .

the pret-a-porter shows with the 2008 spring and summer fashions have already begun .
it is pricey , ready-to-wear clothing - but only for whites . tiguida is a strikingly beautiful young woman with almond-shaped eyes , black hair and heart-shaped lips .

the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .
" paris is the world capital of fashion - for whites . "
an awful scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception : naomi campbell tiguida does commercials for lotions , make-up and hairstyles - for blacks .
even women 's magazines rarely employ blacks .
she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .

today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .

" the west is also threatened by a doctor shortage , " kohler told the german weekly news magazine focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors have repeatedly protested working conditions the president of the german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , agreed .
young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .
numerous specialties affected the problem is a long-standing one in germany , with experts complaining legislators have not acted quickly enough to stem the flow of doctors out of the country .
but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .
this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.10.2007 opinion : europe must find a common voice in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel posed for all the right pictures during her recent africa tour , but what 's missing is a joint eu policy on the neighboring continent , says dw 's ute schaeffer . the pictures were well chosen : a group of cute ethiopian kids , representing poverty in africa , where germany sends humanitarian aid .
an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 1.79 meters -lrb- 5 feet 11 inches -rrb- , 56 kilograms -lrb- 124 pounds -rrb- and measurements of 83-63-91 centimeters -lrb- 33-25-36 inches -rrb- , she has the figure of the perfect model .
the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .
" paris is the world capital of fashion - for whites . "
an awful scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception : naomi campbell tiguida does commercials for lotions , make-up and hairstyles - for blacks .
even women 's magazines rarely employ blacks .
she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .
" it was an awful scandal , " rabanne said .
" after the show , american fashion journalists came backstage and almost spit in my face .
they said haute couture is reserved for white women and not those girls over there . "
wanted : blonde , tall and thin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blonde and white is preferred during fashion shows , the phones practically ring off the hook at well-known fashion agency elite , when designers choose models for their collections .
elite discovered black top model naomi campbell .
today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .
in italy , designers simply book more blacks .
away from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another exception : iman for tiguida this meant moving abroad .
in mid-october she will travel first to mali and then to the festival of african fashion in niger , then to south africa and the us to model .
it 's only a slight consolation that others in the industry , such as models from the maghreb region , are even worse off .
an arab friend of hers decided to go back to school after three years of modeling because she could n't find any work .
" she really tried everything , " tiguida said .
" she could work abroad , but her family does n't want to let her go .
that 's why she quit - she can not work in france . " martina zimmermann -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

8 , hoping to iron out their differences on what to do about the euro , whose strength against the dollar is blamed by some leaders for their countries ' economic woes . ministers from the 13-member european shared currency club aim to forge a common stance ahead of next week 's group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting in washington .
but divisions over the desirability of the " supereuro " remain . the european union 's common currency was trading at below $ 1.20 in late 2005 but has surged ever since .
last week it hit a record high of $ 1.4281 .
the euro slipped to under $ 1.41 in european trading monday . the most vocal critics of a strong european currency are france and italy , which complain that it is damaging business by ramping up export costs . european bearing brunt of weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone has had a difficult time reaching a common position on the weak dollar " there can be little doubt that the run of recent highs for the common currency have been hampering the euro zone 's competitive position , " james hughes , a market analyst at cmc markets , told the associated press . but the united states , carrying a large trade deficit , no longer appears interested in pursuing a strong dollar , experts say .
and while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , in remarks to the financial times , argued that europe should not have to bear the brunt of " the consequences of the existing global imbalances , " it 's unlikely he 'll convince his colleagues to intervene in currency markets . " to date the eurogroup has been a bit like your local amateur operatic society : a couple of good strong voices , but the chorus is all over the shop , " westpac bank strategist robert rennie told reuters . berlin unperturbed by current rates germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , reiterated its support for a strong euro .

" i love cash and a strong euro . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has n't been up nights worrying about the euro being too strong economy minister michael glos agreed , saying current exchange rate " has n't been giving us any sleepless nights , " though he added that berlin may become concerned if the dollar 's decline continued . manufacturing data out of germany on monday showed continued strong foreign demand , despite the euro 's rise .
german manufacturing orders rebounded by 1.2 percent in august on a monthly basis following a decline of 6.1 percent in july , economy ministry figures showed . orders from outside the euro zone were up by 3.5 percent , well ahead of the 1.0 percent increase in orders from germany 's euro-zone partners .
domestic orders climbed just 0.1 percent . " the strong rise in non-euro-zone exports appears to underscore the view that the record high euro / dollar is not derailing german export industry , " alexander koch of unicredit told the afp news agency . eu to discuss us housing market euro-zone finance ministers will be joined by their colleagues from the entire 27-member european union on tuesday for talks expected to focus on greater transparency in financial markets after the global turmoil caused by this summer 's sub-prime mortgage crisis in the us . ministers were also expected to discuss labor-market policies adopted in several member states , most notably in denmark , the netherlands , spain and ireland . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .
" it was an awful scandal , " rabanne said .
" after the show , american fashion journalists came backstage and almost spit in my face .
they said haute couture is reserved for white women and not those girls over there . "
wanted : blonde , tall and thin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blonde and white is preferred during fashion shows , the phones practically ring off the hook at well-known fashion agency elite , when designers choose models for their collections .
elite discovered black top model naomi campbell .
today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .
in italy , designers simply book more blacks .
away from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another exception : iman for tiguida this meant moving abroad .
in mid-october she will travel first to mali and then to the festival of african fashion in niger , then to south africa and the us to model .
it 's only a slight consolation that others in the industry , such as models from the maghreb region , are even worse off .
an arab friend of hers decided to go back to school after three years of modeling because she could n't find any work .
" she really tried everything , " tiguida said .
" she could work abroad , but her family does n't want to let her go .
that 's why she quit - she can not work in france . " martina zimmermann -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .

the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .

the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .

african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .

the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .

while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .

" the west is also threatened by a doctor shortage , " kohler told the german weekly news magazine focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors have repeatedly protested working conditions the president of the german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , agreed .
young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .
numerous specialties affected the problem is a long-standing one in germany , with experts complaining legislators have not acted quickly enough to stem the flow of doctors out of the country .
but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .
this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .
urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .

the pret-a-porter shows with the 2008 spring and summer fashions have already begun .
it is pricey , ready-to-wear clothing - but only for whites . tiguida is a strikingly beautiful young woman with almond-shaped eyes , black hair and heart-shaped lips .
at 1.79 meters -lrb- 5 feet 11 inches -rrb- , 56 kilograms -lrb- 124 pounds -rrb- and measurements of 83-63-91 centimeters -lrb- 33-25-36 inches -rrb- , she has the figure of the perfect model .
the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .
" paris is the world capital of fashion - for whites . "
an awful scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception : naomi campbell tiguida does commercials for lotions , make-up and hairstyles - for blacks .
even women 's magazines rarely employ blacks .
she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .
" it was an awful scandal , " rabanne said .
" after the show , american fashion journalists came backstage and almost spit in my face .
they said haute couture is reserved for white women and not those girls over there . "
wanted : blonde , tall and thin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blonde and white is preferred during fashion shows , the phones practically ring off the hook at well-known fashion agency elite , when designers choose models for their collections .
elite discovered black top model naomi campbell .
today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .
in italy , designers simply book more blacks .
away from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another exception : iman for tiguida this meant moving abroad .
in mid-october she will travel first to mali and then to the festival of african fashion in niger , then to south africa and the us to model .
it 's only a slight consolation that others in the industry , such as models from the maghreb region , are even worse off .
an arab friend of hers decided to go back to school after three years of modeling because she could n't find any work .
" she really tried everything , " tiguida said .
" she could work abroad , but her family does n't want to let her go .
that 's why she quit - she can not work in france . " martina zimmermann -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors have repeatedly protested working conditions the president of the german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , agreed .
young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .
numerous specialties affected the problem is a long-standing one in germany , with experts complaining legislators have not acted quickly enough to stem the flow of doctors out of the country .
but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .
this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .
urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .

the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel .

the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .

the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .

sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .

most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.10.2007 opinion : europe must find a common voice in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel posed for all the right pictures during her recent africa tour , but what 's missing is a joint eu policy on the neighboring continent , says dw 's ute schaeffer . the pictures were well chosen : a group of cute ethiopian kids , representing poverty in africa , where germany sends humanitarian aid .
an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .
numerous specialties affected the problem is a long-standing one in germany , with experts complaining legislators have not acted quickly enough to stem the flow of doctors out of the country .
but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .

urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .

german manufacturing orders rebounded by 1.2 percent in august on a monthly basis following a decline of 6.1 percent in july , economy ministry figures showed . orders from outside the euro zone were up by 3.5 percent , well ahead of the 1.0 percent increase in orders from germany 's euro-zone partners .

8 , hoping to iron out their differences on what to do about the euro , whose strength against the dollar is blamed by some leaders for their countries ' economic woes . ministers from the 13-member european shared currency club aim to forge a common stance ahead of next week 's group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting in washington .
but divisions over the desirability of the " supereuro " remain . the european union 's common currency was trading at below $ 1.20 in late 2005 but has surged ever since .
last week it hit a record high of $ 1.4281 .
the euro slipped to under $ 1.41 in european trading monday . the most vocal critics of a strong european currency are france and italy , which complain that it is damaging business by ramping up export costs . european bearing brunt of weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone has had a difficult time reaching a common position on the weak dollar " there can be little doubt that the run of recent highs for the common currency have been hampering the euro zone 's competitive position , " james hughes , a market analyst at cmc markets , told the associated press . but the united states , carrying a large trade deficit , no longer appears interested in pursuing a strong dollar , experts say .
and while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , in remarks to the financial times , argued that europe should not have to bear the brunt of " the consequences of the existing global imbalances , " it 's unlikely he 'll convince his colleagues to intervene in currency markets .

" i love cash and a strong euro . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has n't been up nights worrying about the euro being too strong economy minister michael glos agreed , saying current exchange rate " has n't been giving us any sleepless nights , " though he added that berlin may become concerned if the dollar 's decline continued . manufacturing data out of germany on monday showed continued strong foreign demand , despite the euro 's rise .
german manufacturing orders rebounded by 1.2 percent in august on a monthly basis following a decline of 6.1 percent in july , economy ministry figures showed . orders from outside the euro zone were up by 3.5 percent , well ahead of the 1.0 percent increase in orders from germany 's euro-zone partners .
domestic orders climbed just 0.1 percent . " the strong rise in non-euro-zone exports appears to underscore the view that the record high euro / dollar is not derailing german export industry , " alexander koch of unicredit told the afp news agency . eu to discuss us housing market euro-zone finance ministers will be joined by their colleagues from the entire 27-member european union on tuesday for talks expected to focus on greater transparency in financial markets after the global turmoil caused by this summer 's sub-prime mortgage crisis in the us . ministers were also expected to discuss labor-market policies adopted in several member states , most notably in denmark , the netherlands , spain and ireland . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , hoping to iron out their differences on what to do about the euro , whose strength against the dollar is blamed by some leaders for their countries ' economic woes . ministers from the 13-member european shared currency club aim to forge a common stance ahead of next week 's group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting in washington .
but divisions over the desirability of the " supereuro " remain . the european union 's common currency was trading at below $ 1.20 in late 2005 but has surged ever since .
last week it hit a record high of $ 1.4281 .
the euro slipped to under $ 1.41 in european trading monday . the most vocal critics of a strong european currency are france and italy , which complain that it is damaging business by ramping up export costs . european bearing brunt of weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone has had a difficult time reaching a common position on the weak dollar " there can be little doubt that the run of recent highs for the common currency have been hampering the euro zone 's competitive position , " james hughes , a market analyst at cmc markets , told the associated press . but the united states , carrying a large trade deficit , no longer appears interested in pursuing a strong dollar , experts say .
and while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , in remarks to the financial times , argued that europe should not have to bear the brunt of " the consequences of the existing global imbalances , " it 's unlikely he 'll convince his colleagues to intervene in currency markets . " to date the eurogroup has been a bit like your local amateur operatic society : a couple of good strong voices , but the chorus is all over the shop , " westpac bank strategist robert rennie told reuters . berlin unperturbed by current rates germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , reiterated its support for a strong euro .

german manufacturing orders rebounded by 1.2 percent in august on a monthly basis following a decline of 6.1 percent in july , economy ministry figures showed . orders from outside the euro zone were up by 3.5 percent , well ahead of the 1.0 percent increase in orders from germany 's euro-zone partners .

young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .
numerous specialties affected the problem is a long-standing one in germany , with experts complaining legislators have not acted quickly enough to stem the flow of doctors out of the country .
but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .
this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .
urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.10.2007 opinion : europe must find a common voice in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel posed for all the right pictures during her recent africa tour , but what 's missing is a joint eu policy on the neighboring continent , says dw 's ute schaeffer . the pictures were well chosen : a group of cute ethiopian kids , representing poverty in africa , where germany sends humanitarian aid .
an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .

this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .
urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .

the pret-a-porter shows with the 2008 spring and summer fashions have already begun .
it is pricey , ready-to-wear clothing - but only for whites . tiguida is a strikingly beautiful young woman with almond-shaped eyes , black hair and heart-shaped lips .
at 1.79 meters -lrb- 5 feet 11 inches -rrb- , 56 kilograms -lrb- 124 pounds -rrb- and measurements of 83-63-91 centimeters -lrb- 33-25-36 inches -rrb- , she has the figure of the perfect model .
the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .
" paris is the world capital of fashion - for whites . "
an awful scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception : naomi campbell tiguida does commercials for lotions , make-up and hairstyles - for blacks .
even women 's magazines rarely employ blacks .
she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .
" it was an awful scandal , " rabanne said .
" after the show , american fashion journalists came backstage and almost spit in my face .
they said haute couture is reserved for white women and not those girls over there . "
wanted : blonde , tall and thin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blonde and white is preferred during fashion shows , the phones practically ring off the hook at well-known fashion agency elite , when designers choose models for their collections .
elite discovered black top model naomi campbell .
today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .
in italy , designers simply book more blacks .
away from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another exception : iman for tiguida this meant moving abroad .
in mid-october she will travel first to mali and then to the festival of african fashion in niger , then to south africa and the us to model .
it 's only a slight consolation that others in the industry , such as models from the maghreb region , are even worse off .
an arab friend of hers decided to go back to school after three years of modeling because she could n't find any work .
" she really tried everything , " tiguida said .
" she could work abroad , but her family does n't want to let her go .
that 's why she quit - she can not work in france . " martina zimmermann -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.10.2007 opinion : europe must find a common voice in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel posed for all the right pictures during her recent africa tour , but what 's missing is a joint eu policy on the neighboring continent , says dw 's ute schaeffer . the pictures were well chosen : a group of cute ethiopian kids , representing poverty in africa , where germany sends humanitarian aid .
an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german doctors have repeatedly protested working conditions the president of the german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , agreed .
young doctors are increasingly moving away from germany because they earn more and have better working conditions in other countries , hoppe told focus .

but up to now it has been most pronounced in the country 's poorer eastern half .
now , poorer western regions , like lower saxony , westphalia , and upper franconia , are seeing shortages of doctors in the countryside , the magazine reported , citing yet-unreleased data from the kvb and the german medical association .
this included a shortage of optometrists , gynaecologists , dermatologists and neurologists , the groups said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young doctors prefer city hospitals to rural practices in may , the government proposed legislation aiming to fix the problem .
among other changes , it would relax practitioner law to allow doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , raise the retirement age , and allowing physicians to hire colleagues to work for them .
health ministry officials have said , however , that they do not expect the law to usher in major changes .
urgent plea for change meanwhile , hoppe , the medical association 's president , said swift and sweeping change is needed in government health care policy - or else .
" we will slide irrevocably toward a crisis in health-care coverage if the basic working conditions for doctors do not improve very quickly , " he said in his interview with focus . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a clear chance for success in afghanistan , " jung said in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overly optimistic ?
jung thinks afghanistan can work the minister said only a combined strategy of military protection , reconstruction and winning the hearts and minds of people in afghanistan could do the job . " we ca n't win only by military means , " he said , adding that there could be no talk of withdrawing troops . " only when the security there is self-sustaining can be begin to talk about withdrawing , " he said . the canadian ambassador to germany , paul dubois also urged germany to keep up its involvement in afghanistan . " even if it 's not easy … we must continue to work there together and should n't doubt the mission , " he said in a radio interview .
canada is one of the strongest us allies in afghanistan . public support for afghan mission waning their comments came five days before germany 's parliament votes on extending germany 's participation in the multinational nato-led international isaf force as well as the deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets to assist the mission . germany has some 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country and has resisted pressure within nato to send peacekeepers to volatile southern afghanistan where us-led forces are fighting insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are wary of keeping their troops in afghanistan public support for the german army 's mission in afghanistan is waning .
recent polls showed 52 percent saying that germany should withdraw its troops . that skepticism is shared by the opposition green party which recently voted at a stormy party conference against extending the mandate of german troops and spy jets in afghanistan . public needs convincing former foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the green party , recently said he could understand germans ' squeamishness over the country 's deployment in afghanistan , saying it was a lesson they had drawn from their bloody history . " i think it is good that there is a fundamental skepticism on military missions , " fischer said .
" that is something i appreciate about germany and that i often mention when i travel . " at the same time , more needs to be done to convince the german public of the importance of having peacekeepers in afghanistan , some say . fischer said chancellor merkel needed to do more to convince germans of the afghanistan mission 's importance . that view was echoed by jung . " we have to make it clear how important stability and peace in afghanistan is for us , " jung said .
" it 's always more clever to nip danger in the bud before it comes to us , " he said , referring to the threat of terrorism that the region holds . " biggest challenge in the coming year " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the training of afghan forces has been hampered by problems jung also promised to boost the training of afghan armed forces and the police who are being trained by a special eu mission led by germany .
the project however has come under fire for lacking adequate planning and funds . the commander of german isaf forces in the north of afghanistan , brigadier-general dieter warnecke , told the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag that boosting the afghan forces was " the biggest challenge in the coming year .

8 , hoping to iron out their differences on what to do about the euro , whose strength against the dollar is blamed by some leaders for their countries ' economic woes . ministers from the 13-member european shared currency club aim to forge a common stance ahead of next week 's group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting in washington .
but divisions over the desirability of the " supereuro " remain . the european union 's common currency was trading at below $ 1.20 in late 2005 but has surged ever since .
last week it hit a record high of $ 1.4281 .
the euro slipped to under $ 1.41 in european trading monday . the most vocal critics of a strong european currency are france and italy , which complain that it is damaging business by ramping up export costs . european bearing brunt of weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone has had a difficult time reaching a common position on the weak dollar " there can be little doubt that the run of recent highs for the common currency have been hampering the euro zone 's competitive position , " james hughes , a market analyst at cmc markets , told the associated press . but the united states , carrying a large trade deficit , no longer appears interested in pursuing a strong dollar , experts say .
and while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , in remarks to the financial times , argued that europe should not have to bear the brunt of " the consequences of the existing global imbalances , " it 's unlikely he 'll convince his colleagues to intervene in currency markets . " to date the eurogroup has been a bit like your local amateur operatic society : a couple of good strong voices , but the chorus is all over the shop , " westpac bank strategist robert rennie told reuters . berlin unperturbed by current rates germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , reiterated its support for a strong euro . " i prefer a strong euro , i always prefer strong developments , " german finance minister peer steinbrück said before monday 's meeting .
" i love cash and a strong euro . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has n't been up nights worrying about the euro being too strong economy minister michael glos agreed , saying current exchange rate " has n't been giving us any sleepless nights , " though he added that berlin may become concerned if the dollar 's decline continued . manufacturing data out of germany on monday showed continued strong foreign demand , despite the euro 's rise .
german manufacturing orders rebounded by 1.2 percent in august on a monthly basis following a decline of 6.1 percent in july , economy ministry figures showed . orders from outside the euro zone were up by 3.5 percent , well ahead of the 1.0 percent increase in orders from germany 's euro-zone partners .

an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an emotional handshake with the legendary nelson mandela , who stands more than anyone else for the emancipation and democratization of the continent .
economically flourishing landscapes on the cape that stand for south africa as germany 's strongest economic partner .
and at the end of the trip , africa 's power woman , ellen johnson-sirleaf , who wants to liberate liberia from the tragic legacy of civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer foreign policy is more than photo shoots .
the fact that germany put the continent on the top of the agenda during its g8 presidency is much more important than the chancellor 's first africa visit .
merkel acted as an advocate for the neighboring continent during the g8 conference in heiligendamm and it was germany 's european council presidency that paved the way for the upcoming eu-africa summit in december - the first meeting of its kind in seven years . the seven-year gap reveals what the lively diplomacy toward africa only tries to cover up - that is , the lack of communication between europe and africa .
it 's bizarre that after decades of difficult relations , visitors from europe show up in africa and claim they are there to ask questions and learn something . europe 's politicians are still looking for the answer to africa 's problems .
each one of them is searching in its own way for the key that fits all the countries on the continent - the african panacea . but such a key does n't exist , and neither the african union nor the development organizations can create one .
in order to ensure development , peace and stability in the 48 states in sub-saharan africa , 48 different policies have to be found .
while there are places - like the sahel region - that will always be primarily dependent on development aid , straight-lined economic cooperation is essential to the others . europe must respond to these differences audibly and with one voice .
it has to formulate common interests and reach agreements .
the problem is that the european leaders come alone and only speak for their own country .
sarkozy toured africa , even beyond the francophone region , together with a large economic delegation .
great britain still maintains relations to its former colonies . in africa , it 's more apparent than anywhere else that a common european foreign policy is an illusion .
here , each country looks out for itself .
african critics are right when they call this a policy of post-colonial interests .
in this way , europe continues to lose ground to china , the powerhouse in the east , and africa is still the loser , regardless of how much development money is pumped into it . the chancellor has recognized this and that 's why she 's working toward a stronger common european policy on africa .
it 's easier for germany , because it has fewer personal interests than some of its neighbors . the africa-eu summit in december will reveal whether merkel is able to convince her european partners or not .
the objective is ambitious : coherence rather than a checkerboard foreign policy based on old colonial borders . instead of conflict over distribution among the development , foreign policy and economic departments , the focus will be on combining different political sectors .
this is something germany is not particularly good at . in the end , the collage of nice africa pictures , which added a colorful touch to the chancellor 's recent trip , does n't make for an africa policy . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french , however , appear not to think so .
as the daughter of parents from mali and niger , she 's not part of the pret-a-porter fashion shows currently underway in paris .
in fact , she rarely works as a model for fashion shows .
no matter that the face is flawless and the size is right : a black model has a particularly tough time in the paris fashion world .
" at the paris fashion shows , there are n't even two black models , but just one : a black model or a model of mixed races .
not two , just a single one , " the 19-year old said .
" paris is the world capital of fashion - for whites . "
an awful scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception : naomi campbell tiguida does commercials for lotions , make-up and hairstyles - for blacks .
even women 's magazines rarely employ blacks .
she has gone to auditions for marie claire but has never been hired - though a biracial model was , tiguida said .
" in london and italy , black models get work , " she said .
" but not in france .
that 's racism . "
it was in 1964 that fashion designer paco rabanne sent a black model walking down a runway for the first time .
she wore a wedding dress made of white plastic .
" it was an awful scandal , " rabanne said .
" after the show , american fashion journalists came backstage and almost spit in my face .

elite discovered black top model naomi campbell .
today , however , the agency only has two models of color , a jamaican from new york and a biracial frenchwoman .
sabine killinger , vice president of elite paris , said there simply is n't enough work for more black models .
she added that this was n't the fault of model agencies , who are just suppliers for the fashion houses , magazines , advertising clients and catalogues .
lacking global appeal ?
advertising campaigns are made for the world market , and only models who appeal to the whole world are considered , she said .
" a black model does not appeal to asia , " killinger said .
" there are also stories that there is n't necessarily much love between the arabs and blacks . "
the fashion industry is about identification and customers prefer to dream about a blonde , tall and slim girl , rather than someone who is black , killinger said .
few agencies specializing in black models have been established in paris .
most of them , however , had to shut down .
" mode black " survived , because the company also functions as a communications agency and does not only manage black models .
in europe , blacks can only live off modeling in england or italy , according to " mode black . " in england , that 's possible because of the local black communities and the ethnic advertising that caters to them .
in italy , designers simply book more blacks .

it 's only a slight consolation that others in the industry , such as models from the maghreb region , are even worse off .
an arab friend of hers decided to go back to school after three years of modeling because she could n't find any work .

with most of the votes counted , mr arias said the treaty had been narrowly approved in a referendum .
the treaty gives costa rica greater access to the us market .
opponents of the deal fear increased competition could ruin the country 's successful economy and put the welfare system at risk .
" the people of costa rica have said yes to the free trade agreement , and that for me is a sacred wish , " mr arias said in a televised address to the nation .
with 89 % of votes counted , 51.7 % backed the treaty .
five other central american countries have already ratified the agreement .
costa rica is the only country to hold a referendum on the central american free trade agreement , which will also cover guatemala , el salvador , honduras , nicaragua and the dominican republic .
correspondents say its adoption by costa rica will be welcomed by washington , which is keen to maintain its influence in latin america to counter that of socialist leaders in venezuela and cuba .
development opportunity supporters of the trade pact say it is a unique development opportunity that will benefit costa rica since it is a small country with few natural resources .
but critics object to requirements that costa rica open its telecommunications and agricultural sectors to greater competition , and fear it may flood the market with cheap imports .
costa ricans have for many years enjoyed more stability and a higher standard of living and public services than their neighbours in central america .
earlier mr arias said a " no " vote would undermine that position .
" costa rica would be saying ' no ' to a market of 300 million inhabitants , and that would be a grave error , " he said .
the issue has provoked repeated protests in costa rica , including a two-day strike by public workers last year .

work has begun on a 4,130km -lrb- 2,560-mile -rrb- oil pipeline - the longest pipeline in the world 's largest country .
the plan is to feed the growing demand for oil in china and russia 's other energy-hungry east asian neighbours .
the government of russia 's sakha republic - better known as yakutia - backs the pipeline , arguing that the whole region will benefit economically .
the collapse of the soviet union left many siberians struggling to make a living .
at first nikolai martynov , an ethnic evenk , thought russia 's natural resources would bring his people wealth .
but he says thousands of reindeer have been " driven away by the building work for the pipeline and other projects and we have fewer and fewer " .
" selling the meat and fur is no longer profitable , " says mr martynov , who has been a deer herder for 45 years .
east siberian pipeline length : 4,130km capacity : 80m tonnes annually first stage -lrb- to skovorodino near china border -rrb- to be finished in 2008 second stage -lrb- to perevoznaya on pacific coast -rrb- - by 2015 project cost : $ 11.5bn -lrb- £ 6.4bn -rrb- he lives in khotustir , a community near the pipeline , which is home to 2,000 people .
the evenk live in villages scattered across an expanse of siberian forest known as taiga .
they have an unreliable income and depend on the nature around them - or on a small amount of manual labour offered to them by the energy companies .
densely forested hills stretch as far as the eye can see , but the region also boasts a gold mine and there are plans to exploit uranium too .
railway workers are busy constructing a new track linking the capital yakutsk with the main southern siberian network .
hydroelectric power the river aldan - the main water supply for khotustir and many other villages - is also being exploited as an energy source .
one firm , rao-ess , plans to construct no less than five hydroelectric power plants .
it promises jobs .
but mr martynov is not convinced .
" the last time the company employed people from my village , our salaries dried up .
we are still owed four months ' wages , " he says .
" there has been very little discussion .
i think every member of this community should be allowed a share of the profits from the hydroelectric stations . "
the company building the oil pipeline , transneft , forecasts that oil consumption in china and its east asian neighbours will grow by more than 50 % by 2010 and more than double by 2020 .
transneft recently announced there would be jobs for more than 1,000 chinese construction workers , but only 200 for indigenous people .
pavel anisimov , leader of the khotustir community , says he is disappointed the work has started on the pipeline , even though the final agreement between transneft and the government of yakutia has yet to be signed .
" we have a different lifestyle .
we can provide tree fellers but we do not have the specialists required by the companies .
at the same time we are losing the territory where we herd and hunt animals , " he says .
" most workers are not provided with contracts , " explains mr anisimov .
" there is a complicated structure of companies working on top of one another .
it may be that that structure is illegal , but it is hard to know who to sue . "
transneft officials were not available for comment .
according to a yakutia government spokesman , " a contract will be signed , compensation to the indigenous people will be granted " .
" the whole republic is set to gain from the revenue . "
putin intervenes originally , the pipeline would have run just 800m -lrb- 2,600ft -rrb- from the shores of lake baikal , the world 's deepest body of fresh water and a unique home for many rare species .
but after protests from environmentalists president vladimir putin announced that the pipeline would be rerouted well away from the lake .
viktor kuznetsov , executive director of the association of minority peoples , has studied the impact of energy projects on the evenk people .
he says that since 2001 , the number of reindeer in the irkutsk region - on which the evenk economy depends - has diminished by 10 % .
he accuses energy companies of commissioning reports to boost their own credibility .
one report by the irkutsk-based institute of geography suggested that the evenk community need only be compensated for a loss of nine us dollars -lrb- 225 roubles ; £ 4.50 -rrb- per year - a sum mr kuznetsov says is laughably small compared with their actual losses .
he says the evenk are losing thousands of hectares of hunting grounds - home to numerous squirrels , elk and sable .

densely forested hills stretch as far as the eye can see , but the region also boasts a gold mine and there are plans to exploit uranium too .
railway workers are busy constructing a new track linking the capital yakutsk with the main southern siberian network .
hydroelectric power the river aldan - the main water supply for khotustir and many other villages - is also being exploited as an energy source .
the remote city of yakutsk is getting a major new rail link one firm , rao-ess , plans to construct no less than five hydroelectric power plants .
it promises jobs .
but mr martynov is not convinced .
" the last time the company employed people from my village , our salaries dried up .
we are still owed four months ' wages , " he says .
" there has been very little discussion .
i think every member of this community should be allowed a share of the profits from the hydroelectric stations . "
the company building the oil pipeline , transneft , forecasts that oil consumption in china and its east asian neighbours will grow by more than 50 % by 2010 and more than double by 2020 .
transneft recently announced there would be jobs for more than 1,000 chinese construction workers , but only 200 for indigenous people .
pavel anisimov , leader of the khotustir community , says he is disappointed the work has started on the pipeline , even though the final agreement between transneft and the government of yakutia has yet to be signed .
" we have a different lifestyle .
we can provide tree fellers but we do not have the specialists required by the companies .
at the same time we are losing the territory where we herd and hunt animals , " he says .
" most workers are not provided with contracts , " explains mr anisimov .
pipelines and new roads threaten to reduce the siberian wilderness " there is a complicated structure of companies working on top of one another .
it may be that that structure is illegal , but it is hard to know who to sue . "
transneft officials were not available for comment .
according to a yakutia government spokesman , " a contract will be signed , compensation to the indigenous people will be granted " .
" the whole republic is set to gain from the revenue . "
putin intervenes originally , the pipeline would have run just 800m -lrb- 2,600ft -rrb- from the shores of lake baikal , the world 's deepest body of fresh water and a unique home for many rare species .
but after protests from environmentalists president vladimir putin announced that the pipeline would be rerouted well away from the lake .
viktor kuznetsov , executive director of the association of minority peoples , has studied the impact of energy projects on the evenk people .
he says that since 2001 , the number of reindeer in the irkutsk region - on which the evenk economy depends - has diminished by 10 % .
he accuses energy companies of commissioning reports to boost their own credibility .
one report by the irkutsk-based institute of geography suggested that the evenk community need only be compensated for a loss of nine us dollars -lrb- 225 roubles ; £ 4.50 -rrb- per year - a sum mr kuznetsov says is laughably small compared with their actual losses .
he says the evenk are losing thousands of hectares of hunting grounds - home to numerous squirrels , elk and sable .

work has begun on a 4,130km -lrb- 2,560-mile -rrb- oil pipeline - the longest pipeline in the world 's largest country .
the plan is to feed the growing demand for oil in china and russia 's other energy-hungry east asian neighbours .
the government of russia 's sakha republic - better known as yakutia - backs the pipeline , arguing that the whole region will benefit economically .
the collapse of the soviet union left many siberians struggling to make a living .
at first nikolai martynov , an ethnic evenk , thought russia 's natural resources would bring his people wealth .
but he says thousands of reindeer have been " driven away by the building work for the pipeline and other projects and we have fewer and fewer " .
" selling the meat and fur is no longer profitable , " says mr martynov , who has been a deer herder for 45 years .
east siberian pipeline length : 4,130km capacity : 80m tonnes annually first stage -lrb- to skovorodino near china border -rrb- to be finished in 2008 second stage -lrb- to perevoznaya on pacific coast -rrb- - by 2015 project cost : $ 11.5bn -lrb- £ 6.4bn -rrb- he lives in khotustir , a community near the pipeline , which is home to 2,000 people .
the evenk live in villages scattered across an expanse of siberian forest known as taiga .
they have an unreliable income and depend on the nature around them - or on a small amount of manual labour offered to them by the energy companies .
densely forested hills stretch as far as the eye can see , but the region also boasts a gold mine and there are plans to exploit uranium too .
railway workers are busy constructing a new track linking the capital yakutsk with the main southern siberian network .
hydroelectric power the river aldan - the main water supply for khotustir and many other villages - is also being exploited as an energy source .
the remote city of yakutsk is getting a major new rail link one firm , rao-ess , plans to construct no less than five hydroelectric power plants .
it promises jobs .
but mr martynov is not convinced .
" the last time the company employed people from my village , our salaries dried up .
we are still owed four months ' wages , " he says .
" there has been very little discussion .
i think every member of this community should be allowed a share of the profits from the hydroelectric stations . "
the company building the oil pipeline , transneft , forecasts that oil consumption in china and its east asian neighbours will grow by more than 50 % by 2010 and more than double by 2020 .
transneft recently announced there would be jobs for more than 1,000 chinese construction workers , but only 200 for indigenous people .
pavel anisimov , leader of the khotustir community , says he is disappointed the work has started on the pipeline , even though the final agreement between transneft and the government of yakutia has yet to be signed .
" we have a different lifestyle .
we can provide tree fellers but we do not have the specialists required by the companies .
at the same time we are losing the territory where we herd and hunt animals , " he says .
" most workers are not provided with contracts , " explains mr anisimov .
pipelines and new roads threaten to reduce the siberian wilderness " there is a complicated structure of companies working on top of one another .
it may be that that structure is illegal , but it is hard to know who to sue . "
transneft officials were not available for comment .
according to a yakutia government spokesman , " a contract will be signed , compensation to the indigenous people will be granted " .
" the whole republic is set to gain from the revenue . "
putin intervenes originally , the pipeline would have run just 800m -lrb- 2,600ft -rrb- from the shores of lake baikal , the world 's deepest body of fresh water and a unique home for many rare species .
but after protests from environmentalists president vladimir putin announced that the pipeline would be rerouted well away from the lake .
viktor kuznetsov , executive director of the association of minority peoples , has studied the impact of energy projects on the evenk people .
he says that since 2001 , the number of reindeer in the irkutsk region - on which the evenk economy depends - has diminished by 10 % .
he accuses energy companies of commissioning reports to boost their own credibility .
one report by the irkutsk-based institute of geography suggested that the evenk community need only be compensated for a loss of nine us dollars -lrb- 225 roubles ; £ 4.50 -rrb- per year - a sum mr kuznetsov says is laughably small compared with their actual losses .
he says the evenk are losing thousands of hectares of hunting grounds - home to numerous squirrels , elk and sable .

among the many highlights of the pre-budget report will be an update of the government 's borrowing forecasts for the next few years .
alas , the revisions to be made may not be in the most attractive direction .
so far this financial year , government borrowing has deteriorated , not improved .
tax revenues are coming in below expectations .
the missing money might come in later as the figures are always volatile and were very volatile last year .
but it seems that corporation tax in particular is not as lucrative as the treasury thought it would be .
cash shortage as a result the government is set to borrow about £ 5bn this year , on its " golden rule " measure of borrowing i.e. the amount it borrows in excess of the amount it invests in long term capital projects .
the economy has hitherto been strong not weak , so there is no obvious explanation for the shortage of cash .
now there 's no need to pour blame on to the treasury for getting it wrong this year .
they are only one or two per cent adrift on their revenue forecasts , and it 's hard to predict tax revenues more precisely than that at the best of times .
and they may still turn out to be right - we 're not even half way through the financial year .
stubborn borrowing but it does have to be said that in recent history the government 's forecasts have usually turned out to be too optimistic .
and there 's quite a bit of history to this which is worth re-visiting now , as we see the borrowing problem remain as stubborn as it is .
before the 2005 election , the government was warned that it was being too optimistic in its revenue forecasts ; not just by oddballs and opponents but by the consensus of credible expert opinion .
indeed , in january 2005 , the institute for fiscal studies -lrb- the most respected independent analysts of the public finances -rrb- published projections showing that unless the government changed policy by raising taxes or cutting spending , it would be borrowing £ 10bn this year -lrb- on the golden rule measure -rrb- .
two months later , gordon brown published projections showing a surplus of £ 4bn for this year .
in other words , there was a £ 14bn pound gap between the chancellor and the ifs .
tax rises since those projections were made in 2005 there have been four budgets or pre-budgets , which have between them announced tax rises raising £ 4bn this year .
so , if we do end up borrowing £ 5bn this year , the ifs will be seen to have been almost bang on back in 2005 , while the chancellor was overly-optimistic by about £ 13bn .
ironically , at the time the treasury said of its forecasts : " the use of cautious assumptions audited by the national audit office builds a safety margin into the public finance projections to guard against unexpected events " .
this was seen as incredible at the time , and with hindsight people were right to have viewed the use of the word " cautious " with scepticism .
borrowing in boom times however , a consequence of those overly optimistic treasury forecasts was that inadequate action was taken to sort out the borrowing problem , and the borrowing has persisted .
of course , deficits do n't always matter .
governments expect to run surpluses in the economically buoyant years and run deficits in the downturn years .
then the two average out over the cycle as a whole .
but we have been in deficit for the past six years and these do not feel like they have been sluggish .
observing strong corporate profits , the private equity boom , the way house prices have moved and consumer spending , it does n't feel as though we have been in years of famine with the feast about to start and with tax revenues now just starting to ready themselves to walk through the door of the exchequer .
if anything , with the credit crunch biting in the city , it feels as though the boom is coming to an end and normality is about to return .
that 's why forecasters universally think growth next year will be slower than this year .

among the many highlights of the pre-budget report will be an update of the government 's borrowing forecasts for the next few years .
alas , the revisions to be made may not be in the most attractive direction .
so far this financial year , government borrowing has deteriorated , not improved .
tax revenues are coming in below expectations .
the missing money might come in later as the figures are always volatile and were very volatile last year .
but it seems that corporation tax in particular is not as lucrative as the treasury thought it would be .
cash shortage as a result the government is set to borrow about £ 5bn this year , on its " golden rule " measure of borrowing i.e. the amount it borrows in excess of the amount it invests in long term capital projects .
the economy has hitherto been strong not weak , so there is no obvious explanation for the shortage of cash .
now there 's no need to pour blame on to the treasury for getting it wrong this year .
they are only one or two per cent adrift on their revenue forecasts , and it 's hard to predict tax revenues more precisely than that at the best of times .
and they may still turn out to be right - we 're not even half way through the financial year .
stubborn borrowing but it does have to be said that in recent history the government 's forecasts have usually turned out to be too optimistic .
and there 's quite a bit of history to this which is worth re-visiting now , as we see the borrowing problem remain as stubborn as it is .
before the 2005 election , the government was warned that it was being too optimistic in its revenue forecasts ; not just by oddballs and opponents but by the consensus of credible expert opinion .
indeed , in january 2005 , the institute for fiscal studies -lrb- the most respected independent analysts of the public finances -rrb- published projections showing that unless the government changed policy by raising taxes or cutting spending , it would be borrowing £ 10bn this year -lrb- on the golden rule measure -rrb- .
two months later , gordon brown published projections showing a surplus of £ 4bn for this year .
in other words , there was a £ 14bn pound gap between the chancellor and the ifs .
tax rises since those projections were made in 2005 there have been four budgets or pre-budgets , which have between them announced tax rises raising £ 4bn this year .
so , if we do end up borrowing £ 5bn this year , the ifs will be seen to have been almost bang on back in 2005 , while the chancellor was overly-optimistic by about £ 13bn .
ironically , at the time the treasury said of its forecasts : " the use of cautious assumptions audited by the national audit office builds a safety margin into the public finance projections to guard against unexpected events " .
this was seen as incredible at the time , and with hindsight people were right to have viewed the use of the word " cautious " with scepticism .
borrowing in boom times however , a consequence of those overly optimistic treasury forecasts was that inadequate action was taken to sort out the borrowing problem , and the borrowing has persisted .
of course , deficits do n't always matter .
governments expect to run surpluses in the economically buoyant years and run deficits in the downturn years .
then the two average out over the cycle as a whole .
but we have been in deficit for the past six years and these do not feel like they have been sluggish .
observing strong corporate profits , the private equity boom , the way house prices have moved and consumer spending , it does n't feel as though we have been in years of famine with the feast about to start and with tax revenues now just starting to ready themselves to walk through the door of the exchequer .
if anything , with the credit crunch biting in the city , it feels as though the boom is coming to an end and normality is about to return .
that 's why forecasters universally think growth next year will be slower than this year .
if the economy is in for a few slower years -lrb- and that is still a big " if " -rrb- , the new chancellor might wish his predecessor had sorted out the borrowing earlier on .

the comprehensive spending review will set out the government 's spending plans for the next three years and beyond .
here 's our guide to which areas of government can hope to throw a party , and which may need to go on a diet .
spending limits gordon brown has said that education is his " passion " but health is his " priority " .
yet both the nhs and schools can expect a smaller spending increase than in previous reviews .
that is because the government 's self-imposed rules on public spending impose a straitjacket on future increases .
having risen from 37.4 % of national income in 1999-2000 , spending will level off at a little over 42 % .
the graph shows the changes in public spending since the 1960s .
so who will do well from this comprehensive spending review ?
education we know for sure that schools will do better than average out of government spending increases , because the prime minister has already told us .
when he was chancellor , gordon brown said education spending in england would increase by 2.5 % a year in real terms between 2007/8 and 2010/11 .
health health has been the main beneficiary of previous labour government spending reviews and the pie-chart shows that it currently gets the biggest share of the cake after pensions & welfare benefits .
the nhs is still expected to do better than most other areas of government from the review , but the slowdown in the growth of health spending begins here .
since 2002 the service has experienced average annual real terms increases of more than 7 % .
this is expected to fall to between 3 % and 3.5 % in the years to 2011/12 .
from such a high base , in the nhs this will feel like a tough spending round .
it is also in sharp contrast to the recommendations of the wanless review published in 2002 .
it said that spending on the nhs should be boosted by 4.4 % a year over the five years from 2007/08 .
elsewhere , the institute for fiscal studies said the home office , the ministry of justice and nine other small departments will have to face a spending cut of 2.6 % a year , when inflation is taken into account .
" delivering these cuts without a detrimental impact on service quality in these areas will undoubtedly be difficult , " said carl emmerson of the institute for fiscal studies .
housing with many younger voters unable to get onto the housing ladder , housing has raced to the top of the political agenda .
in the housing green paper , the government pledged to help build at least 210,000 affordable homes through funding of housing associations .
the government has already said this will cost £ 8bn .
defence the defence budget has shrunk in comparison with the rest of the economy since the 1980s .
that trend is unlikely to change in this review .
expect defence expenditure to rise from £ 34bn in 2008-09 , to £ 35.3bn in 2009-10 and £ 36.9bn in 2010-11 .
this is a rise - but just 1.5 % above inflation .

here 's our guide to what the comprehensive spending review means for different government departments and for you .
what is a spending review ?
it is the government 's main tool for deciding how much money will go into schools , hospitals and other public services .
when he was chancellor , gordon brown decided to take a long term view and make these decisions every two to three years .
the first innovation of the comprehensive spending review is to move from the short-termism of the annual cycle and to draw up public expenditure plans not on a one year basis but on a three year basis .
gordon brown , 1998 previously public spending had been planned for a year ahead , and announced in the annual budget .
the new chancellor alistair darling will set out the government 's spending plans for the next three years : 2008/9 , 2009/10 , 2010/11 .
how does it work exactly ?
the treasury sets the overall limit for public spending .
it then allocates resources between departments , according to the government 's priorities .
the nhs did particularly well in the 2004 spending review these budgets are known as departmental expenditure limits -lrb- dels -rrb- .
it is then up to departments to decide how best to manage and distribute this spending within their own areas .
some spending can not be fixed in this way .
social security benefits , for example , can vary dramatically and are therefore managed in the budget and the pre-budget report .
but this is a " comprehensive " spending review .
does that make it different ?
yes , the comprehensive spending review could set the government 's strategy for the next decade .
in 1998 , the last csr said that health and education were to be priorities and they have received more money ever since .
future spending reviews were then used to outline the details of this strategy .
the treasury has said that this year 's review will carefully consider the impact of a number of long-term issues , among them : population change technological change tackling terrorism pressure on natural resources such as oil , comprehensive spending reviews also work from a zero base .
this means that that they ignore past spending plans and start from zero .
this could mean radical changes , with less money for low-priority departments .

learning through landscapes , a school grounds charity , believes boredom is behind the bullying .
a quarter of uk children say they have been bullied but that rises to 47 % in wales , according to the study by the royal bank of scotland and natwest .
it has led to calls for better playgrounds to help combat the problem .
as part of the banks ' research , a selection of primary school children and parents - 1,146 aged between six and 11 and 1,102 parents - across the uk were surveyed .
the results underline the concerns of learning through landscapes , a charity which helps schools make the most of their outdoor spaces for play and learning .
' stimulating play ' previous research conducted by the charity found that schools which improved their outdoor play spaces saw a 64 % reduction in bullying and a 73 % improvement in children 's attitudes towards learning .
the charity 's chief executive catherine andrews said : " children often engage with bullying or engage in negative behaviour because they are bored .
" a proven solution is to engage them in more stimulating play .
whilst it is said that children will play anywhere , the quality of the experience is undoubtedly related to the quality of the environment . "
the survey also revealed that 53 % of parents in wales who were questioned said their greatest fear is that their child will become a victim of bullying .

hilary benn , secretary of state for environment , food and rural affairs , said legislation would be introduced to tighten whisky definitions .
the new laws will strictly regulate the descriptions and geographical locations that can be used on whisky bottles .
the move was welcomed by the scotch whisky association , who said it would bring " significant benefits " .
mr benn said he would be consulting with the industry with a view to secondary uk legislation being introduced by spring 2008 . "
scotch whisky exports are worth over £ 2bn to the scottish economy each year and the industry needs this proposed legislation to help maintain that figure " des browne secretary of state for scotland he added : " this consultation exercise will take us another step closer to strengthening the uk legislation that the scotch whisky association have been telling us they need to help them protect scotch whisky in export markets .
" the proposed legislation will make special provisions relating to scotch whisky .
the proposals will define tightly the descriptions applied to scotch whisky .
" they will also tightly define its geographical provenance - such as highland or islay - and ensure that if the product uses the name of a distillery then it must also come from that distillery . "
des browne , the secretary of state for scotland , said : " this is another example of the uk government working in a reserved area to protect one of scotland 's most important exports " scotch whisky exports are worth over £ 2bn to the scottish economy each year and the industry needs this proposed legislation to help maintain that figure and defend its high-value product from imitation in some overseas markets . "
legal action under the proposed regulations , whisky will be strictly defined under one of five categories , single malt , single grain , blended , blended malt and blended grain .
distillers will also be allowed to attach one of five regional names - highland , lowland , speyside , campbeltown , islay - but will be barred from labelling whisky with the name of a distillery or a similar name if it is not a product of that distillery .
the scotch whisky association will be able to use the existence of the new uk legislation in legal action against overseas counterfeiters . "
these proposals will deliver significant benefits to the industry and the wider economy " gavin hewitt scotch whisky association the industry has regularly complained of scotch such as glen highland green and red scot being sold in countries like india and china .
the scotch whisky association said it can be fighting up to 70 court cases around the world at any one time against overseas manufacturers who use tartan designs or pictures of pipers on their packaging , or who give their whisky names which are supposed to sound scottish .
gavin hewitt , chief executive of the scotch whisky association , pointed out : " at a time when international demand for scotch is growing , distillers will applaud proposals to bring forward this important legislation .
" these proposals will deliver significant benefits to the industry and the wider economy , helping to protect , promote and grow scotch whisky globally .
" comprehensive and consolidated legislation will ensure scotch whisky has the best possible protection from unfair practices and that consumers can receive clear information about what they are buying . "
scottish enterprise minister jim mather said the scottish government had been working closely with the uk government and the whisky industry to protect scotch .
he added : " it is important to continue maximising the economic benefits of scotch whisky . "
