program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.09.2007 opinion : eu needs deeds not more words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president suggested forming a " council of wise men " to provide new perspectives on the eu during a meeting with the german chancellor near berlin on monday , but dw 's bernd riegert is skeptical . what do people do when they do n't know what to do ?
they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .

the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .

how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.09.2007 opinion : eu needs deeds not more words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president suggested forming a " council of wise men " to provide new perspectives on the eu during a meeting with the german chancellor near berlin on monday , but dw 's bernd riegert is skeptical . what do people do when they do n't know what to do ?
they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .

the colorful search is on germany 's next general election might still be two years away , but political parties have already begun looking for coalition partners to replace the current government .
some even go so far as to propose party mergers . boosted by the highest approval ratings for any german chancellor since world war ii , angela merkel on wednesday , sept .
12 , probably did n't find it too difficult to praise her predecessor . talking about the " great success story " of germany 's economic recovery during a parliamentary budget hearing , merkel gave credit to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 welfare reform program , which helped spark the current upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her cdu colleagues have every reason to be upbeat merkel 's conciliatory gesture towards her former rival might have been meant to comfort schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are now the junior coalition partner to the chancellor 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- : according to a new survey for german magazine stern , the spd has dropped to 25 percent , while 40 percent of voters say they would choose the cdu . while the next general election is n't scheduled to take place for another two years , all parties in parliament - with the exception of the ostracized left party - have openly begun to sound out potential coalition partners . getting cozy again on tuesday night , members of the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who were in a coalition government from 1982 to 1998 , met for a " joyful get-together , " as cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told reporters following the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 dream team ?
merkel and fdp leader guido westerwelle according to the stern poll , the cdu , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the fdp would get 48 percent of votes in an election , compared to just 46 percent for spd , greens and the left party . pofalla and his fdp counterpart , dirk niebel , said that the strategic meeting had helped to create a basis of trust between the dream coalition partners , adding that the group had discovered many similarities as far as economic , finance and family policy were concerned . greens leader reinhard bütikofer , whose party served in a coalition with the spd from 1998 until 2005 , called the meeting " parliamentary folklore . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be a revival of the spd-green coalition ?
" i think that 's a strange event that 's taking place there , " he told german public broadcaster deutschlandradio on wednesday . but bütikofer 's party colleagues do n't seem to think that it 's such a bad idea to get an early start on talks with potential allies for 2009 : young spd and green parliamentarians have arranged to meet for dinner on wednesday night . first jamaica , then gabon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jamaica coalition was an option after the 2005 election others are also rekindling talk about a possible coalition between conservatives , fdp and greens - nicknamed the jamaica coalition because the parties ' colors correspond to those in the flag of the caribbean nation . the latest suggestion for cooperation , however , comes from an fdp member , who has suggested that his party should merge with the greens . " the great project of a political center in germany - the establishment of a sustainable liberalism , the merger of fdp and greens , could be launched in 2009 , " jorge chatzimarkakis , a european parliamentarian , told stern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabon 's national flag is green , yellow and blue chatzimarkakis , who is a member of the fdp 's national leadership , said that many people in both parties already agree on a wide range of issues .
he added that the new party could get between 15 and 20 percent of votes and represent the reunification of the fdp 's blue-yellow " old middle classes " with the greens " new middle classes .

he is currently head of the federal financial monitoring service .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they include a 20-year-old man , his 21-year-old wife and another man of 26 . the online video , aired in march this year , showed a masked speaker urging austria and germany to cease their support of the united states in afghanistan . the speaker said austria , reliant on tourism for an important part of its revenue , would be damaged if it were targeted by militants , and asked why germany would risk its economic interests to help us president george w. bush . austria had four military officers in afghanistan at the time the video was posted .

on tuesday , the islamic jihad union , a group affiliated to al qaeda and with roots in uzbekistan , claimed responsibility for the foiled plot . platter said he was not aware of any links between the german and the austrian suspects , but said surveillance had produced evidence the austrians had contacts to al qaeda . " the technical -lsb- surveillance -rsb- measures of the last months have shown that the persons were in touch with the terror network al qaeda , " he said , but he declined to elaborate on how or with whom contact had been made . terrorism the main challenge to europe in a sign that europeans are increasingly nervous about their vulnerability to terrorism , a recent survey by the german marshall fund of the united states showed a sharp increase in the number of germans who fear international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are increasingly worried about terrorism the survey said that 70 percent of germans felt they might suffer a terror attack , a 32 percent increase over 2005 .
that brings the fear of terror among germans close to the level of fear among americans , which stood at 74 percent in a similar survey .
on wednesday , a report by the london-based international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- gave further cause for concern . the growth of international terrorism will remain one of the main challenges for 2008 after the recent discovery of terrorism plots in europe , the report said .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture .

12 , that the trio suspected of producing the video had confessed to having links to al qaeda .
the video demanded german and austrian soldiers leave afghanistan . the three , however , had not established an independent terrorist cell , and at no time was austria directly in danger , he added . " austria was not under threat of an attack at any time , " platter told a news conference .
" we could determine that based on the actions of the three . " video relates to afghanistan mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian interior minister güther platter said there were no concrete threats against austria the three , who were under covert police surveillance for months , were arrested by anti-terror forces in vienna .
all of them are second-generation austrian citizens with arab origins .
they include a 20-year-old man , his 21-year-old wife and another man of 26 . the online video , aired in march this year , showed a masked speaker urging austria and germany to cease their support of the united states in afghanistan . the speaker said austria , reliant on tourism for an important part of its revenue , would be damaged if it were targeted by militants , and asked why germany would risk its economic interests to help us president george w. bush . austria had four military officers in afghanistan at the time the video was posted .

on tuesday , the islamic jihad union , a group affiliated to al qaeda and with roots in uzbekistan , claimed responsibility for the foiled plot . platter said he was not aware of any links between the german and the austrian suspects , but said surveillance had produced evidence the austrians had contacts to al qaeda . " the technical -lsb- surveillance -rsb- measures of the last months have shown that the persons were in touch with the terror network al qaeda , " he said , but he declined to elaborate on how or with whom contact had been made . terrorism the main challenge to europe in a sign that europeans are increasingly nervous about their vulnerability to terrorism , a recent survey by the german marshall fund of the united states showed a sharp increase in the number of germans who fear international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are increasingly worried about terrorism the survey said that 70 percent of germans felt they might suffer a terror attack , a 32 percent increase over 2005 .
that brings the fear of terror among germans close to the level of fear among americans , which stood at 74 percent in a similar survey .
on wednesday , a report by the london-based international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- gave further cause for concern . the growth of international terrorism will remain one of the main challenges for 2008 after the recent discovery of terrorism plots in europe , the report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.09.2007 opinion : eu needs deeds not more words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president suggested forming a " council of wise men " to provide new perspectives on the eu during a meeting with the german chancellor near berlin on monday , but dw 's bernd riegert is skeptical . what do people do when they do n't know what to do ?
they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

the video demanded german and austrian soldiers leave afghanistan . the three , however , had not established an independent terrorist cell , and at no time was austria directly in danger , he added . " austria was not under threat of an attack at any time , " platter told a news conference .
" we could determine that based on the actions of the three . " video relates to afghanistan mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian interior minister güther platter said there were no concrete threats against austria the three , who were under covert police surveillance for months , were arrested by anti-terror forces in vienna .
all of them are second-generation austrian citizens with arab origins .
they include a 20-year-old man , his 21-year-old wife and another man of 26 . the online video , aired in march this year , showed a masked speaker urging austria and germany to cease their support of the united states in afghanistan . the speaker said austria , reliant on tourism for an important part of its revenue , would be damaged if it were targeted by militants , and asked why germany would risk its economic interests to help us president george w. bush . austria had four military officers in afghanistan at the time the video was posted .

on tuesday , the islamic jihad union , a group affiliated to al qaeda and with roots in uzbekistan , claimed responsibility for the foiled plot . platter said he was not aware of any links between the german and the austrian suspects , but said surveillance had produced evidence the austrians had contacts to al qaeda . " the technical -lsb- surveillance -rsb- measures of the last months have shown that the persons were in touch with the terror network al qaeda , " he said , but he declined to elaborate on how or with whom contact had been made . terrorism the main challenge to europe in a sign that europeans are increasingly nervous about their vulnerability to terrorism , a recent survey by the german marshall fund of the united states showed a sharp increase in the number of germans who fear international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are increasingly worried about terrorism the survey said that 70 percent of germans felt they might suffer a terror attack , a 32 percent increase over 2005 .
that brings the fear of terror among germans close to the level of fear among americans , which stood at 74 percent in a similar survey .
on wednesday , a report by the london-based international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- gave further cause for concern . the growth of international terrorism will remain one of the main challenges for 2008 after the recent discovery of terrorism plots in europe , the report said .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.09.2007 opinion : eu needs deeds not more words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president suggested forming a " council of wise men " to provide new perspectives on the eu during a meeting with the german chancellor near berlin on monday , but dw 's bernd riegert is skeptical . what do people do when they do n't know what to do ?
they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.09.2007 opinion : eu needs deeds not more words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president suggested forming a " council of wise men " to provide new perspectives on the eu during a meeting with the german chancellor near berlin on monday , but dw 's bernd riegert is skeptical . what do people do when they do n't know what to do ?
they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .

" we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

they seek out advice .
that goes both for private individuals and for businesses , which hire consultancy firms .
it is also a long established practice in politics .
numerous commissions of experts advise ministries and parliaments during the legislative process . what is new is that leading politicians are clearly at a loss when it comes to the future of the european union .
how else can you explain the fact that the french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a " council of wise men " to decide on such questions as to how far the eu should expand and upon what basis .
german chancellor angela merkel has given her support to the proposal , but she probably did it with gritted teeth , as a favor to nicolas sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert just a few weeks ago when germany was still holder of the eu presidency , the german chancellor made clear that what was needed was action rather than yet more consultation , ideas and draft papers .
europe 's leading politicians have managed to talk around the question of where the frontiers of europe lie .
and now wise men and women without political office or mandate should , of all people , take over this task ?
this is a political decision for democratically elected heads of government .
the last huge consultation project involving the eu went badly wrong .
lessons should be learned from that .
in the end , no one took any notice of the european convention .
this was composed of a lot of wise people from europe who got together to create a european constitution .
the constitution failed .
what remains of it , which is now in circulation as a new mini-treaty , could end up going the same way because of opposition from poland and britain .
the best of advice is useless if the politicians are not prepared to listen and to act upon it . neither the french president , who exudes self-confidence , nor the german chancellor , who tends to pragmatism , give the impression that they would like to listen to the advice of eminent experts whose names have not yet been revealed . there is something else lurking behind all of this .
mr. sarkozy made this proposal in a foreign policy speech because he wants to keep his election promise of stopping turkey from becoming a full eu member .
sarkozy expects the advisers to make a proposal along those lines in 2009 , the year of the european elections . the german chancellor has agreed because sarkozy has threatened to block all further negotiations with turkey and to be obstructive in foreign policy issues , if he does n't get his " council of wise men . "
this was basically a case of barely concealed political blackmail . a feeling of helplessness is spreading among the foreign ministers of the eu member states .
they did n't really get anywhere during their meeting in portugal .
the 27 eu members could not reach consensus about the constitution or the controversial question of kosovo 's future status .
but this is not because of a lack of wisdom or resolution .
it is mainly down to the fact that some governments lack the political will to live out european solidarity and community . the eu commission and diplomats in brussels are extremely skeptical about the call for a " council of wise men . "
how should this body be made up and what should its mandate be ?
who should choose its members and who is meant to formulate its tasks ? the heads of state and government should be wise enough to see the folly of sarkozy 's and merkel 's request and tell them : we can shape the future of europe ourselves .

controversially , 9/11 was chosen as the date to sign the " european declaration for tolerance . "
it aims to draw attention to what the former muslims see as the lack of freedom of religion within islam . former muslims from several european countries signed the declaration in the hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the united states tuesday .
other signatories included many well-known dutch politicians , authors and journalists . the date of the declaration , sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links islam to terrorism . the ex-muslim committees from the netherlands , britain , germany and the scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within islamic culture . " ex-muslim , ehsan jami , an iranian-born dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the declaration of tolerance .
jami , 22 , a labour party member of the city council in a district near the hague , has been attacked for his views three times . " there are five sharia schools in islam which say if you leave islam you must be killed , " jami , 22 , told reuters in an interview . muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some muslim countries . ex-muslims reignite divisive debate over islam the movement of muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by jami and mina ahadi , an iranian living in germany , has reignited a divisive debate about islam and has put the lives of such self-declared " ex-muslims " in danger .
in germany , ahadi also lives under heavy police protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi , head of german committee of ex-muslims , which has 400 members in highly publicized interviews , jami 's blunt attacks on islam has offended many dutch muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right-wing politician geert wilders , who has called for complete ban of the quran . jami has referred to the muslim prophet mohammed as " criminal , " compared islam to fascism and nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the islamic faith . divided support for ex-muslim group initially , the labour party did not support jami and his committee , and the dutch vice-prime minister wouter bos told the news daily volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends muslims and their faith . " but the dutch public rallied around jami , putting pressure on jacques tichelaar , labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-muslim committee . however , han noten , who is the dutch senate 's labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance . in a commentary for wednesday 's nrc handelsbad newspaper , he said the committee of ex-muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . " " signing the declaration on september 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " noten added .
" it suggests … that former muslims are innocent and muslims are guilty . " the right to renounce the islamic faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh , a filmmaker who criticized islam was murdered in amsterdam in 2004 jami 's " committee of ex-muslims " wants imams and muslims to recognize fellow muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith . " we are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by jami , ahadi of the german chapter , and their british counterpart maryam namazie , who is also of iranian origin . ahadi , who belongs to the german group called " wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " we have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the islamic republic firsthand . there are some 400 committee members in germany , including non-muslim germans , according to ahadi .
the british council of ex-muslims has around 70 members , and jami 's committee has only two official members . " we have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " jami told the afp news agency .

israel has repeatedly refused to comment but us officials said israeli fighters had carried out an attack on an unspecified target .

israel has repeatedly refused to comment but us officials said israeli fighters had carried out an attack on an unspecified target .
mr jaafari said the planes had come under syrian anti-aircraft fire .
" they were fleeing and in order to speed up the planes they dropped the munitions , " he said , quoted by the associated press news agency .

we are exerting efforts so that we do n't fall into this trap . " he added .

the government 's transport advisors think so .
the commission for integrated transport argues that emissions from cars and lorries still outweigh by some way those from air travel , though aviation is growing as a source of carbon dioxide .
one remedy , the authors conclude in a report published on wednesday , is for us drivers to have state-sponsored lessons in eco-motoring , an idea that would cost the government little but benefit the planet a lot .
the theory is that the way you drive can be as important as what you drive , and how much you drive it .
smooth driving by way of an experiment , we went to the ford test track at dunton in essex , to break the speed limit .
drive at 80mph on a motorway and it is claimed your car will pump out significantly more carbon dioxide than at 70 .
see how carbon emissions vary with speed with a technician plugged into the car 's engine via a laptop , i drove a series of laps , maintaining 70 and then 80 on the two straightest sections .
the result ?
the car produced a third more co2 getting from one end of the track to the other at 80 than it did at 70 . "
our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year " andy taylor , sustainability director for ford but there 's more .
research suggests turning on the air conditioning uses 10 % more fuel , therefore producing co2 .
unfortunately keeping cool by lowering your car windows also increases fuel consumption , as does keeping the roof rack on after that family holiday .
most of all , driving smoothly is the key to an environmentally-friendly motoring life .
gentle on the accelerator , thinking ahead , judging the distance to the lights , and stopping without a jolt .
ford 's director of sustainability andy taylor says : " our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year .
" that will save around up to £ 200 a year , helping your wallet , but also making a material difference to the planet .
at the end of the day for the vast majority of people , it 's about the money . "
however , the commission for integrated transport -lrb- cfit -rrb- wants action from companies like ford as well as its customers .
by 2020 , its report says , all cars should produce no more than 100g of co2 per kilometre .
in other words , they 'll all have to be roughly as green as the greenest production cars are now .
flight taxes aviation does n't escape either .
emissions trading - which forces airlines and airports to buy the right to produce co2 - is a must , the report concludes .
and the government should be actively finding ways to make flying more expensive .
cfit quotes a new mori poll which suggests a growing number of air travellers accept the idea of higher taxes .
the commission 's strategy is to find ways for the government to get more environmental bang for its buck .
it has predicted the measures would increase by 70 % the co2 savings proposed by the government 's climate change programme .
in other words , the report says , the current plan to stabilise carbon emissions by 2020 would become one to reduce emissions by around 14 % .
but the findings make clear there is a need for action at all levels - from the government , from companies , and from us , sitting at the wheel of our cars .

the government 's transport advisors think so .
the commission for integrated transport argues that emissions from cars and lorries still outweigh by some way those from air travel , though aviation is growing as a source of carbon dioxide .
one remedy , the authors conclude in a report published on wednesday , is for us drivers to have state-sponsored lessons in eco-motoring , an idea that would cost the government little but benefit the planet a lot .
the theory is that the way you drive can be as important as what you drive , and how much you drive it .

see how carbon emissions vary with speed with a technician plugged into the car 's engine via a laptop , i drove a series of laps , maintaining 70 and then 80 on the two straightest sections .
the result ?
the car produced a third more co2 getting from one end of the track to the other at 80 than it did at 70 .
our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year andy taylor , sustainability director for ford but there 's more .
research suggests turning on the air conditioning uses 10 % more fuel , therefore producing co2 .
unfortunately keeping cool by lowering your car windows also increases fuel consumption , as does keeping the roof rack on after that family holiday .
most of all , driving smoothly is the key to an environmentally-friendly motoring life .

ford 's director of sustainability andy taylor says : " our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year .
" that will save around up to £ 200 a year , helping your wallet , but also making a material difference to the planet .
at the end of the day for the vast majority of people , it 's about the money . "
however , the commission for integrated transport -lrb- cfit -rrb- wants action from companies like ford as well as its customers .

the government 's transport advisors think so .
the commission for integrated transport argues that emissions from cars and lorries still outweigh by some way those from air travel , though aviation is growing as a source of carbon dioxide .
one remedy , the authors conclude in a report published on wednesday , is for us drivers to have state-sponsored lessons in eco-motoring , an idea that would cost the government little but benefit the planet a lot .
the theory is that the way you drive can be as important as what you drive , and how much you drive it .
smooth driving by way of an experiment , we went to the ford test track at dunton in essex , to break the speed limit .
drive at 80mph on a motorway and it is claimed your car will pump out significantly more carbon dioxide than at 70 .
see how carbon emissions vary with speed with a technician plugged into the car 's engine via a laptop , i drove a series of laps , maintaining 70 and then 80 on the two straightest sections .
the result ?
the car produced a third more co2 getting from one end of the track to the other at 80 than it did at 70 .
our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year andy taylor , sustainability director for ford but there 's more .
research suggests turning on the air conditioning uses 10 % more fuel , therefore producing co2 .
unfortunately keeping cool by lowering your car windows also increases fuel consumption , as does keeping the roof rack on after that family holiday .
most of all , driving smoothly is the key to an environmentally-friendly motoring life .
gentle on the accelerator , thinking ahead , judging the distance to the lights , and stopping without a jolt .
ford 's director of sustainability andy taylor says : " our own analysis indicates that a driver can save around 25 % of fuel consumption in a year .
" that will save around up to £ 200 a year , helping your wallet , but also making a material difference to the planet .
at the end of the day for the vast majority of people , it 's about the money . "
however , the commission for integrated transport -lrb- cfit -rrb- wants action from companies like ford as well as its customers .
by 2020 , its report says , all cars should produce no more than 100g of co2 per kilometre .
in other words , they 'll all have to be roughly as green as the greenest production cars are now .
flight taxes aviation does n't escape either .
emissions trading - which forces airlines and airports to buy the right to produce co2 - is a must , the report concludes .
and the government should be actively finding ways to make flying more expensive .
cfit quotes a new mori poll which suggests a growing number of air travellers accept the idea of higher taxes .
the commission 's strategy is to find ways for the government to get more environmental bang for its buck .
it has predicted the measures would increase by 70 % the co2 savings proposed by the government 's climate change programme .
in other words , the report says , the current plan to stabilise carbon emissions by 2020 would become one to reduce emissions by around 14 % .
but the findings make clear there is a need for action at all levels - from the government , from companies , and from us , sitting at the wheel of our cars .

he was seen as a man in predecessor junichiro koizumi 's image - telegenic , outspoken and with a similar popular appeal to voters .
in the early days of his premiership he scored a number of political hits , achieving a high-level rapprochement with china and winning local support with a tough line on north korea .
but a series of scandals and gaffes - both by him and his ministers - harmed the government , and his approval ratings fell dramatically .
a heavy loss for his ruling liberal democratic party in upper house elections in july 2007 provided one of the catalyst for his decision to resign .
sex slaves a conservative , mr abe pushed for a more assertive foreign policy and a greater role for japan on the world stage .
under his administration , a bill passed setting out steps for holding a referendum on revising the country 's pacifist constitution .
mr abe wants more prominence for japan in the international arena he staked his job on pushing through legislation extending japan 's controversial mission in support of us-led operations in afghanistan in the face of fierce opposition in parliament .
in his resignation announcement , mr abe said he felt it would be easier to extend the mandate under a new leader .
during his tenure , mr abe also called for a greater sense of national pride and backed a law requiring the teaching of patriotism in schools .
" it has always been my conviction that children who are imparted with such a sense of values will grow up to be citizens who have ambitions , " he said in december 2006 .
but despite supporting his predecessor 's visits to the controversial yasukuni shrine - which is seen by japan 's neighbours as a symbol of the country 's past militarism - he did not visit it himself during his period in office , prioritising regional ties .
however , he provoked anger in china and south korea when he said there was no evidence that women were forced to become sex slaves by the japanese army during world war ii .
he was forced to clarify his remarks and went on to issue an apology in parliament .
voter concern mr abe also struggled to contend with a series of ministerial gaffes and resignations .
his health minister drew criticism in january when he referred to women as " birth-giving machines " .
a scandal-hit farm minister committed suicide in may and his defence minister resigned over controversial comments about the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
but most damaging to mr abe was the revelation that over the years the government lost pension records affecting about 50m claims .
mr abe pledged to shake up the department responsible for the mistakes and to sort out the mess by early next year .
but the issue worried and angered voters , many of whom started to question his leadership skills .
ruling elite born in nagato , yamaguchi prefecture , mr abe is a member of a high-profile political family .
he is the son of shintaro abe , a former foreign minister , and grandson of former prime minister nobusuke kishi , who was arrested as a suspected war criminal after world war ii but never charged .
mr abe graduated in political science from seikei university before studying politics at the university of southern california .
his first job on returning to japan was at kobe steel , before winning his first seat in parliament in 1993 .
he went on to become deputy cabinet secretary , and then secretary-general of the ruling liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- in 2003 .
he was appointed to the cabinet for the first time in october 2005 and given the high-profile role of chief cabinet secretary - a promotion seen as a sign that he was being groomed for the top leadership .

the bbc 's james rodgers in moscow examines the enduring influence of the secret police in the era of president vladimir putin - himself a former kgb officer .
communist-era secret police became hate figures across much of the soviet bloc during the cold war .
when those regimes unravelled in the late 1980s and early 1990s , people celebrated their demise .
archives were opened , informers were exposed , former dissidents became presidents .
but in russia , things turned out differently .
after a decade of unpredictable change - in which jobs , savings , and many of the certainties which had come with communism simply disappeared - russians looked for another solution .
in march 2000 , they turned not to a dissident writer or activist .
they elected a former kgb officer to lead the country .
as he prepares to leave office next spring , vladimir putin enjoys popularity ratings his predecessors could never have dreamed of .
his kgb past has proved no obstacle to widespread support among the population .
soviet iron fist the secret police under one name or another were a hugely influential force in russia throughout the soviet period . "
working in intelligence you need to be informed about a lot of things and you need to be able to work with people and respect your partners " president vladimir putin they began as the " cheka " - from the russian letters standing for " extraordinary commission " .
in that incarnation , they gave the russian language the word " chekist " .
the ties of loyalty which agents develop are supposed to last for life .
as the saying goes , " there 's no such thing as a former chekist " .
kgb veterans may add : " there are only traitors " .
many of mr putin 's former fellow officers have prospered during his tenure .
they are known in russian today as the siloviki .
the name comes from the russian word sila , meaning " strength " or " power " .
privileged elite in soviet times , those who joined the kgb 's ranks were in a position of privilege .
they were considered reliable enough to see and hear things which the soviet regime kept from the majority of the population .
foreign travel was a rare opportunity .
it gave those lucky enough to get it an experience denied to their follow citizens .
they gained an understanding of the world as it really was , not just as it appeared in the soviet media .
they served under the guise of diplomats , journalists and members of trade delegations .
top-quality language tuition had equipped them for intelligence-gathering .
their varied experience and extensive contacts gave them the qualities they needed to find their way through the chaos and uncertainty of russia in its immediate post-soviet years .
not only have they survived , they have succeeded .
kgb agents , and those from the kgb 's main successor agency , the fsb -lrb- federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti , or state security service -rrb- , are among those making millions from russia 's economic boom .
" former kgb officers and current fsb officers are increasing their influence in the oil and gas industries , " says mikhail krutikhin , of rusenergia .
mr krutikhin 's years as a foreign correspondent for the tass news agency brought him into frequent contact with soviet intelligence officers .
he sees the hand of their successors in russia 's richest industries , which he now follows as an analyst .
" russian companies have ' curators ' assigned to them , " he explains .
" they make requests and demands for information on foreign clients . "
shadowy careers mr putin himself has spoken proudly of his past in the kgb , suggesting that the experience has helped him as head of state .
many of those now occupying positions of power in the kremlin , and in the top levels of russian business - the two often overlap - are believed to have been kgb agents .
their official biographies rarely spell it out , but gaps in individual cvs , or foreign postings during soviet times , strongly suggest it .
olga kryshtanovskaya , of the russian academy of sciences , has studied the country 's centres of power since the late 1980s .
this is what she sees today .
" a quarter of the political elite are siloviki , " she says .
her definition includes not only the kgb , but also the military and other security forces .
that 's only the ones who publicly admit to it .
it is not in the nature of many secret policemen to disclose their identity .
ms kryshtanovskaya estimates that when those she describes as " affiliated " - that is , not publicly declared - are taken into account , the figure could be as high as three-quarters .
one of those who makes no secret of his kgb past is sergei ivanov .
" i am proud of it , " he told the bbc 's hardtalk programme last year .
mr ivanov is currently one of russia 's first deputy prime ministers .
he is frequently spoken of as a likely successor to mr putin .
the siloviki look set to stay strong .

the bbc 's james rodgers in moscow examines the enduring influence of the secret police in the era of president vladimir putin - himself a former kgb officer .
dzerzhinsky set up a secret police force that once terrorised russia communist-era secret police became hate figures across much of the soviet bloc during the cold war .
when those regimes unravelled in the late 1980s and early 1990s , people celebrated their demise .
archives were opened , informers were exposed , former dissidents became presidents .
but in russia , things turned out differently .
after a decade of unpredictable change - in which jobs , savings , and many of the certainties which had come with communism simply disappeared - russians looked for another solution .
in march 2000 , they turned not to a dissident writer or activist .
they elected a former kgb officer to lead the country .
as he prepares to leave office next spring , vladimir putin enjoys popularity ratings his predecessors could never have dreamed of .
his kgb past has proved no obstacle to widespread support among the population .
soviet iron fist the secret police under one name or another were a hugely influential force in russia throughout the soviet period .
working in intelligence you need to be informed about a lot of things and you need to be able to work with people and respect your partners president vladimir putin they began as the " cheka " - from the russian letters standing for " extraordinary commission " .
in that incarnation , they gave the russian language the word " chekist " .
the ties of loyalty which agents develop are supposed to last for life .
as the saying goes , " there 's no such thing as a former chekist " .
kgb veterans may add : " there are only traitors " .
many of mr putin 's former fellow officers have prospered during his tenure .
they are known in russian today as the siloviki .
the name comes from the russian word sila , meaning " strength " or " power " .
privileged elite in soviet times , those who joined the kgb 's ranks were in a position of privilege .
they were considered reliable enough to see and hear things which the soviet regime kept from the majority of the population .
mr ivanov and mr putin , both ex-kgb , are close associates foreign travel was a rare opportunity .
it gave those lucky enough to get it an experience denied to their follow citizens .
they gained an understanding of the world as it really was , not just as it appeared in the soviet media .
they served under the guise of diplomats , journalists and members of trade delegations .
top-quality language tuition had equipped them for intelligence-gathering .
their varied experience and extensive contacts gave them the qualities they needed to find their way through the chaos and uncertainty of russia in its immediate post-soviet years .
not only have they survived , they have succeeded .
kgb agents , and those from the kgb 's main successor agency , the fsb -lrb- federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti , or state security service -rrb- , are among those making millions from russia 's economic boom .
" former kgb officers and current fsb officers are increasing their influence in the oil and gas industries , " says mikhail krutikhin , of rusenergia .

dzerzhinsky set up a secret police force that once terrorised russia communist-era secret police became hate figures across much of the soviet bloc during the cold war .
when those regimes unravelled in the late 1980s and early 1990s , people celebrated their demise .
archives were opened , informers were exposed , former dissidents became presidents .
but in russia , things turned out differently .
after a decade of unpredictable change - in which jobs , savings , and many of the certainties which had come with communism simply disappeared - russians looked for another solution .
in march 2000 , they turned not to a dissident writer or activist .
they elected a former kgb officer to lead the country .
as he prepares to leave office next spring , vladimir putin enjoys popularity ratings his predecessors could never have dreamed of .
his kgb past has proved no obstacle to widespread support among the population .
soviet iron fist the secret police under one name or another were a hugely influential force in russia throughout the soviet period .
working in intelligence you need to be informed about a lot of things and you need to be able to work with people and respect your partners president vladimir putin they began as the " cheka " - from the russian letters standing for " extraordinary commission " .
in that incarnation , they gave the russian language the word " chekist " .
the ties of loyalty which agents develop are supposed to last for life .
as the saying goes , " there 's no such thing as a former chekist " .
kgb veterans may add : " there are only traitors " .
many of mr putin 's former fellow officers have prospered during his tenure .
they are known in russian today as the siloviki .
the name comes from the russian word sila , meaning " strength " or " power " .
privileged elite in soviet times , those who joined the kgb 's ranks were in a position of privilege .
they were considered reliable enough to see and hear things which the soviet regime kept from the majority of the population .
mr ivanov and mr putin , both ex-kgb , are close associates foreign travel was a rare opportunity .
it gave those lucky enough to get it an experience denied to their follow citizens .
they gained an understanding of the world as it really was , not just as it appeared in the soviet media .
they served under the guise of diplomats , journalists and members of trade delegations .
top-quality language tuition had equipped them for intelligence-gathering .
their varied experience and extensive contacts gave them the qualities they needed to find their way through the chaos and uncertainty of russia in its immediate post-soviet years .
not only have they survived , they have succeeded .
kgb agents , and those from the kgb 's main successor agency , the fsb -lrb- federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti , or state security service -rrb- , are among those making millions from russia 's economic boom .
" former kgb officers and current fsb officers are increasing their influence in the oil and gas industries , " says mikhail krutikhin , of rusenergia .
mr krutikhin 's years as a foreign correspondent for the tass news agency brought him into frequent contact with soviet intelligence officers .
he sees the hand of their successors in russia 's richest industries , which he now follows as an analyst .
" russian companies have ' curators ' assigned to them , " he explains .
" they make requests and demands for information on foreign clients . "
shadowy careers mr putin himself has spoken proudly of his past in the kgb , suggesting that the experience has helped him as head of state .
many of those now occupying positions of power in the kremlin , and in the top levels of russian business - the two often overlap - are believed to have been kgb agents .
their official biographies rarely spell it out , but gaps in individual cvs , or foreign postings during soviet times , strongly suggest it .
olga kryshtanovskaya , of the russian academy of sciences , has studied the country 's centres of power since the late 1980s .
this is what she sees today .
" a quarter of the political elite are siloviki , " she says .
her definition includes not only the kgb , but also the military and other security forces .
that 's only the ones who publicly admit to it .
it is not in the nature of many secret policemen to disclose their identity .
ms kryshtanovskaya estimates that when those she describes as " affiliated " - that is , not publicly declared - are taken into account , the figure could be as high as three-quarters .
one of those who makes no secret of his kgb past is sergei ivanov .
" i am proud of it , " he told the bbc 's hardtalk programme last year .
mr ivanov is currently one of russia 's first deputy prime ministers .
he is frequently spoken of as a likely successor to mr putin .
the siloviki look set to stay strong .

the dup mayor maurice bradley seconded a motion put forward by sdlp councillor john dallat .
several dup councillors were among those who voted in favour of the motion .
environment minister arlene foster said she had been " minded " to accept a plan by private developer seymour sweeney .
on tuesday , sinn fein called for the dup to clarify its relationship with the millionaire developer .
mr sweeney has said he is a member of the dup and had signed nomination papers for a party councillor but never gave " a penny piece " to the party .
it has also emerged that ian paisley jnr bought a house in bushmills at full market value from mr sweeney .
seymour sweeney said he had not given the dup money ms foster said it was " rubbish " to suggest that she was influenced by mr sweeney 's membership of the dup .
" i do not know the applicant , have never met him , and know nothing about him .
" if anyone impugns my integrity in this matter i will be seeking legal advice and will act accordingly , " she said basalt the managing director of seaport ltd said he had never met ms foster or nigel dodds , the economy minister who has dropped plans to spend £ 21m of public money on the centre .
he said he has met dup leader ian paisley who is the mp in his area of north antrim and ian paisley jnr who is an mla for the area .
north antrim sinn fein mla daithi mckay had called on the dup to clarify their relationship with the developer .
earlier , chairman of the causeway coast and glen heritage trust dr david irwin said the backing for a privately-funded centre was " almost certain to provoke a judicial review " .
the causeway attracts nearly 500,000 visitors a year .
the previous visitors ' centre on the site burned down in april 2000 .
renowned for its polygonal columns of layered basalt - resulting from a volcanic eruption 60 million years ago - it is the only world heritage site in northern ireland .

local traffic police concluded at the time that mr ortega caused the accident by making an illegal u-turn .
lohan and a passenger sustained minor injuries .
on tuesday , superior court judge michael l stern rejected a motion that argued that mr ortega 's legal action lacked legal sufficiency .
a trial was set for 7 april 2008 .

lohan , 21 , is being sued by van driver raymundo ortega , whose lawyer claims he was knocked out during the crash .
mr ortega claims the star was fleeing photographers and was drink-driving .
local traffic police concluded at the time that mr ortega caused the accident by making an illegal u-turn .
lohan and a passenger sustained minor injuries .
on tuesday , superior court judge michael l stern rejected a motion that argued that mr ortega 's legal action lacked legal sufficiency .
a trial was set for 7 april 2008 .
" this case is about responsibility and she 's not taking responsibility , " mr ortega 's lawyer , robert g klein , said outside court in los angeles .
lohan 's party lifestyle has been well documented in the press mr ortega is seeking at least $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 100,000 -rrb- in damages .
lohan 's lawyer , david j ozeran , said there was no evidence that the mean girls star was intoxicated .
after the incident , police in los angeles said the paparazzi were not to blame for the car crash .
" it appears it 's the van 's fault for making an illegal u-turn , " a police spokesman was quoted as saying .
he added that no drink or drugs were involved in the crash .
jail time last month , lohan was ordered to spend one day in jail after pleading guilty to drink-driving and drug charges as part of a plea bargain stemming from arrests earlier this year in beverly hills and santa monica .
she was put on three years ' probation , and must complete community service and a drug treatment programme .
the actress crashed her car in los angeles in may and was arrested again in july after being stopped by police .
in a statement , lohan said : " it is clear to me that my life has become completely unmanageable because i am addicted to alcohol and drugs .
deputy district attorney danette meyers said after the hearing in august that if lohan was convicted of any further drink-driving charges in the future , she would have to spend a mandatory four months in jail .
lohan , whose most recent film - i know who killed me - was critically slammed , has spent several stints in rehab this year .
