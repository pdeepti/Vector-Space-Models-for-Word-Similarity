" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recent success in preventing terror shows how well positioned we are with current laws and the potential they offer , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i recommend deliberateness and a very careful check in regard to new ideas . " terrorism not a personal threat the emnid survey found that 25 percent of the population felt personally threatened by islamist terrorism , against 73 percent who did not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants to know who is buying large amounts of potential bomb ingredients justice minister brigitte zypries called sunday for germany to register the names of people buying chemicals that could be used in building bombs .
the three arrested terror suspects had collected a large amount of hydrogen peroxide , which when concentrated enough and mixed with other chemicals can become explosive . " the fact that the chemicals in the case of the three arrested suspects could be freely bought without registering the purchaser is , i think , not particularly fortunate , " she told deutschlandfunk radio on sunday . police need muslims ' assistance german commentators have noted with concern that two of those arrested on tuesday in connection with a massive bomb conspiracy aimed at us citizens in germany were german converts to islam . sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung referred to a " changed quality of terrorism " in its editorial . the paper noted that it was " necessary to distinguish islam and islamism , " yet it warned this remained difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just under half of germans want their troops to leave afghanistan in interviews sunday , zypries and schäuble both said they expected muslims to notify police if they were aware of violent radicals in their religious communities . germans split on afghanistan mission though germany refused to become involved in the us-led war in iraq , there has been widespread concern that the deployment of some 3,000 german troops to afghanistan was turning the country into a target for islamist terrorists . almost half of germans - 49 percent - backed withdrawing german troops and police , while 43 percent wanted the stabilization mission to continue .

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory .

" we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .

many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty .

" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .

the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady . " " parties not unimportant " despite the bleak outlook , neither of the political scientists predicted the end of political parties . " without parties , the german political system is unimaginable , " niedermayer said .
" they will always have a place in germany .
people have been talking about a crisis in german political parties for decades , but they are still there . "
detterbeck agreed : " there is a change in how parties act .
but they are not unimportant . " stefan dietrich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 malta , the european union 's smallest member , is to introduce the euro in january 2008 .
but , not everyone on the tiny island between italy and tunisia is pleased with the change in currency . while maltese is the national language on malta , english is widely used and also an official language for the tiny island nation and former british colony .
many students from other european countries , especially spain and france , travel to malta to improve their english during the summer holidays .
they also happen to be one of the biggest sources of income to the nation . but , before they begin their standard two-week language classes , they have to exchange their money from euros to maltese lira .
many tourists find it aggravating , especially after having become accustomed to traveling throughout europe using the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful malta attracts many tourists each year gillian de gaetano , who runs one of the language schools on the island , said she is overjoyed about the introduction of the euro in january .
it will save her a great deal of paperwork , and a lot of money , such as the exchange fees she must pay when parents transfer euros for their kids ' language course fees . once the euro is introduced , de gaetano said she also hopes to be able to sell more leisure activity packages to tourists . tourism is a huge source of income tourism is the most important economic branch on the island with britons and germans composing the largest groups in a total of over million tourists each year .
tourists ' tastes are also becoming more refined . malta is increasingly becoming a stop for luxury cruise liners , and more and more high-class hotels are cropping up across the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yachts abound in this marina near the capital valletta both tourists and natives can already become accustomed to the euro on the island .
since june of this year , prices of goods must be listed in both lira and euros . with malta located only 120 kilometers -lrb- 74.5 miles -rrb- from sicily , the people on the island could observe how italian business owners used the switch to the euro in 2002 to jack up the prices of their products . but maltese business owners now want to reassure island inhabitants that the same wo n't happen on their island . in the capital valletta 's busy republic street , shops windows display blue and green signs marked with the word " fair " - meaning that prices are not supposed to increase when the currency changes . hopes for an economic boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republic street is a busy shopping area in addition to the tourism industry , trade is also important for the island .
peter darley , managing director of vgt , the largest shipping company at grand harbour in valletta , said that the euro will not change his business much . however , he does anticipate that prices of everyday goods will increase . " the government is trying to control that , " darley said .
" in the long term , the euro will be good for malta . " like darley , many of the maltese people hope joining the euro zone will stimulate their economy . they envision profiting from the switch since , right now , they earn only around one-fifth of what average eu citizens do each year . bildunterschrift : collectors will be able to add malta 's euro coins to their sets in january grit hofmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .

but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .

economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament .

" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady .

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control .

" the eu is a secular institution .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves religion -pipe- 09.09.2007 most european nations keep god out of constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god will not be mentioned in the eu 's new reform treaty the preamble to the eu 's reform treaty will not mention god .
yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .

" christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control .

there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .

the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .

but , not everyone on the tiny island between italy and tunisia is pleased with the change in currency . while maltese is the national language on malta , english is widely used and also an official language for the tiny island nation and former british colony .
many students from other european countries , especially spain and france , travel to malta to improve their english during the summer holidays .
they also happen to be one of the biggest sources of income to the nation . but , before they begin their standard two-week language classes , they have to exchange their money from euros to maltese lira .

it will save her a great deal of paperwork , and a lot of money , such as the exchange fees she must pay when parents transfer euros for their kids ' language course fees . once the euro is introduced , de gaetano said she also hopes to be able to sell more leisure activity packages to tourists . tourism is a huge source of income tourism is the most important economic branch on the island with britons and germans composing the largest groups in a total of over million tourists each year .

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .

for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .

young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process .

economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves religion -pipe- 09.09.2007 most european nations keep god out of constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god will not be mentioned in the eu 's new reform treaty the preamble to the eu 's reform treaty will not mention god .
yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .

" we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady . " " parties not unimportant " despite the bleak outlook , neither of the political scientists predicted the end of political parties . " without parties , the german political system is unimaginable , " niedermayer said .
" they will always have a place in germany .
people have been talking about a crisis in german political parties for decades , but they are still there . "
detterbeck agreed : " there is a change in how parties act .

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady . " " parties not unimportant " despite the bleak outlook , neither of the political scientists predicted the end of political parties . " without parties , the german political system is unimaginable , " niedermayer said .
" they will always have a place in germany .
people have been talking about a crisis in german political parties for decades , but they are still there . "

but , not everyone on the tiny island between italy and tunisia is pleased with the change in currency . while maltese is the national language on malta , english is widely used and also an official language for the tiny island nation and former british colony .

it will save her a great deal of paperwork , and a lot of money , such as the exchange fees she must pay when parents transfer euros for their kids ' language course fees . once the euro is introduced , de gaetano said she also hopes to be able to sell more leisure activity packages to tourists . tourism is a huge source of income tourism is the most important economic branch on the island with britons and germans composing the largest groups in a total of over million tourists each year .
tourists ' tastes are also becoming more refined . malta is increasingly becoming a stop for luxury cruise liners , and more and more high-class hotels are cropping up across the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yachts abound in this marina near the capital valletta both tourists and natives can already become accustomed to the euro on the island .

" in the long term , the euro will be good for malta .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics german parties begin early search for future partners germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role politics -pipe- 09.09.2007 germany 's political parties in crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main political parties are going through a rough time aging supporters , falling membership , a shrinking voting base : germany 's established political parties have serious problems .
some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady . " " parties not unimportant " despite the bleak outlook , neither of the political scientists predicted the end of political parties . " without parties , the german political system is unimaginable , " niedermayer said .
" they will always have a place in germany .
people have been talking about a crisis in german political parties for decades , but they are still there . "
detterbeck agreed : " there is a change in how parties act .
but they are not unimportant . " stefan dietrich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some commentators are even calling the situation a systemic crisis . germany 's main political parties are running out of steam .
this became evident by mid-august , at the very latest , when the country 's " grand coalition " partners asked for an additional 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- from state coffers . the idea was quickly shelved amid heated opposition .
but the discussion exposed deeply rooted problems in the country 's main political parties .
for years , contributions have been falling , alongside membership rolls . competition from social movements political scientists chalk up the woes of germany 's political parties in part to social changes that are going on throughout western europe .
for instance , the parties have met with competition from new social movements , said oskar niedermayer , spokesman for the party research working group at the german political science association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two attac activists protesting against the g8 summit in germany in june this year " anyone who wanted to be politically active in the 1950s had to be in a political party , " said niedermayer .
" today he could go to attac , for example . " attac is an international network of activists working for the democratic control of financial institutions ; they protest about , and are active on , issues from globalization to public services .
young people , in particular , prefer to take their political engagement in a form that is short-term and project-oriented , niedermayer said .
in addition , labor unions and churches - the classic recruiting grounds for party membership - are also suffering membership losses and can no longer be counted on to produce new members , niedermayer said .
" leisure time is also different today , " he said .
" people no longer need to look to the parties for ideas and for information . " complex decision-making process according to klaus detterbeck , a party researcher in at the magdeburg university , the party system itself is undergoing a fundamental change - one that ultimately alienates members . the parties ' planks are mostly developed by professional politicians , in the parliamentary parties or in party committees , said detterbeck , adding that " the general membership is rarely brought into the decision-making process . " this development is unlikely to change , because of the highly complex decision-making processes involved in setting party policy , according to detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party conference of angela merkel 's christian democrats " it is unimaginable that an average citizen can come up with ideas about energy policy in his free time , " detterbeck said . unfortunately , he added , this means the parties have lost their appeal for the average voter as the policies become more difficult to understand . niedermayer pointed out that , despite the apparently grim outlook , not all parties are actually losing membership .
small parties with a more unified membership do n't seem to have many problems .
it is mostly the big parties - the ones trying to answer to the diverse needs of various interest groups - that are suffering , he said . germany 's spd the worst hit germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is the worst affected , niedermayer said , adding that the problem is n't a new one .
economic transition , the dwindling working class and new social and labor-market reforms have hit the spd much harder than other parties , niedermayer said . in addition , the spd has faced challenges from parties further left on the political spectrum - first by the green party and more recently by the newly formed left party , which is a result of a merger between a group of disgruntled former spd members and the pds , the successor to the east german communist party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is facing bleak times " in the long-term , the spd has to live with the left party , " said niedermayer . though the left party has drawn several new voters since it was founded this year , the expert warned of overestimating its appeal .
he , however , said the party would probably continue to be represented in parliament , in eastern german states and also in some western ones , where it is traditionally weaker . detterbeck said the situation was comparable to those in some other european countries . " in scandinavia , too , parties have established themselves left of the social democrats , " he said .
" they are partly relatively populist , but that 's enough to stay in parliament . " " no golden age in the future " the fact remains that all parties have trouble finding fresh blood . niedermayer pointed out that many were offering incentives , dismantling barriers and creating new chances to counter membership drain .
for instance , some are initiating party elections where all members have a say , lowering restrictions for party membership and trying to entice new members through projects or web sites . " that all works a bit , but it 's not going to draw hundreds of thousands of new members , " niedermayer said .
" i 'm not predicting a golden age for the future .
the parties have to do everything they can to keep their membership rolls steady . " " parties not unimportant " despite the bleak outlook , neither of the political scientists predicted the end of political parties . " without parties , the german political system is unimaginable , " niedermayer said .

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .
" the constellation in our group is now outstanding .
we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals . " germany are not in euro 2008 qualifying action on wednesday , playing a friendly against romania instead , while the czech republic entertain ireland , and slovakia are up against wales . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves religion -pipe- 09.09.2007 most european nations keep god out of constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god will not be mentioned in the eu 's new reform treaty the preamble to the eu 's reform treaty will not mention god .
yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .

many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty .

german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together .

however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .

the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was important to get three points here , " said klose , who won the 2006 world cup golden boot .
" we 're the clear table leaders and have to keep playing the way we have been . " after eight from 12 games , germany are on 22 points from a possible 24 , with the czech republic on 17 and ireland on 14 .
wales have seven points . " i am absolutely satisfied with the result because we have often had difficulties here , " said germany soccer coach joachim löw .

we have taken a big step with this victory . " experience sparse in german team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack was just one of the tested players missing from löw 's roster germany were in charge from the start and went in front when thomas hitzlsperger won a tackle in midfield and klose was fed by kevin kuranyi to score with the outside of his right foot . however the absence of key players in midfield including michael ballack , torsten frings and bernd schneider showed in the first half , with german possession rarely leading to danger in front of the welsh goal . bastian schweinsteiger , given a central midfield role , was busy throughout the match and at times seemed overwhelmed out of his typical spot on the left side . " we played a good match , but could have scored a few more goals , " said schweini , who came closest to upping the german total when he shaved the crossbar with a shot in the second half . löw : germany in position for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are well on their way to qualifying for the european championships but wales were limited going forward and vague hopes of retaliation were dashed when klose notched his second goal with 30 minutes left to play , brining his international tally up to 35 . wales defender gareth bale was dispossessed on the right by roberto hilpert and the stuttgart midfielder had time to find klose with a cross which the bayern munich striker gratefully headed into the net . " after this win we can be more relaxed ahead of the matches in october in ireland and against the czech republic , " löw said .
" i think we are in a position to reach the european finals .

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves religion -pipe- 09.09.2007 most european nations keep god out of constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god will not be mentioned in the eu 's new reform treaty the preamble to the eu 's reform treaty will not mention god .
yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet germany 's major churches would have preferred a reference , they told dw-world.de. most eu members do not include god in their national constitutions . only five of the 27 european union member states ' constitutions include the word " god " in their texts .
among them is germany 's , in which the preamble states : " conscious of their responsibility before god and man , animated by this will -lsb- … -rsb- , the german people have adopted , by virtue of their constituent power , this basic law . " according to the german protestant church , such wording would have fit well into the eu 's new constitutional treaty .
nikolaus schneider , head of the protestant church for germany 's rhineland region , called the phrase referring to the responsibility before god and man " a benchmark . " " it would not have been a problem for muslims , and even those who do n't believe in god would be able to find a point of reference through the double mentioning of god and man , " schneider said .
" we can not underestimate how important points of reference are for people and the state 's development . " christian-democrats suggested a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations differ on exactly how to separate church and state the irish , danish and greek constitutions endorsed a so-called " nominatio dei , " or reference to god .
many german christian-democrats considered the preamble of the 1997 polish constitution a good compromise for the eu treaty . " we - the polish nation - that is both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith , but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources -lsb- … -rsb- , " the preamble states . poland has been strongly shaped by catholicism .
german catholics have also long advocated a reference to god in the eu treaty . " for us , the reference to god has a central meaning , " said huber tintelott , speaker for the central committee of german catholics .
" incorporating god into the preamble -lsb- of the eu treaty -rsb- would have made it clear that humans must not be free to do whatever they can , and that there are rules that lie above the human level , which make it easier for people to live together . " another suggestion by european christian-democrats for the eu treaty 's preamble has been a reference to a european collective cultural heritage " based on the greek-roman philosophy , the christian message and jewish-christian values . " no god does not mean no church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion will be kept separate from state affairs though only five european constitutions include the word " god , " this does not mean that religion does not appear in the other country 's constitutions .
beyond the preamble , germany 's constitution mentions " religious communities . " in some european constitutions , those communities are named , which puts them in a better position than those who are not directly mentioned . " all religious commitments are equal before the law , " says article 8 of the italian constitution .
however , it also says that " denominations differing from catholic confessions have a right to organize their own statutes , as long as they do not go against the italian legal system . " the preamble of the spanish constitution from 1987 does not mention a single word about religion .
yet , the third paragraph of article 16 says " there is no state religion . " " the public authority respects the religious views of spanish society and maintains the respective cooperative relationships to the catholic church and other confessions , " the spanish constitution reads . france is an example of pure laicism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one fifth of the eu member states included the word " god " in their constitutions the french constitution is an example of absolute laicism , a political system which excludes any ecclesiastical influence or control . " freedom , equality and brotherliness " represent the collective ideal of the french people .
there is no god involved in the preamble of the statute .
the first article explains that " france is an undividable , secular , democratic and social republic . " " why should there be a reference to god in the preamble of the eu treaty ? " said rudolf ladwig of the international league of non-religious and atheists .
" the eu is a secular institution .
it should be neutral in its world-view .
those who do not have a religious world-view should feel at home in the eu .
in that respect , no religious terminology should be put upon them .
any worldly treaty is secular . " german muslims disappointed by treaty compromise one secular country knocking on europe 's door is turkey .
the preamble of their constitution says that , " holy religious sentiments , as the principle of secularism demands , should in no way be mixed with the affairs and politics of the state . " however , islam plays a very important role in turkish society .
secularism in turkey is different than in france .
it is not about the absolute separation of church and state , but about state control of religion .
to make this clear , article 136 of the turkish constitution added the committee for religious affairs . " turkey also likes to see that religion has a place in the constitution , " said aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany .
he said german muslims were disappointed that christians , despite their strong lobby in europe , did not manage to push through a reference to god in the eu treaty . " there are very different systems in europe and it would be too narrow an approach to say that we can not accept god in our constitution because france has a secular system , " mazyek said .
" in the german constitution , we included the recognition of a being that created everything , without any secularity or laicism . " luna bolivar -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

specialist officers will be in vehicles on match days in blaenau gwent and caerphilly county .
wales face canada in the first of the pool games on sunday and will go on to meet australia , japan and fiji .
gwent police said a similar scheme during the six nations tournament had proved a success .

he said the previous campaign had shown that " early intervention is key " .
' alcohol ' he said : " on match days domestic violence incidents peaked earlier in the day , around 8pm , whilst on non-match days such incidents heightened around 11pm - midnight .
" such initiatives have proven successful when run previously , at specific times of the year , when it 's anticipated there will be an increase in factors that can sometimes lead to domestic abuse , such as alcohol and debt . "
the assembly-funded wales domestic abuse helpline said one in four women in wales would be a victim of domestic abuse by their partner or ex-partner at some time in their life .
the helpline 's tracey owens said : " although our calls do not rise significantly on the days when there are big sporting events , this does not mean that domestic abuse incidents are not on the increase during this time , when there is a likelihood of increased alcohol consumption .
" although i would point out that alcohol is by no means an excuse for domestic abuse , if there are already issues within a domestic relationship then they can be exacerbated with alcohol . "
the helpline , aimed at men , women or children suffering domestic abuse , was launched in 2004 .
it is now a 24-hour operation and received 13,500 calls in the 12 months to april this year .

at last week 's meeting there were , on my count , 21 actual heads of central banks - from ben bernanke of the federal reserve to the governors or presidents of the banks of jordan , poland , south africa , israel , jordan , turkey , argentina and a host of others .
understated these are people who , for the most part , thrive on public silence .
mr bernanke 's media appearances were heavily orchestrated mr bernanke 's appearances outside the seclusion of the seminars were orchestrated to a fine degree .
he appeared clutching a mug of coffee on the terrace over-looking one of the most magnificent views on the planet , that of the teton mountains and snake river in the national park .
but all around him the citizenry were un-moved , talking rather of whether that 's an elk they can see in the distance .
and that , no doubt , is the way it should be .
market turmoil we do n't want to impose regulations that would be harmful to the economy ed lazear council of economic advisers overshadowing this year 's meeting was the turmoil roiling the world 's stock markets - turmoil which has been emanating from the american housing market .
loans to people who could n't repay them got bundled together and bought by banks right around the world , at an ultimate cost that nobody can yet calculate .
the jackson hole meeting is not a decision-making forum .
academic papers are presented and then discussed .
no formal conclusions are arrived at , but the general drive of feeling can be ascertained .
most people that i spoke to there believed the turmoil can be contained and is already being doused down , though without absolute certainty that serious repercussions may yet be felt .
the main worry now is that falling house prices in the united states will dampen consumer spending .
as mr bernanke told the symposium : " further tightening of credit conditions , if sustained , would increase the risk that the current weakness in housing could be deeper or more prolonged than previously expected . " '
and he indicated that the fed might lower interest rates to prevent falling house prices rebounding across the wider economy by depressing spending .
rescue moves martin feldstein , the president of the national bureau of economic research and the main economic advisor to ronald reagan , wants the federal reserve to lower interest rates : " housing prices are beginning to fall .
" a lot experts think they 're going to fall further .
if that happens , household wealth declines and people respond to that by spending less .
so i think the fed has to ease to bring us out of this . "
ed lazear , who chairs president bush 's council of economic advisers , told me that " mistakes that were made in terms of regulation " .
but he added that governments have to be careful when they respond with new regulation : " when you make changes that are very significant , they tend to be blunt instruments and they tend to do more harm than they do good .
we do n't want to impose regulations that would be harmful to the economy . "
resilience according to him , the aim should be to increase transparency to ensure that borrowers know what they 're signing up for .
" there are always abuses in markets .
there are always mistakes in markets , but markets are better now rather than worse .
people are better informed .
there 's more information available .
mr bernanke hinted at a rates cut to promote ' financial stability ' " i do n't think there 's anything that comes out of this that questions the value of capitalism , in fact quite the reverse .
the ability of economies to adjust to this in such a robust fashion is really testament to the strength of capitalism .
" if you look at the us over the past five or six years , we 've had some very major shocks in terms of the dot.com bust , in terms of 9/11 , in terms of corporate scandal .
we had a significant recession .
and yet if you look at this and you look at this economic period and we led the developed world in terms of growth rates and in terms of economic performance .
" i think it suggest that the robustness that 's been built into the system by the kind of flexibility that we have in our economy is probably something that should be mimicked by other countries , " said mr lazear .
one feeling did seem to be prevalent , and that was that regulation of the way in which mortgages were sold was inadequate .
rakesh mohan , deputy governor of the reserve bank of india , told me that the events in the united states had confirmed the view in india that a cautious approach was the way forward .
the general view among the bankers and economists at jackson hole was that the crisis could be contained by sensible measures - assuming collapsing american home prices do n't make people slam their wallets shut .

are the us banks themselves now running out of money ? "
stephen evans they seem oblivious of the men - usually men - who really do have power over their livelihoods .
at last week 's meeting there were , on my count , 21 actual heads of central banks - from ben bernanke of the federal reserve to the governors or presidents of the banks of jordan , poland , south africa , israel , jordan , turkey , argentina and a host of others .
understated these are people who , for the most part , thrive on public silence .
mr bernanke 's appearances outside the seclusion of the seminars were orchestrated to a fine degree .
he appeared clutching a mug of coffee on the terrace over-looking one of the most magnificent views on the planet , that of the teton mountains and snake river in the national park .
but all around him the citizenry were un-moved , talking rather of whether that 's an elk they can see in the distance .
and that , no doubt , is the way it should be .
market turmoil " we do n't want to impose regulations that would be harmful to the economy " ed lazear council of economic advisers overshadowing this year 's meeting was the turmoil roiling the world 's stock markets - turmoil which has been emanating from the american housing market .
loans to people who could n't repay them got bundled together and bought by banks right around the world , at an ultimate cost that nobody can yet calculate .
the jackson hole meeting is not a decision-making forum .
academic papers are presented and then discussed .
no formal conclusions are arrived at , but the general drive of feeling can be ascertained .
most people that i spoke to there believed the turmoil can be contained and is already being doused down , though without absolute certainty that serious repercussions may yet be felt .
the main worry now is that falling house prices in the united states will dampen consumer spending .
as mr bernanke told the symposium : " further tightening of credit conditions , if sustained , would increase the risk that the current weakness in housing could be deeper or more prolonged than previously expected . " '
and he indicated that the fed might lower interest rates to prevent falling house prices rebounding across the wider economy by depressing spending .
rescue moves martin feldstein , the president of the national bureau of economic research and the main economic advisor to ronald reagan , wants the federal reserve to lower interest rates : " housing prices are beginning to fall .
" a lot experts think they 're going to fall further .
if that happens , household wealth declines and people respond to that by spending less .
so i think the fed has to ease to bring us out of this . "
ed lazear , who chairs president bush 's council of economic advisers , told me that " mistakes that were made in terms of regulation " .
but he added that governments have to be careful when they respond with new regulation : " when you make changes that are very significant , they tend to be blunt instruments and they tend to do more harm than they do good .
we do n't want to impose regulations that would be harmful to the economy . "
resilience according to him , the aim should be to increase transparency to ensure that borrowers know what they 're signing up for .
" there are always abuses in markets .
there are always mistakes in markets , but markets are better now rather than worse .
people are better informed .
there 's more information available .
" i do n't think there 's anything that comes out of this that questions the value of capitalism , in fact quite the reverse .
the ability of economies to adjust to this in such a robust fashion is really testament to the strength of capitalism .
" if you look at the us over the past five or six years , we 've had some very major shocks in terms of the dot.com bust , in terms of 9/11 , in terms of corporate scandal .
we had a significant recession .
and yet if you look at this and you look at this economic period and we led the developed world in terms of growth rates and in terms of economic performance .
" i think it suggest that the robustness that 's been built into the system by the kind of flexibility that we have in our economy is probably something that should be mimicked by other countries , " said mr lazear .
one feeling did seem to be prevalent , and that was that regulation of the way in which mortgages were sold was inadequate .
rakesh mohan , deputy governor of the reserve bank of india , told me that the events in the united states had confirmed the view in india that a cautious approach was the way forward .
the general view among the bankers and economists at jackson hole was that the crisis could be contained by sensible measures - assuming collapsing american home prices do n't make people slam their wallets shut .
stephen evans 's two special programmes about the us sub-prime credit woes will be broadcast on radio 4 at 2100 bst on sunday , 9 september .
