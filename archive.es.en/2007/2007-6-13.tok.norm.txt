but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .

the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .
rather , he sees it as a case of " art as field study .

but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said .

" we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .

it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .

meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .

but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.06.2007 eu countries reject call for hosting illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta , spain and italy are on the front lines when it comes to illegal immigrants from africa the eu says it wants to save the lives of african migrants desperate to reach its shores but struggled to find ways to help frontline state malta handle the problem . european union countries on tuesday brushed off maltese calls for creating a system to take in illegal immigrants picked up outside eu territory , but vowed to boost border patrols and strengthen cooperation with transit countries .
while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de malta appeals for eu help to confront immigrant wave maltese interior minister tonio borg called on his european union counterparts to help his country deal with a wave of illegal migrants trying to reach europe .
-lrb- 12.06.2007 -rrb- eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved .
-lrb- 11.06.2007 -rrb- spain gets rich on cheap immigrant labor many illegal immigrants undertake perilous trips to reach europe .
but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region .

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "

the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence . " friis said he now intended to hold the conference in denmark later this year . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 13.06.2007 german state corruption scandal takes first victim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's corruption scandal appears to involve the police a widening corruption scandal in the german state of saxony has put pressure on chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff , and cost the head of the state 's intelligence service his job . a growing scandal involving organized crime , child prostitution and illegal real estate deals has taken its first government victim in the eastern german state of saxony . more and more reports are coming out almost on a daily basis about high-ranking saxon justice and police officials in leipzig having teamed up with organized crime rings .
child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .
the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .
" this is not a recent phenomenon .
on the contrary , such structures have been in place in saxony since the early 1990s - that is since right after german unification . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .

but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .

the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed .

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .
rather , he sees it as a case of " art as field study .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .

the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed .

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .
the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .
" this is not a recent phenomenon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence . " friis said he now intended to hold the conference in denmark later this year . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .
the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .
" this is not a recent phenomenon .
on the contrary , such structures have been in place in saxony since the early 1990s - that is since right after german unification . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cycling 's image in germany has been rocked by several high-profile doping admissions from cyclists competing for the former telekom team , now renamed team t-mobile .
team t-mobile will compete under that name in the tour , which starts in london on july 7 .
although the german broadcasters are eager to keep hold of the money and run t-mobile advertising , a spokesman for the telecommunications giants said they want the money to go into more stringent drug testing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich no longer with t-mobile " we understand ard and zdf 's position , but we would appreciate it if the money was n't spent on additional advertising , " said a t-mobile spokesman .
michael vesper , the president of the german olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , welcomed telekom 's proposal .
" i would be glad if the public broadcasters take up t-mobile 's good suggestion , " he said .
doping scandals the telekom team name has been dragged through the mud recently .
denmark 's bjarne riis was stripped of his 1996 tour de france victory recently after the former telekom cyclist admitted he took performance-enhancing drugs during the race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling has been tainted with numerous doping scandals t-mobile has decided not to select their ukrainian time trial specialist serhiy honchar for next month 's tour de france following a suspicious blood test last month .
plus , one of germany 's top cycling stars erik zabel admitted last month he had taken banned blood-boosting drug epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- in 1996 while competing for telekom . ullrich 's woes controversy also surrounds 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
a " soigneur " who worked with the telekom team said he injected ullrich with the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , although ullrich denies the accusations . german magazine sport-bild has revealed details of an e-mail from a friend of ullrich 's to merkel which invited the german chancellor to his lake constance home to help the 33-year-old " rehabilitate his reputation . " but government spokesman thomas steg is quoted in wednesday 's edition of sport-bild stating that " a meeting between the chancellor and jan ullrich is not considered appropriate . " ullrich , who won the 1997 tour de france , retired in february having been sacked by team t-mobile last july after he was linked , along with dozens of other riders , to the spanish doping investigation dubbed " operation puerto " which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence .

bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses .

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .
the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .
" this is not a recent phenomenon .
on the contrary , such structures have been in place in saxony since the early 1990s - that is since right after german unification . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed .

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .

many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .

billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .

the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence .

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence . " friis said he now intended to hold the conference in denmark later this year . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .
there are more than 90 network operators here and around 300 services suppliers .
if they do n't consolidate , small companies will find it hard to survive , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is europe 's largest telecommunications operator deutsche telekom acquired the austrian mobile operator telering in 2006 and is currently planning to buy orange 's dutch business . contrary to persistent rumours , the german giant has no plans to pull out of the united states , obermann continued . " t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions . " the break-up ideas overlook the fact that the group creates substantial synergies via its manifold internal links , " he said . " but if we do n't succeed in pushing through our planned reforms , then we 'll have to look at such scenarios .

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .
rather , he sees it as a case of " art as field study .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .

cycling 's image in germany has been rocked by several high-profile doping admissions from cyclists competing for the former telekom team , now renamed team t-mobile .
team t-mobile will compete under that name in the tour , which starts in london on july 7 .
although the german broadcasters are eager to keep hold of the money and run t-mobile advertising , a spokesman for the telecommunications giants said they want the money to go into more stringent drug testing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich no longer with t-mobile " we understand ard and zdf 's position , but we would appreciate it if the money was n't spent on additional advertising , " said a t-mobile spokesman .
michael vesper , the president of the german olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , welcomed telekom 's proposal .
" i would be glad if the public broadcasters take up t-mobile 's good suggestion , " he said .

plus , one of germany 's top cycling stars erik zabel admitted last month he had taken banned blood-boosting drug epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- in 1996 while competing for telekom . ullrich 's woes controversy also surrounds 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
a " soigneur " who worked with the telekom team said he injected ullrich with the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , although ullrich denies the accusations . german magazine sport-bild has revealed details of an e-mail from a friend of ullrich 's to merkel which invited the german chancellor to his lake constance home to help the 33-year-old " rehabilitate his reputation . " but government spokesman thomas steg is quoted in wednesday 's edition of sport-bild stating that " a meeting between the chancellor and jan ullrich is not considered appropriate . " ullrich , who won the 1997 tour de france , retired in february having been sacked by team t-mobile last july after he was linked , along with dozens of other riders , to the spanish doping investigation dubbed " operation puerto " which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.06.2007 eu countries reject call for hosting illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta , spain and italy are on the front lines when it comes to illegal immigrants from africa the eu says it wants to save the lives of african migrants desperate to reach its shores but struggled to find ways to help frontline state malta handle the problem . european union countries on tuesday brushed off maltese calls for creating a system to take in illegal immigrants picked up outside eu territory , but vowed to boost border patrols and strengthen cooperation with transit countries .
while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fight against climate change and the advancement of renewable energies must become central tasks for the world bank , " wiezoreck-zeul said after meeting with zoellick in berlin . wieczorek-zeul , who was one of the leading voices calling for previous world bank president paul wolfowitz to stand down , praised zoellick for his international experience and negotiating talent . " i am certain that he fulfills all the requirements for the post of world bank president , " wieczorek-zeul said . the veteran trade negotiator , who previously served in the us state department , was nominated two weeks ago to replace fellow american wolfowitz , who resigned after weeks of uproar over the generous pay and promotions package he arranged for his girlfriend , shaha riza . zoellick said he was confident he can overcome the " period of turmoil " caused by the scandal surrounding the bank 's former head . " there is no doubt that the institution has been through a period of turmoil and i think that one of the tasks of a new president will be to try to calm the waters , " zoellick said . " i think the best way to do that , to start , is by tapping the incredible expertise and knowledge and perspective on some of the issues . " making africa a priority wiezoreck-zeul also urged zoellick to make africa a priority if , as is widely expected , he is elected to the top job at the development institution . pressure groups have criticized the $ 60-billion -lrb- 45-billion-euro -rrb- pledge to fight disease in africa announced at last week 's group of eight summit in germany as insufficient and proof that the world 's richest nations were failing the poor because most of the money had already been included in earlier pledges . but zoellick said that after a day of discussions with officials in berlin , " i came away with the sense that there has certainly been no lessening of the commitment to african development on the part of europe . " " there is a very strong interest in europe about african development , " he added . listen and learn on visits to south africa and ghana in recent days he had wanted to " listen and learn " and had been struck by the ability and vision of many of africa 's leaders , he said . zoellick also urged trade chiefs to try to find a solution in the doha round of talks on breaking down barriers to world trade . ministers from four key trading powers - brazil , the european union , india and the united states - are due to meet in the german city of potsdam next week to try to kickstart the stalled five-year-old round of talks . a breakthrough would be " extraordinarily important for the world economy , for development , for growth , for creating opportunities , " zoellick said . " i believe there is a deal that can be put together and it involves the elimination of agricultural export subsidies ... that distort trade , something that heavily involves the us , europe but some others , canada and japan . " berlin was zoellick 's last stop on a trip to several european union countries .

cycling 's image in germany has been rocked by several high-profile doping admissions from cyclists competing for the former telekom team , now renamed team t-mobile .
team t-mobile will compete under that name in the tour , which starts in london on july 7 .
although the german broadcasters are eager to keep hold of the money and run t-mobile advertising , a spokesman for the telecommunications giants said they want the money to go into more stringent drug testing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich no longer with t-mobile " we understand ard and zdf 's position , but we would appreciate it if the money was n't spent on additional advertising , " said a t-mobile spokesman .
michael vesper , the president of the german olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , welcomed telekom 's proposal .
" i would be glad if the public broadcasters take up t-mobile 's good suggestion , " he said .

plus , one of germany 's top cycling stars erik zabel admitted last month he had taken banned blood-boosting drug epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- in 1996 while competing for telekom . ullrich 's woes controversy also surrounds 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
a " soigneur " who worked with the telekom team said he injected ullrich with the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , although ullrich denies the accusations . german magazine sport-bild has revealed details of an e-mail from a friend of ullrich 's to merkel which invited the german chancellor to his lake constance home to help the 33-year-old " rehabilitate his reputation . " but government spokesman thomas steg is quoted in wednesday 's edition of sport-bild stating that " a meeting between the chancellor and jan ullrich is not considered appropriate . " ullrich , who won the 1997 tour de france , retired in february having been sacked by team t-mobile last july after he was linked , along with dozens of other riders , to the spanish doping investigation dubbed " operation puerto " which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .
they are also hoping for a positive reaction when the unesco committee responsible for endangered world heritage sites meets from june 23 to july 2 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .

not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .

" de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .
should the new acquisitions fail to perform , he may well regret not investing in a classic playmaker and another big man at the back . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .

now , one town here is going to host 1,001 visitors from beijing .
but do n't call them tourists - they 're art . popular beijing avant-garde artist ai weiwei is a star in the burgeoning chinese contemporary art firmament .
his ability to make a stir - even in the jaded world of conceptual art - has been proven time and again . talk of the art world now " fairytale , " the piece he is presenting at the 12th " documenta " exhibit in kassel , germany , has once again made him the talk of the art world . for the artwork , ai has arranged sending 1,001 chinese people from all walks of life - street vendors , farmers , police officers , students , engineers - to the town of kassel for the duration of the show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bunks in dormitories , where the 1,001 guests will sleep the people will live in dormitories there and have no specific duties except to wander around kassel , although ai has said he hopes they will not all stick together .
the only stipulation is that the visitors , who began arriving tuesday evening , can not leave the town . at a cost of 3.1 million euros -lrb- $ 4.14 million -rrb- , " fairytale " takes the prize as the most expensive project of this year 's show .
documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .

documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .
rather , he sees it as a case of " art as field study .

but the union is continuing its strike it started five weeks ago . the german service workers union ver.di said that some 13,000 workers were staging strikes even as the talks started .
ado wilhelm , a union official leading the strike effort , said that the number of striking workers would be reduced significantly on friday at the earliest " we 'll first wait to see how the negotiations go , " wilhelm told the ap news agency . the union authorized the strike on may 10 after talks collapsed over deutsche telekom 's plans to relocate thousands of workers to a new t-services operation - with a cut in pay and longer hours , but also a guarantee against layoffs . bildunterschrift : strikes may continue through friday bonn-based deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecommunications company . ver.di said on tuesday it would return to talks after deutsche telekom personnel chief thomas sattelberger offered a new proposal , calling for bonuses that might help offset the planned pay cuts . " we welcome the return to the negotiating table , " andreas middel , a spokesman for telekom , told ap . he said the company had always stressed that it was prepared to compromise on elements of its restructuring concept . slowing expansion telekom has also said it is is putting the brakes on its overseas expansion plans and has no plans to develop in emerging markets for the moment , chief executive rene obermann said in an interivew wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief rene obermann even though obermann had said in march that he saw acquisitions abroad as a chance to return to growth , the ceo told the business daily handelsblatt in its wednesday edition that deutsche telekom had other priorities at the moment . " for the time being , we 'll boost our presence in markets where we 're already present , " obermann said . " that will enable us to achieve economies of scale and win market share , " he said .
" neighboring markets come in second place for us because they offer size advantages , such as joint purchasing and it platforms , " the chairman said . in march , the newly installed chief had said that given the cut-throat competition in its home market , deutsche telekom saw foreign expansion as a chance to boost profitability . at the time , obermann had complained that while deutsche telekom was very dependent on the german , european and us markets , it did not have any substantial presence in fast-growing economies , such as those in asia . europe remains hunting ground the german giant still planned to develop in those countries in the mid- to long-term , he said . deutsche telekom 's strategy differs substantially from that of its major european rivals , with british mobile operator vodafone recently acquiring hutchison essar in india and france telecom expanding in africa . europe would remain the main hunting ground for deutsche telekom , obermann said . " the european market will have to consolidate .

" t-mobile usa is not for sale , " he said , insisting that the us subsidiary was an important growth engine for the entire group . the market capitalization of t-mobile usa was currently higher than the rest of deutsche telekom , which could raise the possibility of a possible break-up of the group . but obermann rejected such suggestions .

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .
" the suit is an attempt by mr. kirch to divert attention from his own responsibility for the collapse of his group , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.06.2007 bayern throws money at a big problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern introduced two new faces on june 7 coming off their worst season in 12 years , bayern munich are sparing no expense to revamp their squad .
but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .
the arrival of toni , and perhaps klose , however , could shake up what remains of team chemistry from 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski could find himself the odd man out if bayern do land klose , roy makaay is probably gone , and lukas poldolski may find himself on the bench , since hitzfeld is unlikely to play a 4-3-3 .
meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .
the whole squad will be under intense pressure to excel in order to prove that management did n't squander mountains of cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld hope to be celebrating again one is tempted to give uli hoeness the benefit of the doubt .
since becoming bayern 's commercial manager in 1979 , he has been by far and away the bundesliga 's best judge of talent . but even he admits that bayern 57-million-euro spending spree is a risk .

cycling 's image in germany has been rocked by several high-profile doping admissions from cyclists competing for the former telekom team , now renamed team t-mobile .
team t-mobile will compete under that name in the tour , which starts in london on july 7 .

a " soigneur " who worked with the telekom team said he injected ullrich with the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , although ullrich denies the accusations . german magazine sport-bild has revealed details of an e-mail from a friend of ullrich 's to merkel which invited the german chancellor to his lake constance home to help the 33-year-old " rehabilitate his reputation . " but government spokesman thomas steg is quoted in wednesday 's edition of sport-bild stating that " a meeting between the chancellor and jan ullrich is not considered appropriate . " ullrich , who won the 1997 tour de france , retired in february having been sacked by team t-mobile last july after he was linked , along with dozens of other riders , to the spanish doping investigation dubbed " operation puerto " which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.06.2007 eu countries reject call for hosting illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta , spain and italy are on the front lines when it comes to illegal immigrants from africa the eu says it wants to save the lives of african migrants desperate to reach its shores but struggled to find ways to help frontline state malta handle the problem . european union countries on tuesday brushed off maltese calls for creating a system to take in illegal immigrants picked up outside eu territory , but vowed to boost border patrols and strengthen cooperation with transit countries .
while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .

many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .

billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .

the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .

organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence .

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i wanted to let the travelers know that most of the trains and public transportation are so much cheaper if you buy the ticket in advance and also if you travel with a group of five people .
i bought my ticket from hamburg to frankfurt and paid 29 euros -lrb- about $ 39 -rrb- ; the regular price was 99 euros .
just the fact that i bought it two weeks in advance saved me 70 euros .
you can buy the tickets per internet with the deutsche bahn . - elisa weber , mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is worth a visit i was born in alrenburg , a small town in eastern germany .
later i moved to leipzig and now i 'm living in perth , western australia .
my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .

in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence . " friis said he now intended to hold the conference in denmark later this year . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.06.2007 eu countries reject call for hosting illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta , spain and italy are on the front lines when it comes to illegal immigrants from africa the eu says it wants to save the lives of african migrants desperate to reach its shores but struggled to find ways to help frontline state malta handle the problem . european union countries on tuesday brushed off maltese calls for creating a system to take in illegal immigrants picked up outside eu territory , but vowed to boost border patrols and strengthen cooperation with transit countries .
while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .
pull factor sweden and italy , among others , argued that a scheme to distribute would-be immigrants according to the size of eu countries would only be a pull-factor for illegal migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spanish coast guard boat rescues a group of would-be immigrants schäuble said that the eu would assist malta " first and foremost " by assisting the tiny country in search and rescue operations in the mediterranean .
struggling to cope with an ongoing immigrant crisis off its coast with libya , the eu 's smallest member state malta has called repeatedly for solidarity from other eu countries .
" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .
he also said that the commission would work to bring libya on board of european operations in patrolling the eu 's southern borders .
some 7 million euros in extra funds will be made available to strengthen the bloc 's frontier watchdog , frattini said , adding that a new patrol mission in the mediterranean would start on june 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate to reach europe thousands of poor africans cross the mediterranean sea each year in a bid to enter the eu illegally via malta , italy and spain .
many of the would-be migrants , using rickety boats to make the hazardous sea crossing to europe , have drowned on the way .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against the illegals .
since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .
human rights groups have urged the eu to take urgent measures to prevent further immigrants ' deaths .
recent eu policies were not deterring people from trying to enter europe but " rather force the most vulnerable individuals to seek more and more dangerous and desperate methods of entry , " they argued .
different asylum policies swedish integration minister tobias billstroem told reporters that eu governments had taken " the first steps " towards building a common asylum policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers can get lost in the different bureaucracies of eu states despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to iraqi claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers .
billstroem called on eu governments to offer more places for resettling refugees and said that the bloc must work with the united nations in setting up a quota system to take in people fleeing iraq .
sweden , which grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers , hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc is likely to reach 40,000 this year .
frattini has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and has vowed to push for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules in the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 12.06.2007 -rrb- eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved .

while german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that the 27-member bloc was ready to " share responsibility " and " put forward proposals for burden-sharing , " his eu counterparts flatly rejected the maltese pleas .
these were for a system to be set up under which illegal migrants rescued or intercepted by eu ships outside european waters would be admitted by the bloc 's countries .
germany holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of this month .
" most states are silent to our proposal , " maltese interior minister tonio borg said after a meeting with his eu colleagues .

" the first priority is to save lives , the second is to settle the situation of people saved at sea , " schäuble said .
looking for a strategy eu justice commissioner france frattini said that eu experts would meet in the coming weeks to try and find ways to deal with illegal immigrants intercepted outside eu waters .

since the beginning of 2007 , malta has saved 315 shipwrecked immigrants seeking to enter europe in rickety boats .
borg said that 250 of them were taken on board maltese ships in the past 15 days .

but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict . the dresden city council chose a new , simpler version of the bridge late tuesday night .
it was developed by a stuttgart engineering and architecture firm and represents a desperate bid to end a legal battle that has gone to germany 's highest court . in 2004 , unesco declared a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12.4-mile -rrb- long stretch of riverside landscape in dresden a world cultural heritage site .
at the time , the city celebrated that distinction - not realizing that it would create a conflict with the plans , drawn up in 1996 , to build a bridge to help commuters get across the elbe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is one of germany 's prettiest cities in 2005 , citizens of dresden decided by referendum that they wanted the construction project .
the following year , unesco classified dresden 's waterfront as endangered and threatened to strip the city of its heritage site status if it changed the river landscape . simple and light-footed advocates of the bridge insist that the 160 million-euro -lrb- $ 210 million -rrb- project must go ahead .
the city government has repeatedly challenged those demands , but a series of courts - including , mostly recently , germany 's constitutional court - have ruled that dresden must honor both the results of the referendum and existing contracts for building work . as a result , the city was forced to start constructing access roads , before the future of the bridge was definitively settled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco says the old design would spoil the landscape government officials hope that the new design will not only connect the two sides of the elbe but bridge the gap between historic preservation concerns and economic and transportation interests . the jury that chose the revised design from six proposals praised it as being " simple and light-footed . " now dresden will have to wait and see whether bridge advocates accept the compromise .

but amid all the high-profile signings the question is : can the club spend its way out of the current slump ? the southern german giants have shelled out 57 million euros -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- thus far this summer to bring in international stars like italian striker luca toni and french midfielder frank ribery .
it 's a change in strategy for a team that has previously been known as much for its relative parsimony , compared with clubs like chelsea or real madrid , as for its success . in terms of quality , there can be no arguing with bringing a toni or a ribery .
the italian scored 47 goals over the past two seasons for fiorentina in serie a , while the frenchman helped lead the équipe tricolore to the world cup finals last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose could be wearing red and white next year and if bayern get their way , that illustrious duo will be joined by germany 's best striker , miroslav klose , who 's in the final year of his contract with werder bremen . the prospect of fielding a new and improved bayern with that trio has commercial manager uli hoeness dropping predictions of a new era of munich dominance .
but while they 've collecting an impressive array of fresh talent , bayern 's bosses have n't really addressed the positions most critics feel were the weakest last year . no new ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have n't been the same since ballack left for chelsea the great bayern teams of recent years were anchored by two playmakers - first stefan effenberg , then michael ballack - and munich 's slump to fourth in the league last season was widely attributed to their failure to find an adequate successor at this position . ribery , however , does n't fit the bill since he , by his own admission , prefers to play on the wings .
it remains to be seen whether bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld will try to shoehorn him into that role , or whether the plan is to advance the ball along the sidelines .
and argentinean midfielder ernesto sosa is an unknown quantity . assuming bayern can push the ball upfield more productively this season , they 'll have no shortage of players waiting in the box to knock it in .

meanwhile , the other new striker , jan schlaudraff , must be asking himself why bayern bothered to sign him away from aachen last winter . it will be interesting to see whether bayern can establish new hierarchy among the scorers or whether the front line falls victim to in-fighting . no defensive help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need defender ismael to get back on his feet another problem zone was bayern 's defense , which was merely average last season .
the interior of lucio and daniel van buyten came in for particular criticism for being , respectively , too reckless going forward and too prone to costly blunders . bayern are hoping that the return from injury of central defender valerien ismael will be enough to shore up this crucial area .
but ismael turns 32 next year , and having broken his leg and missed almost all of last season , he may find it hard to return to his old form . that defense could be sternly tested , as last season 's mediocrity has dispersed bayern 's aura of invincibility and may lead opponents to attack more .

child prostitution , large-scale bribery and massive interference in court trials are just some of the things that saxon state officials are being accused of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere as details on the scandal have emerged , calls for a public accounting have increased .
finally , late tuesday , saxony 's interior minister ousted rainer stock , the head of the state 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . merkel aide implicated the scandal has tentacles that reach into federal politics , if indirectly .
thomas de maiziere , angela merkel 's chief of staff and coordinator of german intelligence services , was a top official in the saxon government during the period of time covered by the scandal . de maiziere is accused of having withheld important information about the corruption affair from state authorities during his tenure as saxony 's interior minister , from 2004-2005 . despite the fact that a lawyer in saxony has brought a charge against de maiziere accusing him of failing to initiate investigations despite his early knowledge of corruption cases , the government official argues that the facts known to him then were too flimsy to take action right away . de maiziere ' relaxed ' but de maiziere claimed he is " very relaxed " about the affair . " much more is now obviously known about corruption cases back then , " he told reporters .
" but i ’ m not in the picture of what 's been found out on the ground .
and i do n't need to be in the picture , because i 'm no longer interior minister in saxony . " the prosecutor 's office in dresden , which has been charged with investigating the growing scandal , has asked intelligence services to provide all documents pertaining to the affair by july 1 . de maiziere 's successor in dresden , geert mackenroth , tried hard to play things down , despite being forced to take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck has ' serious doubts ' about de maiziere " i hasten to add that i 'm not yet in a position to say anything about how justified these accusations are and who really departed from the straight and narrow , " mackenroth said . secret files , illegal data according to press reports , however , the domestic intelligence agency has secret files that contain information showing ties between organized crime , the justice department , politicians and police in saxony .
the now-deposed stock had been under pressure about some of the files , which were compiled using partly illegal means between 2003 and 2006 . meanwhile , the opposition has leapt on the scandal and has called for de maiziere , who is in angela merkel 's cdu party , to step down until the matter is cleared up . " de maiziere should leave his post as the intelligence coordinator for the german government until the investigating committee in saxony has put forth its final report , " jan mücke , a leading parliamentarian for the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele called for de maiziere to explain himself .
another green parliamentarian , volker beck , told online news source netzeitung.de that de had " serious doubts " that de maiziere " is the right man to stay in the job of coordinating federal intelligence agencies . " corruption : not a recent phenomenon jürgen roth , an investigative journalist and author who has followed the saxon dealings while doing research for a book on corruption , said : " we 're talking about criminal networks in a number of saxon towns , with leipzig only being the tip of the iceberg . " there 's been large-scale collaboration between high-profile justice officials , former stasi secret police officers and organized crime cells , " roth said .
" this is not a recent phenomenon .
on the contrary , such structures have been in place in saxony since the early 1990s - that is since right after german unification . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the battle dates back to february 2002 , when breuer , who was deutsche bank 's ceo at the time , publicly questioned the credit-worthiness of the kirch group in a television interview .
kirch argues that breuer 's comments directly led to the collapse of his debt-laden media empire , which filed for insolvency later that year .
deutsche bank and breuer countered that kirch 's financial problems were already well known and that breuer 's comments came under personal freedom of expression .
ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch in 2003 , a court in munich found in kirch 's favor , at least in principle , without actually ordering deutsche bank to pay concrete damages , for which kirch would have to sue separately .
not satisfied by the ruling , both sides appealed to the federal supreme court , the bundesgerichtshof .
germany 's highest court then found in january 2006 that deutsche bank and breuer were indeed liable in principle for the collapse of at least part of the kirch group , which was one of germany 's most spectacular corporate failures .
but since deutsche bank was only the creditor of one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and had contravened its contractual obligations only towards that particular unit , it was only liable to pay the damages for that company .
the judges also said the bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire kirch group .
a new trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf breuer a court spokesman said wednesday that the new trial would begin by next spring at the latest .
kirch 's lawyers will have to show how the former media magnate calculated that he was due 1.2 billion euros in compensation .
deutsche bank said it was not worried by the claims , which it said were " unfounded . "
the bank expected the court to reject kirch 's claims , a spokesman said .

documenta , which is held every five years , aims to provide a snap shot of cutting-edge developments in the art world . giving westerners ' a chance to view china ' to organize the piece , ai posted word on his blog in february that he would offer a free trip to germany , and within three days the number of registered people had already exceeded his target . each applicant had to answer 99 questions , including one about their dreams .
the subjects chosen to come are everyday people like li baoyuan , a 41-year-old farmer from a village in an impoverished region of gansu province who has never traveled anywhere in his life . ai explained his exhibit in detail on the blog of megan shank , a shanghai based journalist . " the origin of ' fairytale ' is that i hoped to find a way to bring china ’ s current social condition to kassel , and thus allow westerners to view a sample of modern china society , " ai said . the 1,001 individuals whose visas have been approved will be divided into five groups that from june 12th on will leave in stages for kassel ; each group will remain there on average for eight days .
during just over one month ’ s time , quite a few asian faces will be appearing in kassel , a city with 250,000 residents . ' we do n't know how locals will react ' " we don ’ t know how the locals will react to this sudden " eastern wave , " but we ’ re interested to find out .
and the city government is being very supportive , " ai told shi yun . ai noted that " fairytale " also includes written materials , photos , and a documentary that records the entire event .
he said he does n't call the piece performance art .
rather , he sees it as a case of " art as field study .

my boyfriend -lrb- he 's half norwegian , half australian -rrb- and i both study tourism management at edith cowan university in perth and we both decided to write an assignment about dresden and its culture .
dresden is very rich in culture ; however it needs to be more promoted on an international scale .
most of the people that i meet in australia have never heard about this town , but when i show them pictures they are fascinated and interested in traveling there . - carolin koerner , germany recently someone asked me " where is your most favorite place ? "
the answer came quickly because there really is no contest in my mind : bamberg .
my visit with my wife and children in 1993 was much too short , but the good memories have lived on for all of us .
the beautiful scenery , magnificent architecture , franconian wine in the funny bottles , rauchbier , and great food - all of this pales in comparison to the wonderful , friendly people of all ages in bamberg .
if you have not visited this wonderful city , you have missed an opportunity you will treasure for a lifetime ! - gary jacobs , texas , usa we spent a few hours in lübeck three years ago and marveled at the gate , the lion statues and the dom .
the article on lübeck brought back pleasant memories . - bernard scott , australia i lived for over 30 years in germany and moved to canada three years ago .
just three examples from my daily observations : 1 -rrb- if i had to wait for a freight train to pass by in germany , i saw only 20 to 30 wagons .
if i have to wait for a freight train to pass by in vancouver , i see about 110 wagons full of coal from the mountains .
this is a plus for canada .
2 -rrb- in germany i was the owner of my land .
in canada only the crown is the owner of land - i hold only a bundle of rights .
this is a plus for canada .
3 -rrb- in the hamburg area , where we lived , there were about 10 construction projects at the same time .
in vancouver we have about 100 at a same time .
this is a plus for canada .
in europe we do not have the land , the coal or the laws to compete with canada .
that is why i think - based on my daily observations - that europe 's economic development relies heavily on scientific innovation as well as business and trade skills . - henry , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.06.2007 controversial stasi conference cancelled in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi put many critics of the east german regime in prison for years the former east german secret police stasi was notorious for infiltrating civilian society , as well as for its foreign activities .
but a planned forum on its activities abroad has been cancelled due to severe criticism . a controversial conference with former top level east german spies has been cancelled in berlin .
organizer thomas wegener friis said the event was to focus on the so-called hva , the foreign intelligence branch of the secret police stasi in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- . " espionage was an important part of the cold war and we need to understand foreign intelligence in order to understand this period in history , " said friis , an assistant professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense . but the stasi archives authority bstu in berlin withdrew its participation in the conference at short notice , sparking its subsequent cancellation .
bstu director marianne birthler said in a statement that no expert from her office would be allowed to take part . according to birthler , previous public remarks by former high-ranking stasi officers about their tasks and activities disqualified them from being serious discussion partners or even contemporary witnesses . " it was very bitter for us that birthler took that position against the conference , " friis said .
" her decision came as a stroke of lightning to us . "
the stasi archives had initially agreed to participate in the event with an expert speaker . the max planck society , which was to host the conference , pulled out of the event as a result of birthler 's decision .
according to friis , the society said that without the bstu expert 's participation , the conference could have no longer presented a balanced view of the issue . confrontation would have been possible conservative politician friedbert pflüger said he supported birthler 's decision . " there should be no new stage for former stasi offenders to propagate their take on history , " pflüger said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupp , also known as topas , spied for the stasi at nato for years " dealing with the past is important and right , but not by those who violated the human rights of millions of people in the gdr or who pursued espionage abroad for the sed dictatorship , " pflüger said .
the sed , or socialist unity party of germany , was east germany 's governing party . historian hubertus knabe , director of the former stasi prison in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen , now a memorial and museum , said the former stasi speakers were in no way prepared to participate in a critical academic analysis of their one-time activities . the list of speakers included werner grossmann , the last head of the hva , and his deputies horst vogel and ralf devaux .
the top stasi spy at nato , rainer rupp , was also invited . but friis said historians who had worked on the topic were also invited .
a confrontation with the former stasi officers would have been possible and he said the scathing criticism should be more differentiated . " i can understand the victims of the gdr , " he said , since they lived with the ruthless stasi organization and often had bitter personal experiences with it .
" but i do n't understand birthler , " he added . stasi should not be made taboo professor klaus schroeder , head of the research association on the sed state at berlin 's free university , said critics should have dealt with the issue more calmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi was regarded as one of the most effective intelligence agencies in the world " there was a bit of hysteria about it , " schroeder said .
" why should n't academics take these arguments apart ?
they should have faced up to the confrontation . " schroeder said east germany 's stasi past was of historical significance , especially considering that key contemporaries were getting older .
but it would be more suitable to have a podium discussion with former secret police and academics present to discuss and pick apart the stasi 's activities , he said . " it 's better to take on these arguments instead of making them taboo , " schroeder said . a poor choice of date many critics of the conference condemned friis ' choice of timing : the weekend of june 17 .
this date coincided with the east german uprising of 1953 , which escalated on june 17 . schroeder said the date choice was " a provocation . "
but friis said the date was chosen for purely practical purposes and " an unlucky coincidence . " friis said he now intended to hold the conference in denmark later this year . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the digital revolution , however , has little respect for legends .
just like any other media giant , disney has to fight for its share of an audience that has seen an " explosion of choice " , says tom staggs , walt disney 's chief financial officer .
new technology , he says , has put " the consumer much more in charge than ever before " .
a few years back , under former chief executive michael eisner , disney stumbled badly .
now run by robert iger the company is hitting its stride again .
its share price has gained 24 % over the past two years .
during the last financial year sales were up 7 % , while profits soared 33 % .
but how does disney do it ?
brand value walt disney hq : burbank , california founded : 1923 annual sales : $ 34bn annual profit : $ 3.4bn staff : 133,000 " fundamentally , we are a company driven by content creation and exploitation of content across many platforms , " says mr staggs .
good content alone , however , will get a company only that far .
" if you 've got a sea of choice , then having a strong brand is critical to cut through the clutter , " says mr staggs .
most important , of course , is the disney " core brand " , with its movies , television shows , children 's magazines , theme parks , leisure cruises , and shelves upon shelves full of merchandise .
then there is the hugely successful espn sports brand , which encompasses not just the television channel , but also a bevy of websites and a range of video games .
the abc television network , meanwhile , keeps churning out hit shows like lost , desperate housewives and ugly betty .
and film studios like pixar , touchstone and miramax are rounding off the world 's second largest media group -lrb- behind time warner -rrb- .
tailor-made growth but with the mouse ear logo ubiquitous already , where is there room for growth ?
mr staggs sees key opportunities in relatively mature markets , such as france , japan and germany - at least during the coming five years .
beyond that , in a " five to 10 year horizon " , developing markets including south america , china and india will become more important for delivering profits .
disney , says mr staggs , has to tailor its approach for each individual market , " methodically but quickly building -lsb- its -rsb- brand presence " .
in the world 's two largest markets , disney has already sizeable operations .
in india a takeover has positioned the company as the country 's top children 's television group , while in china , disney has a big retail operation , and 250 million people can watch disney programmes .
and on 29 june , disney will premiere the secret of the magic gourd , a film combining live action with animation - made in china for the chinese market .
it 's all about making the all-important disney brand " more relevant to the local market , " says mr staggs .
if it 's a success , the company may export the film elsewhere .
disney backs its local content strategy with a $ 100m -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- investment fund to support about 20 different film projects over the next two to three years .
but there are areas where disney has to tread carefully .
in china , for example , disney 's internet ambitions have to be " consistent with both our brand and government regulations " .
" in some instances you walk before you run , " he adds .
multiplatform strategy the main drivers of disney 's success are what mr staggs calls " our vibrant content engines " - from film studios to theme parks .
and if one strikes gold , the other parts of disney will also try to mine it .
the cinema blockbuster pirates of the caribbean is a typical example .
it started life as a theme park ride in disneyland , was then turned into a movie , which was accompanied by a deluge of merchandise - from books to action figures .
disney 's pirates of the caribbean video game has shot to number one on every platform in the uk , france and germany .
and at the end of june , disney will launch a massive multiplayer online role-playing game based on the franchise .
it is this platform diversification that allows disney to engage audiences at every level of the digital universe , thus turning a tidy profit .
luring players riding the digital tiger , however , is not without risk .
most media firms facing the digital revolution have the " gut instinct of protecting their old business model , " says mr staggs .
disney , he implies , is different .
already the company is trying out plenty of new business models for the on-demand world .
disney sells films through apple 's itunes download store .
its subsidiary abc offers hit television shows on-demand through the abc.com player - with each show sponsored by a single advertiser .
and the pirates of the caribbean online game lures in players by making a few levels accessible for free .
those who want to swashbuckle through more of the virtual world , will need to pay a $ 10 monthly subscription .
so what works best ?
pay per view , pay per download , or pay through advertising ? "
broadcast television is alive and well " tom staggs walt disney " we are going to continue to test different business models , " says mr staggs , but quickly adds that advertising is the biggest digital revenue driver by far .
it is a business that disney understands .
" we 've been in the business of renting our audiences to the advertisers for a long time . "
advertising sweet spot the numbers are still fairly small , though .
of disney 's $ 34bn annual revue , about $ 1.5bn is classed as digital - but $ 800m of that is online sales of holiday packages .
that leaves a relatively measly $ 700m of true digital media revenue .
that does n't put off disney .
not only is the digital sector growing fast , it is also hitting the advertisers ' sweet spot .
abc 's media player , for example , offers 17 shows and has served some 100 million episodes since september last year .
and it has delivered a much sought after audience .
abc already boasts the youngest audience of all us television networks , with an average age of 43 .
but the abc.com player has an audience in its late twenties , and delivers a whopping 80 % recall rate for the sponsors .
an astonishing 20 % of viewers interact with the ads .
" what you 've got is the beginning of an enhanced advertising experience , " says mr staggs .
broadcast ' not dead ' despite disney 's digital ambitions , he is also convinced that old-fashioned broadcasting will continue to be " the most important part " of disney 's media offering .
" broadcast television is alive and well , " asserts mr staggs .
but there are changes at the edges .
in south korea , one of the world 's most wired nations , high-speed broadband is already delivering a " second prime time " , where films are watched during the lunch break on the day after the original transmission , says andy bird , president of walt disney international .
and mobile media consumption is growing rapidly in countries that have poor fixed-line infrastructure .
but what about disney 's most valuable asset , its vast archive of films ?
will the mouse shake the " long tail " of its media offering and make it available on demand ?
that 's where disney 's digital ambitions end and hard-nosed brand management takes over .
there wo n't be an end to disney 's " platinum strategy " of brand exploitation , which sees about 10 to 12 films in circulation at any one time .
after a while , says mr staggs , disney will put them back into the vault , until a new generation of children has grown up to rediscover the little mermaid , cinderella or peter pan .
but are n't the likes of ebay undermining this hugely profitable strategy ?
ebay , asserts mr staggs , " has n't spoiled it " for us yet .
blockbuster risk and what about the mouse itself ?
when will we see " mickey , the movie " ?
that , it appears , is a touchy subject .
mr staggs chooses his words very carefully .
mickey mouse , he says , is such a vital part of the disney brand that the concept would have to be 100 % right before disney would risk it on a blockbuster movie .
" mickey has an everyman quality to him " , he adds , and counsels that it would probably be best not to define him through a film .
so for now , fans will have to watch old cartoons or make the trip to disney 's theme parks to get close up and personal with their favourite mouse .

disney hopes its franchises can deliver digital magic that 's where disney 's digital ambitions end and hard-nosed brand management takes over .
there wo n't be an end to disney 's " platinum strategy " of brand exploitation , which sees about 10 to 12 films in circulation at any one time .
after a while , says mr staggs , disney will put them back into the vault , until a new generation of children has grown up to rediscover the little mermaid , cinderella or peter pan .
but are n't the likes of ebay undermining this hugely profitable strategy ?
ebay , asserts mr staggs , " has n't spoiled it " for us yet .
blockbuster risk and what about the mouse itself ?
when will we see " mickey , the movie " ?
that , it appears , is a touchy subject .
mr staggs chooses his words very carefully .
mickey mouse , he says , is such a vital part of the disney brand that the concept would have to be 100 % right before disney would risk it on a blockbuster movie .
" mickey has an everyman quality to him " , he adds , and counsels that it would probably be best not to define him through a film .
so for now , fans will have to watch old cartoons or make the trip to disney 's theme parks to get close up and personal with their favourite mouse .

the digital revolution , however , has little respect for legends .
just like any other media giant , disney has to fight for its share of an audience that has seen an " explosion of choice " , says tom staggs , walt disney 's chief financial officer .
new technology , he says , has put " the consumer much more in charge than ever before " .
a few years back , under former chief executive michael eisner , disney stumbled badly .
now run by robert iger the company is hitting its stride again .
its share price has gained 24 % over the past two years .
during the last financial year sales were up 7 % , while profits soared 33 % .
but how does disney do it ?
brand value walt disney hq : burbank , california founded : 1923 annual sales : $ 34bn annual profit : $ 3.4bn staff : 133,000 " fundamentally , we are a company driven by content creation and exploitation of content across many platforms , " says mr staggs .
good content alone , however , will get a company only that far .
" if you 've got a sea of choice , then having a strong brand is critical to cut through the clutter , " says mr staggs .
most important , of course , is the disney " core brand " , with its movies , television shows , children 's magazines , theme parks , leisure cruises , and shelves upon shelves full of merchandise .
then there is the hugely successful espn sports brand , which encompasses not just the television channel , but also a bevy of websites and a range of video games .
the abc television network , meanwhile , keeps churning out hit shows like lost , desperate housewives and ugly betty .
and film studios like pixar , touchstone and miramax are rounding off the world 's second largest media group -lrb- behind time warner -rrb- .
tailor-made growth but with the mouse ear logo ubiquitous already , where is there room for growth ?
disney is keen to adapt itself to local tastes mr staggs sees key opportunities in relatively mature markets , such as france , japan and germany - at least during the coming five years .
beyond that , in a " five to 10 year horizon " , developing markets including south america , china and india will become more important for delivering profits .
disney , says mr staggs , has to tailor its approach for each individual market , " methodically but quickly building -lsb- its -rsb- brand presence " .
in the world 's two largest markets , disney has already sizeable operations .
in india a takeover has positioned the company as the country 's top children 's television group , while in china , disney has a big retail operation , and 250 million people can watch disney programmes .
pirates of the caribbean moved from theme park to big screen ...
and on 29 june , disney will premiere the secret of the magic gourd , a film combining live action with animation - made in china for the chinese market .
it 's all about making the all-important disney brand " more relevant to the local market , " says mr staggs .
if it 's a success , the company may export the film elsewhere .
disney backs its local content strategy with a $ 100m -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- investment fund to support about 20 different film projects over the next two to three years .
but there are areas where disney has to tread carefully .
in china , for example , disney 's internet ambitions have to be " consistent with both our brand and government regulations " .
" in some instances you walk before you run , " he adds .
multiplatform strategy the main drivers of disney 's success are what mr staggs calls " our vibrant content engines " - from film studios to theme parks . ... and is now a successful video game franchise and if one strikes gold , the other parts of disney will also try to mine it .
the cinema blockbuster pirates of the caribbean is a typical example .
it started life as a theme park ride in disneyland , was then turned into a movie , which was accompanied by a deluge of merchandise - from books to action figures .
disney 's pirates of the caribbean video game has shot to number one on every platform in the uk , france and germany .
and at the end of june , disney will launch a massive multiplayer online role-playing game based on the franchise .
it is this platform diversification that allows disney to engage audiences at every level of the digital universe , thus turning a tidy profit .
luring players riding the digital tiger , however , is not without risk .
most media firms facing the digital revolution have the " gut instinct of protecting their old business model , " says mr staggs .
disney , he implies , is different .
the abc.com player delivers a young audience already the company is trying out plenty of new business models for the on-demand world .
disney sells films through apple 's itunes download store .
its subsidiary abc offers hit television shows on-demand through the abc.com player - with each show sponsored by a single advertiser .
and the pirates of the caribbean online game lures in players by making a few levels accessible for free .
those who want to swashbuckle through more of the virtual world , will need to pay a $ 10 monthly subscription .
so what works best ?
pay per view , pay per download , or pay through advertising ?
broadcast television is alive and well tom staggs walt disney " we are going to continue to test different business models , " says mr staggs , but quickly adds that advertising is the biggest digital revenue driver by far .
it is a business that disney understands .
" we 've been in the business of renting our audiences to the advertisers for a long time . "
advertising sweet spot the numbers are still fairly small , though .
of disney 's $ 34bn annual revue , about $ 1.5bn is classed as digital - but $ 800m of that is online sales of holiday packages .
that leaves a relatively measly $ 700m of true digital media revenue .
tom staggs says broadcasting is alive and well that does n't put off disney .
not only is the digital sector growing fast , it is also hitting the advertisers ' sweet spot .
abc 's media player , for example , offers 17 shows and has served some 100 million episodes since september last year .
and it has delivered a much sought after audience .
abc already boasts the youngest audience of all us television networks , with an average age of 43 .
but the abc.com player has an audience in its late twenties , and delivers a whopping 80 % recall rate for the sponsors .
an astonishing 20 % of viewers interact with the ads .
" what you 've got is the beginning of an enhanced advertising experience , " says mr staggs .
broadcast ' not dead ' despite disney 's digital ambitions , he is also convinced that old-fashioned broadcasting will continue to be " the most important part " of disney 's media offering .
" broadcast television is alive and well , " asserts mr staggs .
but there are changes at the edges .
in south korea , one of the world 's most wired nations , high-speed broadband is already delivering a " second prime time " , where films are watched during the lunch break on the day after the original transmission , says andy bird , president of walt disney international .
and mobile media consumption is growing rapidly in countries that have poor fixed-line infrastructure .
but what about disney 's most valuable asset , its vast archive of films ?
will the mouse shake the " long tail " of its media offering and make it available on demand ?
disney hopes its franchises can deliver digital magic that 's where disney 's digital ambitions end and hard-nosed brand management takes over .
there wo n't be an end to disney 's " platinum strategy " of brand exploitation , which sees about 10 to 12 films in circulation at any one time .
after a while , says mr staggs , disney will put them back into the vault , until a new generation of children has grown up to rediscover the little mermaid , cinderella or peter pan .
but are n't the likes of ebay undermining this hugely profitable strategy ?
ebay , asserts mr staggs , " has n't spoiled it " for us yet .
blockbuster risk and what about the mouse itself ?
when will we see " mickey , the movie " ?

sidra afzal , from fleur-de-lys , near caerphilly , is being treated by doctors at morriston hospital , swansea .
they implanted a special balloon under her scalp 10 months ago which has steadily grown with new skin and hair .
now they plan to remove the gel-filled balloon and pull the new skin and hair follicles over sidra 's burnt head .
sidra was two when she suffered 25 % burns from cooking oil in an accident at her home , leaving her bald on one side of her head .
doctors grafted skin from her thighs onto burns on her back and arm to lessen the scarring but her scalp remained red and swollen , and her hair did not grow back .
how tissue expansion works 1 .
no hair can grow on scar tissue after severe burn 2 .
tissue expander is gradually filled with saline solution by injection through tube under skin 3 .
expander removed ; stretched skin with hair covers wound her mother saba , 38 , said : " she was left self-conscious about her bald patch .
" all little girls fuss about their hair and she is no different .
" she always wears a hat when we go out and she kept asking me when she would get her hair back . "
surgeons at the welsh centre for burns and plastic surgery in morriston are carrying out the tissue expansion procedure .
a 90-minute operation will be carried out this week and , if it is a success , sidra will be able to return to school in september after spending a year having tutoring at home since the balloon was implanted .
the balloon has been filled with a special gel at the rate of six teaspoons full each week - with the healthy skin and hair stretching around it .
it now contains more than a litre of liquid and is the same size as her head .
dr bill dickson , the burns centre 's director , said sidra was a " delightful little child to look after " .
" it is a rare procedure but we are very hopeful her new scalp will grow with her because it is her skin .
" the injections and the expanding balloon can be quite uncomfortable .
but sidra has coped really well . "
double-take her mother saba said ; " sidra is so brave .
before the first operation , her doctor explained what would happen and asked if she wanted to go ahead .
" she answered : ' as long as i can look nice , i do n't mind the pain . "
sidra 's father , shopkeeper mohammed , 46 , said they had to watch her " like a hawk " to make sure she did not bang her head .
" it looks scary but it is virtually painless , " he said .
" she does feel the balloon move and wobble from time to time , though .
" people do a double-take and some stop to ask why her head is like this .
it 's only natural that they are curious .
" but sidra always has a smile on her face and is very proud of her thick hair growing over the top of the balloon , " he added .

lekit stationery said children aged 12 and 13 were employed by one of its sub-contractors , although they did not work on olympic-related products .
the news follows an investigation in dongguan city , where lekit is based .
it was launched after an advocacy group claimed four firms making olympic products were exploiting workers .
lekit manager michael lee told the bbc that a sub-contractor called leter stationery had hired a number of children in the school holidays last winter .
they were each paid 20 yuan -lrb- about $ 2.50 -rrb- a day .
' unaware ' because it had a large number of orders , lekit was forced to hire leter stationary to make packaging products , such as labels .
mr lee insisted these products were not related to the contract it won last year to produce stationery emblazoned with olympic symbols .
" we did n't know that they would hire children , " mr lee said , although the sub-contractor 's factory is directly opposite lekit stationary .
china hopes to make huge profits on olympic merchandise he added : " we will not use them again , and in future we will make sure that all sub-contractors are qualified . "
mr lee , from taiwan , said when he was initially interviewed about the allegation by the bbc at his factory he was unaware leter stationery had hired children .
he found out only when dongguan officials released the findings of an initial investigation into the issue .
a dongguan official said the children had gone to work at leter stationery because their parents had no time to look after them during the holidays .
he said they were only involved in " light work " such as wrapping up products .
" the dongguan government -lrb- will -rrb- start a campaign to fight child labour in the city soon , " said a report published by chinese state-run xinhua news agency .
the report that made the initial allegation , issued by an alliance called playfair 2008 , said lekit had hired children who often had to work from 0730 to 2230 .
" some of them were brought to the factory to earn money to pay their school fees , " the report says .
it also accused three other factories based in southern guangdong province of exploiting workers .
they were charged with ignoring local labour laws , disregarding health and safety and forcing employees to work long hours .
the speed with which dongguan officials published the results of the initial investigation suggests china is keen to avoid bad publicity in the run up to next year 's olympic games .

the ambitious plan sets out an industry-wide target to cut the amount of energy computers consume by 2010 .
the scheme is expected to cut emissions by 54 million tonnes a year - equal to 11 million cars or 20 coal-fired power plants , company officials say .
hewlett-packard , dell and microsoft have all signed up to the campaign .
computers and other it equipment have been blamed for causing as much global warming as the airline industry .
" we think we can have huge savings in terms of carbon footprint and energy costs , " said pat gelsinger , senior vice president for intel 's digital enterprise group .
costs to rise ?
he estimated that using energy-efficient technology would make computers about $ 20 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- more expensive and servers about $ 30 pricier , but these costs would be offset by lower electricity bills .
utilities will be encouraged to offer rebates to consumers who buy the ' green pcs ' .
manufacturers who agree to the climate-saving program agree to design , produce and sell equipment that meet the us environmental protection agency 's energy star standard of 80 % initially .
that will rise to 90 % by 2010 .
the initiative is an extension of the world wildlife fund 's climate savers program , which helps companies to reduce their harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
initial supporters also include yahoo , hitachi and sun microsystems .
in addition to the environmental benefits , google co-founder larry page said the initiative would also act to make computers better - more reliable and quieter .
meanwhile in the uk , a new government taskforce has been formed to develop individual computers which use 98 % less energy than standard pcs .
