now swedish authorities have come under new pressure to release the names of swedish citizens suspected of working for the gdr 's secret service agency .
swedish media recently became interested after a book claimed that sapo kept a list of suspected stasi informers and journalists have requested the list be released . however , the agency has insisted that the information is classified .

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .
when funds from private foundations are added in , the total comes to around 600 million euros . the number of private sponsors of cultural projects in germany , however , is minimal compared to the united states . different tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring performers at a henry purcell opera in salzburg in germany , about 90 percent of funding for cultural programs comes from public funds , while in the us , it is only about 10 percent . part of the reason for that , said schwaiger , is different tax incentives for cultural sponsoring in the two countries . " but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .
but how much a company actually spends to that end is often not publicly announced . " it 's a success when a company spends ' x ' amount on cultural programs and journalists speculate that twice that ' x ' amount was spent , " said schwaiger . richard fuchs -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .
when funds from private foundations are added in , the total comes to around 600 million euros . the number of private sponsors of cultural projects in germany , however , is minimal compared to the united states . different tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring performers at a henry purcell opera in salzburg in germany , about 90 percent of funding for cultural programs comes from public funds , while in the us , it is only about 10 percent . part of the reason for that , said schwaiger , is different tax incentives for cultural sponsoring in the two countries . " but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .
but how much a company actually spends to that end is often not publicly announced .

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .

" many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .

recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany .

" change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .
life-long effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's authorities want to easily control who pays for refugees many of germany 's 16 states require refugees and others protected from deportation who receive welfare benefits to make their homes in the state , district , county or even municipality that issued their residence permits .
the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .
it could limit their employment opportunities and harm their familial or social lives , the agency said , such as in cases where those affected fell ill or had to deal with traumatic events without being able to live near family or fellow countrymen or -women . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .

the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .

it was the largest direct intervention in the frankfurt-based central bank 's history .
" this liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation follows up on the operation conducted yesterday and aims to assure orderly conditions in the euro money market , " the ecb said in a statement released friday .
the three-day " fine-tuning " operation was aimed at maintaining short-term rate stability after overnight rates banks charge each other to lend dollars reached six-year highs .
banks remain wary of lending due to concerns of overexposure to us subprime mortgage losses .
inter-bank rates friday were as much as 0.27 percent over the ecb 's benchmark of 4 percent .
an ecb spokesman acknowledged that thursday 's overnight liquidity injection was unusual , but said it had been motivated by the aim " to ensure orderly conditions in the money market . " less lending could curb growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stocks tumbled after the ecb announced its cash injection investors ' main fear is that banks will toughen lending terms to cover losses already incurred by us subprime mortgages and to prevent further shortfalls .
the result could be banks unwilling to lend cash to companies and consumers , which could drag down global economic growth .
" as private-sector banks , in a time of uncertainty , set aside more funds for their own funding needs , we are seeing a shortage of liquidity in the money markets , " societe generale 's chief asia economist , glenn maguire , told the afp news agency .
although aimed at settling markets , the ecb 's action , as well as a smaller fund injection thursday by the us federal reserve , caused widespread anxiety on stock markets around the world .
wall street fell sharply on thursday 's news , and the decline spread to asian markets on friday and to europe at the opening , although european markets later recovered some lost ground .

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .

yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .

after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution .

kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .
computer digital programming and design has brought amazing possibilities for design as you can see all over the world .
people are more conscious of architecture - they 're more willing to take risks .
we 've never had a better moment in architecture than we have today . how do you view german architecture today ? there 's some very good , young firms and there have been some wonderful firms in the past : egon heinemann , joseph paul kleihues and -lrb- oswald -rrb- matthias ungers , sauerbruch hutton , terrani , gerkan , marg and partner .
there are lots of firms who do fabulous work in germany .
i think german architecture is very good and the climate for architecture is very positive in germany . you 'll be celebrating your 75th birthday on august 11 .
will you be thinking about retirement ? no , i 'm not going to retire .
i have an undated contract with yale university to teach .
i have lots of things i want to do in architecture – both in writing and building .
i have n't built a tall building yet .
i would have liked to have built the -lrb- max -rrb- reinhardt haus -lrb- in berlin -rrb- but i was n't able to .
so i got a lot of things to do . stephanie raison interviewed peter eisenman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

that comes as no surprise to foreigners living here . the poll found that just 16 percent can laugh about their own misfortunes or embarrassing moments . but what might shock some is that the same survey found that germans are even less capable of laughing at the mishaps of others .
thirteen percent of germen men and just five percent of german women think there 's something funny about other people 's troubles . so although german has one word - schadenfreude - that perfectly describes taking delight in the disasters of others -lrb- which requires at least five words in english to express -rrb- , the germans themselves do n't seem to feel much of it . the study was commissioned by the hamburg-based magazine young care and surveyed 2,639 people aged between 16 and 72 years of age . while germans do n't much like to laugh at themselves , they do find comedy programs on television particularly funny - 68 percent said they can have a good chuckle while watching sitcoms , sketch shows or other comedy formats . one in two said their partners provided reasons to laugh while 44 percent laughed about jokes and 38 per cent found comedy films amusing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .
when funds from private foundations are added in , the total comes to around 600 million euros . the number of private sponsors of cultural projects in germany , however , is minimal compared to the united states . different tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring performers at a henry purcell opera in salzburg in germany , about 90 percent of funding for cultural programs comes from public funds , while in the us , it is only about 10 percent . part of the reason for that , said schwaiger , is different tax incentives for cultural sponsoring in the two countries . " but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .
when funds from private foundations are added in , the total comes to around 600 million euros . the number of private sponsors of cultural projects in germany , however , is minimal compared to the united states . different tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring performers at a henry purcell opera in salzburg in germany , about 90 percent of funding for cultural programs comes from public funds , while in the us , it is only about 10 percent . part of the reason for that , said schwaiger , is different tax incentives for cultural sponsoring in the two countries . " but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .
but how much a company actually spends to that end is often not publicly announced . " it 's a success when a company spends ' x ' amount on cultural programs and journalists speculate that twice that ' x ' amount was spent , " said schwaiger . richard fuchs -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .

" many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .
" they want to do something and not wait until government or companies take action .

a fear of nuclear accidents and difficulties with nuclear waste disposal have also driven more germans away from nuclear energy .
recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany . " a lot is changing in the united states as well , " he said .

" change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .
customers are neither happy with their prices , nor with the source of energy these companies use . going green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel had climate change on her agenda as eu president since the liberalization of the german energy sector in 1998 , the green party has encouraged people to switch to more ecologically oriented providers . however , the dominant position of the big four players , who rely mainly on energy from nuclear and fossil fuel sources , has largely gone unchallenged . now , even the director of the federal cartel office , bernhard heitzer , has begun appealing to germans to think about changing to a smaller provider . gerd billen , director of the association of german consumers , said consumers are heeding the call . " many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .
" they want to do something and not wait until government or companies take action . " switching to so-called eco-electricity providers means consumers can help reduce their co2 emissions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people taking green action in brussels this year a wide range of green power providers have sprung up like mushrooms on the german market . they provide power generated from renewable sources such as wind , water and the sun .
a fear of nuclear accidents and difficulties with nuclear waste disposal have also driven more germans away from nuclear energy .
recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany . " a lot is changing in the united states as well , " he said .
" awareness about climate change is growing and consumers are asking what they can do to slow the harmful effects of climate change . " awareness is also growing in the united kingdom , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar is a renewable energy source the association of german consumers has just started a new campaign to encourage even more people to change their power provider . posters for the campaign display pictures of electrical sockets on walls which look like monsters , with sharp teeth and a greedy mouth . " change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .
turning appliances completely off , rather than to just " stand-by " mode , can help save one household around 115 euros -lrb- $ 157 -rrb- a year . peter hille -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .

the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .

berlin , dresden and the neuschwanstein castle also scored well . visitors exiting cologne 's main train station can often be caught craning their necks , jaws open , as they catch a glimpse of the city 's cathedral , towering 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- above them .
it 's no wonder that 15.2 percent of participants in a recent survey selected the gothic structure as their favorite tourist destination .
the capital city also scored well in the survey , which was conducted by the german tourism association and the web site meinestadt.de.
four berlin sites - the brandenburg gate , the television tower , the reichstag , and the city as a whole - made the top 15 .
dresden , germany 's eastern gem , also proved popular among germans .
the church of our lady , which underwent renovation in 2005 , took third place , while the semper oper placed 41st .
for many outside the country , the oktoberfest is synonymous with germany .
but how did the bavarian beer bash fair with the 3,000 german survey participants ?
it came in at 11 - not bad , but perhaps not quite as well as it would have in a survey of non-germans .
in the questionnaire , germans selected these locations as their 10 favorite places to be a tourist : 1 .

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .

he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .

bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

that comes as no surprise to foreigners living here . the poll found that just 16 percent can laugh about their own misfortunes or embarrassing moments . but what might shock some is that the same survey found that germans are even less capable of laughing at the mishaps of others .
thirteen percent of germen men and just five percent of german women think there 's something funny about other people 's troubles . so although german has one word - schadenfreude - that perfectly describes taking delight in the disasters of others -lrb- which requires at least five words in english to express -rrb- , the germans themselves do n't seem to feel much of it . the study was commissioned by the hamburg-based magazine young care and surveyed 2,639 people aged between 16 and 72 years of age . while germans do n't much like to laugh at themselves , they do find comedy programs on television particularly funny - 68 percent said they can have a good chuckle while watching sitcoms , sketch shows or other comedy formats . one in two said their partners provided reasons to laugh while 44 percent laughed about jokes and 38 per cent found comedy films amusing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution .

" we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.08.2007 big spenders bayern tipped to win bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies will pay stuttgart fans 10:1 if the team repeats its 2006-07 title win ask the experts or bookies and the bundesliga season has already been decided .
bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .
can success be bought ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new players luca toni and franck ribery are eagerly awaited by munich fans what the bavarians will be able to do when luca toni , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are back in the line-up convinced 16 bundesliga coaches to name bayern favorites for the league title .
bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .
can success be bought ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new players luca toni and franck ribery are eagerly awaited by munich fans what the bavarians will be able to do when luca toni , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are back in the line-up convinced 16 bundesliga coaches to name bayern favorites for the league title .
bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .
stuttgart 's chances of repeating their win last season will pay punters 10-to-one , but the team ca n't be written off until the end of the season after grabbing last year 's title from schalke in the final two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i do n't care if i 'm the only one , i want it all on duisburg but diehard cottbus , rostock or duisburg fans would earn 1,000 euros for putting one down on their team .

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .

and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .
some 16,000 nato-led troops are currently stationed in kosovo , in charge of security in the region . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .

" but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .

" many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .

recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany .

" change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .
turning appliances completely off , rather than to just " stand-by " mode , can help save one household around 115 euros -lrb- $ 157 -rrb- a year . peter hille -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .
customers are neither happy with their prices , nor with the source of energy these companies use . going green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel had climate change on her agenda as eu president since the liberalization of the german energy sector in 1998 , the green party has encouraged people to switch to more ecologically oriented providers . however , the dominant position of the big four players , who rely mainly on energy from nuclear and fossil fuel sources , has largely gone unchallenged . now , even the director of the federal cartel office , bernhard heitzer , has begun appealing to germans to think about changing to a smaller provider . gerd billen , director of the association of german consumers , said consumers are heeding the call . " many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .
" they want to do something and not wait until government or companies take action . " switching to so-called eco-electricity providers means consumers can help reduce their co2 emissions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people taking green action in brussels this year a wide range of green power providers have sprung up like mushrooms on the german market . they provide power generated from renewable sources such as wind , water and the sun .
a fear of nuclear accidents and difficulties with nuclear waste disposal have also driven more germans away from nuclear energy .
recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany . " a lot is changing in the united states as well , " he said .
" awareness about climate change is growing and consumers are asking what they can do to slow the harmful effects of climate change . " awareness is also growing in the united kingdom , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar is a renewable energy source the association of german consumers has just started a new campaign to encourage even more people to change their power provider . posters for the campaign display pictures of electrical sockets on walls which look like monsters , with sharp teeth and a greedy mouth .

berlin , dresden and the neuschwanstein castle also scored well . visitors exiting cologne 's main train station can often be caught craning their necks , jaws open , as they catch a glimpse of the city 's cathedral , towering 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- above them .
it 's no wonder that 15.2 percent of participants in a recent survey selected the gothic structure as their favorite tourist destination .
the capital city also scored well in the survey , which was conducted by the german tourism association and the web site meinestadt.de.
four berlin sites - the brandenburg gate , the television tower , the reichstag , and the city as a whole - made the top 15 .
dresden , germany 's eastern gem , also proved popular among germans .
the church of our lady , which underwent renovation in 2005 , took third place , while the semper oper placed 41st .
for many outside the country , the oktoberfest is synonymous with germany .
but how did the bavarian beer bash fair with the 3,000 german survey participants ?
it came in at 11 - not bad , but perhaps not quite as well as it would have in a survey of non-germans .

thirteen percent of germen men and just five percent of german women think there 's something funny about other people 's troubles . so although german has one word - schadenfreude - that perfectly describes taking delight in the disasters of others -lrb- which requires at least five words in english to express -rrb- , the germans themselves do n't seem to feel much of it . the study was commissioned by the hamburg-based magazine young care and surveyed 2,639 people aged between 16 and 72 years of age . while germans do n't much like to laugh at themselves , they do find comedy programs on television particularly funny - 68 percent said they can have a good chuckle while watching sitcoms , sketch shows or other comedy formats . one in two said their partners provided reasons to laugh while 44 percent laughed about jokes and 38 per cent found comedy films amusing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .
life-long effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's authorities want to easily control who pays for refugees many of germany 's 16 states require refugees and others protected from deportation who receive welfare benefits to make their homes in the state , district , county or even municipality that issued their residence permits .
the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .
it could limit their employment opportunities and harm their familial or social lives , the agency said , such as in cases where those affected fell ill or had to deal with traumatic events without being able to live near family or fellow countrymen or -women . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2007 soccer powers to increase bundesliga doping controls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more common than thought ?
former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.08.2007 big spenders bayern tipped to win bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies will pay stuttgart fans 10:1 if the team repeats its 2006-07 title win ask the experts or bookies and the bundesliga season has already been decided .
bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .
can success be bought ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new players luca toni and franck ribery are eagerly awaited by munich fans what the bavarians will be able to do when luca toni , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are back in the line-up convinced 16 bundesliga coaches to name bayern favorites for the league title .
bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .
stuttgart 's chances of repeating their win last season will pay punters 10-to-one , but the team ca n't be written off until the end of the season after grabbing last year 's title from schalke in the final two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i do n't care if i 'm the only one , i want it all on duisburg but diehard cottbus , rostock or duisburg fans would earn 1,000 euros for putting one down on their team .
yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .
new names to learn even if the final outcome is clear , there are enough new faces coming into the bundesliga to make the 2007-08 season worth watching , like munich wunderkind wagner .
the 120 players getting their introduction with new teams in the german first division , including half the league 's starting goalkeepers , are hoping to surprise germany 's soccer experts and give fans the spectacle they 're hoping for .
" after such a long pre-season , you 're just delighted it is starting again for real , " said bayern and germany defender philipp lahm , summing up german soccer fans ' excitement about the season that kicks off this weekend . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .
can success be bought ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new players luca toni and franck ribery are eagerly awaited by munich fans what the bavarians will be able to do when luca toni , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are back in the line-up convinced 16 bundesliga coaches to name bayern favorites for the league title .
bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .
stuttgart 's chances of repeating their win last season will pay punters 10-to-one , but the team ca n't be written off until the end of the season after grabbing last year 's title from schalke in the final two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i do n't care if i 'm the only one , i want it all on duisburg but diehard cottbus , rostock or duisburg fans would earn 1,000 euros for putting one down on their team .
yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .
new names to learn even if the final outcome is clear , there are enough new faces coming into the bundesliga to make the 2007-08 season worth watching , like munich wunderkind wagner .
the 120 players getting their introduction with new teams in the german first division , including half the league 's starting goalkeepers , are hoping to surprise germany 's soccer experts and give fans the spectacle they 're hoping for .
" after such a long pre-season , you 're just delighted it is starting again for real , " said bayern and germany defender philipp lahm , summing up german soccer fans ' excitement about the season that kicks off this weekend . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.08.2007 big spenders bayern tipped to win bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies will pay stuttgart fans 10:1 if the team repeats its 2006-07 title win ask the experts or bookies and the bundesliga season has already been decided .
bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .
can success be bought ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new players luca toni and franck ribery are eagerly awaited by munich fans what the bavarians will be able to do when luca toni , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are back in the line-up convinced 16 bundesliga coaches to name bayern favorites for the league title .
bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .
stuttgart 's chances of repeating their win last season will pay punters 10-to-one , but the team ca n't be written off until the end of the season after grabbing last year 's title from schalke in the final two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i do n't care if i 'm the only one , i want it all on duisburg but diehard cottbus , rostock or duisburg fans would earn 1,000 euros for putting one down on their team .
yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .
new names to learn even if the final outcome is clear , there are enough new faces coming into the bundesliga to make the 2007-08 season worth watching , like munich wunderkind wagner .
the 120 players getting their introduction with new teams in the german first division , including half the league 's starting goalkeepers , are hoping to surprise germany 's soccer experts and give fans the spectacle they 're hoping for .
" after such a long pre-season , you 're just delighted it is starting again for real , " said bayern and germany defender philipp lahm , summing up german soccer fans ' excitement about the season that kicks off this weekend . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole germany 's raf prison bombers identified 14 years later terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2007 former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she might not be mohnhaupt for long brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which committed a series of murders in the 1970s , has asked for a new identity .
germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .

" but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .
part of the reason for the denial was a statement he written for a marxist meeting in berlin that called for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims .

it was the largest direct intervention in the frankfurt-based central bank 's history .
" this liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation follows up on the operation conducted yesterday and aims to assure orderly conditions in the euro money market , " the ecb said in a statement released friday .
the three-day " fine-tuning " operation was aimed at maintaining short-term rate stability after overnight rates banks charge each other to lend dollars reached six-year highs .

sweden is coming under pressure to name the collaborators . sweden investigated 50 people during the 1990s for possible links to the east german secret police , although fewer than a dozen have been identified as agents who worked for the stasi , according to an investigation by the swedish security police , or sapo .
now swedish authorities have come under new pressure to release the names of swedish citizens suspected of working for the gdr 's secret service agency .
swedish media recently became interested after a book claimed that sapo kept a list of suspected stasi informers and journalists have requested the list be released . however , the agency has insisted that the information is classified .
" we 've investigated these cases thoroughly , " sapo spokesman anders thornberg said . prosecution unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files show the extent of the espionage fewer than 10 of the people have been identified as stasi agents , thornberg said .
the swedish media has reported that the stasi had agents reporting on the swedish prime minister as well as on the workings of sweden 's west german embassy .

the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .

the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .
part of the reason for the denial was a statement he written for a marxist meeting in berlin that called for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims .

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .
life-long effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's authorities want to easily control who pays for refugees many of germany 's 16 states require refugees and others protected from deportation who receive welfare benefits to make their homes in the state , district , county or even municipality that issued their residence permits .
the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .
it could limit their employment opportunities and harm their familial or social lives , the agency said , such as in cases where those affected fell ill or had to deal with traumatic events without being able to live near family or fellow countrymen or -women . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .
customers are neither happy with their prices , nor with the source of energy these companies use . going green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel had climate change on her agenda as eu president since the liberalization of the german energy sector in 1998 , the green party has encouraged people to switch to more ecologically oriented providers . however , the dominant position of the big four players , who rely mainly on energy from nuclear and fossil fuel sources , has largely gone unchallenged . now , even the director of the federal cartel office , bernhard heitzer , has begun appealing to germans to think about changing to a smaller provider . gerd billen , director of the association of german consumers , said consumers are heeding the call . " many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .
" they want to do something and not wait until government or companies take action . " switching to so-called eco-electricity providers means consumers can help reduce their co2 emissions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people taking green action in brussels this year a wide range of green power providers have sprung up like mushrooms on the german market . they provide power generated from renewable sources such as wind , water and the sun .
a fear of nuclear accidents and difficulties with nuclear waste disposal have also driven more germans away from nuclear energy .
recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany . " a lot is changing in the united states as well , " he said .
" awareness about climate change is growing and consumers are asking what they can do to slow the harmful effects of climate change . " awareness is also growing in the united kingdom , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar is a renewable energy source the association of german consumers has just started a new campaign to encourage even more people to change their power provider . posters for the campaign display pictures of electrical sockets on walls which look like monsters , with sharp teeth and a greedy mouth . " change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .
turning appliances completely off , rather than to just " stand-by " mode , can help save one household around 115 euros -lrb- $ 157 -rrb- a year . peter hille -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin , dresden and the neuschwanstein castle also scored well . visitors exiting cologne 's main train station can often be caught craning their necks , jaws open , as they catch a glimpse of the city 's cathedral , towering 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- above them .
it 's no wonder that 15.2 percent of participants in a recent survey selected the gothic structure as their favorite tourist destination .
the capital city also scored well in the survey , which was conducted by the german tourism association and the web site meinestadt.de.
four berlin sites - the brandenburg gate , the television tower , the reichstag , and the city as a whole - made the top 15 .
dresden , germany 's eastern gem , also proved popular among germans .
the church of our lady , which underwent renovation in 2005 , took third place , while the semper oper placed 41st .
for many outside the country , the oktoberfest is synonymous with germany .

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .

yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .
new names to learn even if the final outcome is clear , there are enough new faces coming into the bundesliga to make the 2007-08 season worth watching , like munich wunderkind wagner .
the 120 players getting their introduction with new teams in the german first division , including half the league 's starting goalkeepers , are hoping to surprise germany 's soccer experts and give fans the spectacle they 're hoping for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2007 soccer powers to increase bundesliga doping controls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more common than thought ?
former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .
computer digital programming and design has brought amazing possibilities for design as you can see all over the world .
people are more conscious of architecture - they 're more willing to take risks .
we 've never had a better moment in architecture than we have today . how do you view german architecture today ? there 's some very good , young firms and there have been some wonderful firms in the past : egon heinemann , joseph paul kleihues and -lrb- oswald -rrb- matthias ungers , sauerbruch hutton , terrani , gerkan , marg and partner .
there are lots of firms who do fabulous work in germany .
i think german architecture is very good and the climate for architecture is very positive in germany . you 'll be celebrating your 75th birthday on august 11 .
will you be thinking about retirement ? no , i 'm not going to retire .
i have an undated contract with yale university to teach .
i have lots of things i want to do in architecture – both in writing and building .

one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .

" but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing .

one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .

" but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing .

she can prove her earnestness soon as she tries to recruit allies in china and japan this month . " we need a successor arrangement for the time after 2012 , " chancellor merkel told the süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily , adding that she was going to apply herself forcefully to bringing one about .
the kyoto protocol , which sets specific targets for reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
with the notable exception of the united states , most of the world 's industrialized countries have signed up to the treaty .
" over the coming months , i want to contribute to it being possible to work out the new global framework for climate protection at the climate conference in bali , " merkel said , referring to the un-sponsored negotiations on a new global climate change agreement that will take place in december on the indonesian island .

at the june summit in heiligendamm , germany , the world 's most industrialized countries agreed to begin talks by the end of the year on a treaty that could take the place of the kyoto protocol .

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .
computer digital programming and design has brought amazing possibilities for design as you can see all over the world .
people are more conscious of architecture - they 're more willing to take risks .
we 've never had a better moment in architecture than we have today . how do you view german architecture today ? there 's some very good , young firms and there have been some wonderful firms in the past : egon heinemann , joseph paul kleihues and -lrb- oswald -rrb- matthias ungers , sauerbruch hutton , terrani , gerkan , marg and partner .
there are lots of firms who do fabulous work in germany .
i think german architecture is very good and the climate for architecture is very positive in germany . you 'll be celebrating your 75th birthday on august 11 .
will you be thinking about retirement ? no , i 'm not going to retire .
i have an undated contract with yale university to teach .
i have lots of things i want to do in architecture – both in writing and building .
i have n't built a tall building yet .
i would have liked to have built the -lrb- max -rrb- reinhardt haus -lrb- in berlin -rrb- but i was n't able to .
so i got a lot of things to do . stephanie raison interviewed peter eisenman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former australian player stan lazaridis tested positive for a medicine which can mask banned products german soccer players get tested for illegal substances less than their counterparts in cycling and athletics .
despite a relatively clean doping record , german soccer and anti-doping powers are not taking any chances . when oliver kahn flew into a rage in march this year after being ordered to provide a second post-match urine sample , the bayern munich goalkeeper later claimed that he had been annoyed at being singled out again for the testing procedure .
while he was proven clean after his fit of pique , kahn still violated a number of doping control rules in the wake of the champions league qualifier against real madrid , for which he served a one-game ban .
however , given the facts about dope testing in soccer , olli could have been excused for feeling a little persecuted .
in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in relation to other sports , german soccer players have it easy when it comes to being tested for doping . in 2006 , doping controllers from germany ’ s national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- visited the 36 top-flight bundesliga clubs during training sessions 87 times ; that 's just 2.4 visits per club .
statistics show that out of 900 registered players in the bundesliga , just 174 were tested " out of competition " in 2006 .
that compares to 886 tests " in competition , " which refers to testing after matches .
no positive tests were recorded in either category in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : " nada , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- are in discussions about this discrepancy at the moment , nada 's ulrike spitz told dw-world.de.
" all parties have agreed that there must be more ' out of competition ' controls in soccer in the future .
the number of ' in competition ' controls is really good , but there are not enough tests in training .
and that will be modified soon . "
other athletes tested more in comparison to soccer players , top track-and-field athletes are tested at between four and six training sessions per year .
a top athlete can be tested 15 times a year in total .
when a soccer player is tested four times in a year , both in and out of competition , that is regarded a lot .
so oliver kahn may have been justified in throwing his weight about after being singled out again the statistics on doping control in the bundesliga suggest that many players go a whole season without being presented a plastic beaker .
and while the numbers of soccer players actually being caught taking illegal substances in the bundesliga since controls were introduced in 1988 is remarkably low , one has to wonder whether it is because doping does not take place or that the holes in the net are too large .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controls are going to be stepped up in the bundesliga with cycling reeling from its latest series of high-profile doping scandals and athletics still producing a steady flow of drug cheats , the dfb is not taking any chances .
the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dfb , dfl and nada are all racing to agree on a stricter regime of doping controls for the 2007/08 bundesliga season which just kicked off on august 10 .
after a dfb seminar on the topic last month , officials from the three organizations agreed that the doping checks in the bundesliga should be more in line with those which take place in athletics .
under the preliminary plans for the coming season , the 36 bundesliga clubs will be required to inform nada by fax or email every friday when and where their players will be training in the next week .
as well as the standard urine tests , the dfb , dfl and nada hope to introduce blood testing to the procedure in a bid to detect the use of anabolic steroids or erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
european soccer 's governing body uefa also wants to include these blood tests in its checks at the 2008 european championships .
likely drugs anabolic steroids and epo are the most likely substances to be used by anyone doping in soccer .
erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells .
the resultant increase in red blood cells increases the blood 's oxygen-carrying capacity and increases stamina .
anabolic steroids would promote increased muscle growth during these periods of increased , epo-enhanced activities .
both would be administered in the training phase .
it was also agreed that , in addition to the usual training visitations and post-match testing , soccer players must make themselves available for testing at all times , even when on vacation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping control room in berlin 's olympic stadium during the soccer world cup in 2006 while the increase in the number , type and frequency of controls can only be lauded as a step in the right direction , some experts see these efforts as an example of shutting the stable door after the chemically enhanced horse has bolted .
questions have arisen as to why anti-doping measures now , some 20 years after controls were introduced , are being stepped-up .
is there any increased threat or is it just a symbolic act ?
" it is not only a symbolic act , " said nada 's spitz .
" a lot of things are happening because of the doping discussion at the moment .
everybody has accepted that there is a problem in sport , not only in cycling .
" nada has never excluded any sport from the doping control system but we do have to organize the controls in adequate quantities , " she added .
" in the case of the bundesliga , all the parties involved agree that there are not enough ' out of competition ' controls at the moment and all the parties want to improve the system as quickly as possible . "
murky past ?
there have been only four positive doping tests in the bundesliga since nada was established in 2003 - as many in four years of soccer as in one tour de france .
but while many within the game have made strong assertions that soccer is clean apart from these very few exceptions , others have suggested the bundesliga has a murkier past than most would like to admit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter neururer there have been recent claims and admissions hinting at a doping culture in the bundesliga before controls were introduced in 1988 .
former schalke 04 coach peter neururer issued a written statement to the dfb two weeks ago stating that around 50 percent of his players used captagon , along with other stimulants like ephedrine , some as recently as the early 90 's .
his assistant at schalke , michael krüger , also admitted seeing players use the drug and even took it himself as an 18-year old .
the first player to get caught after the controls were brought in was roland wohlfarth in 1995 .
the vfl bochum striker was found to have taken the stimulant norephedrin .
since wohlfarth 's positive test , 14 players in total have tested positive for doping in the first and second league .
the dfb-led discussions will come to a conclusion at the end of august when a new regime of testing and financing will be agreed on .
all three organizations agree that more money is needed , as well as more tests .
with sponsors and media companies responsible for much of the wealth in soccer , all agree that any increased funding would be money well spent . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now swedish authorities have come under new pressure to release the names of swedish citizens suspected of working for the gdr 's secret service agency .
swedish media recently became interested after a book claimed that sapo kept a list of suspected stasi informers and journalists have requested the list be released . however , the agency has insisted that the information is classified .
" we 've investigated these cases thoroughly , " sapo spokesman anders thornberg said . prosecution unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files show the extent of the espionage fewer than 10 of the people have been identified as stasi agents , thornberg said .
the swedish media has reported that the stasi had agents reporting on the swedish prime minister as well as on the workings of sweden 's west german embassy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 10.08.2007 no plans to retire as star architect peter eisenman turns 75 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eisenman says he 'd love to add a tall building to his projects peter eisenman , who designed berlin 's holocaust memorial , turns 75 on saturday .
the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .
computer digital programming and design has brought amazing possibilities for design as you can see all over the world .
people are more conscious of architecture - they 're more willing to take risks .
we 've never had a better moment in architecture than we have today . how do you view german architecture today ? there 's some very good , young firms and there have been some wonderful firms in the past : egon heinemann , joseph paul kleihues and -lrb- oswald -rrb- matthias ungers , sauerbruch hutton , terrani , gerkan , marg and partner .
there are lots of firms who do fabulous work in germany .
i think german architecture is very good and the climate for architecture is very positive in germany . you 'll be celebrating your 75th birthday on august 11 .
will you be thinking about retirement ? no , i 'm not going to retire .
i have an undated contract with yale university to teach .
i have lots of things i want to do in architecture – both in writing and building .

the star architect talked to dw-world.de about germany 's positive climate for architecture and future projects . peter eisenman is an internationally recognized architect and educator perhaps best known for the memorial to the murdered jews of europe -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- in berlin .
he began his career as an educator and theorist before establishing his practice in 1980 .
eisenman is the recipient of numerous awards , including the 2004 golden lion for lifetime achievement by the international architectural biennale in venice .
he is currently the louis i. kahn professor of architecture at yale university and is working on the city of culture of galicia , spain and two commuter train stations near pompeii , italy . dw-world.de : the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin is the project for which you have received the most media attention , especially in germany .
what has been your experience working in germany and with germans ? peter eisenman : i 've never had a better experience .
for me it was a great honor to be chosen to do the -lsb- the holocaust memorial in berlin -rsb- .
i think it was an important project , the kind of project that every architect would like to be able to do . germans are very precise , they know what they want , they make decisions , they get things done on time , as opposed to other countries where we work .
we 've had nothing but a good experience . i hate to see suddenly negative things coming in to destroy the positive feedback that we 've had come in from all walks of life in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists at the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin the memorial is currently in the news again because cracks were discovered in the concrete . we 've known about these cracks .
they 're hairline cracks ; they 're less than one millimeter .
concrete does show cracks in extreme weather conditions .
we 're working to take care of it .
i do n't think it 's a big problem , but we are paying attention to it . t alking about your work more broadly , experimentation seems to be a constant element in your projects . as a teacher , how do you encourage students to continue to experiment ? you do n't have to encourage young people in architecture too much because that 's why they 're in architecture .
they 're not in it to make money - they 're in it to do things of some cultural , social and moral value .
when you 've worked as long and as hard as we have , it 's great to get the projects that allow one to take risks .
all you tell your students is that it takes time .
it 's not a young person 's game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial is there still unknown territory to be explored in the world of architecture ? there 's always unknown territory .
computer digital programming and design has brought amazing possibilities for design as you can see all over the world .
people are more conscious of architecture - they 're more willing to take risks .
we 've never had a better moment in architecture than we have today . how do you view german architecture today ? there 's some very good , young firms and there have been some wonderful firms in the past : egon heinemann , joseph paul kleihues and -lrb- oswald -rrb- matthias ungers , sauerbruch hutton , terrani , gerkan , marg and partner .
there are lots of firms who do fabulous work in germany .
i think german architecture is very good and the climate for architecture is very positive in germany . you 'll be celebrating your 75th birthday on august 11 .
will you be thinking about retirement ? no , i 'm not going to retire .
i have an undated contract with yale university to teach .
i have lots of things i want to do in architecture – both in writing and building .
i have n't built a tall building yet .
i would have liked to have built the -lrb- max -rrb- reinhardt haus -lrb- in berlin -rrb- but i was n't able to .
so i got a lot of things to do . stephanie raison interviewed peter eisenman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a successor arrangement for the time after 2012 , " chancellor merkel told the süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily , adding that she was going to apply herself forcefully to bringing one about .
the kyoto protocol , which sets specific targets for reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
with the notable exception of the united states , most of the world 's industrialized countries have signed up to the treaty .
" over the coming months , i want to contribute to it being possible to work out the new global framework for climate protection at the climate conference in bali , " merkel said , referring to the un-sponsored negotiations on a new global climate change agreement that will take place in december on the indonesian island .

at the june summit in heiligendamm , germany , the world 's most industrialized countries agreed to begin talks by the end of the year on a treaty that could take the place of the kyoto protocol .

it was the largest direct intervention in the frankfurt-based central bank 's history .
" this liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation follows up on the operation conducted yesterday and aims to assure orderly conditions in the euro money market , " the ecb said in a statement released friday .
the three-day " fine-tuning " operation was aimed at maintaining short-term rate stability after overnight rates banks charge each other to lend dollars reached six-year highs .

inter-bank rates friday were as much as 0.27 percent over the ecb 's benchmark of 4 percent .

it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .

" but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .
but how much a company actually spends to that end is often not publicly announced .

berlin , dresden and the neuschwanstein castle also scored well . visitors exiting cologne 's main train station can often be caught craning their necks , jaws open , as they catch a glimpse of the city 's cathedral , towering 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- above them .
it 's no wonder that 15.2 percent of participants in a recent survey selected the gothic structure as their favorite tourist destination .
the capital city also scored well in the survey , which was conducted by the german tourism association and the web site meinestadt.de.
four berlin sites - the brandenburg gate , the television tower , the reichstag , and the city as a whole - made the top 15 .
dresden , germany 's eastern gem , also proved popular among germans .
the church of our lady , which underwent renovation in 2005 , took third place , while the semper oper placed 41st .
for many outside the country , the oktoberfest is synonymous with germany .
but how did the bavarian beer bash fair with the 3,000 german survey participants ?
it came in at 11 - not bad , but perhaps not quite as well as it would have in a survey of non-germans .

the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .

the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .
life-long effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's authorities want to easily control who pays for refugees many of germany 's 16 states require refugees and others protected from deportation who receive welfare benefits to make their homes in the state , district , county or even municipality that issued their residence permits .
the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .
it could limit their employment opportunities and harm their familial or social lives , the agency said , such as in cases where those affected fell ill or had to deal with traumatic events without being able to live near family or fellow countrymen or -women . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization said the practice violated international and european law . the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement friday that germany 's states contravened the geneva refugee convention and other human rights treaties , including the european convention on human rights , as well as breaching eu legislation .
the refugee convention only allows authorities to restrict freedom of movement , if the regulation applies to all foreigners issued with a particular residence permit , but this was not the case , the unhcr said .
the european human rights convention requires narrowly defined conditions to justify such a restriction , such as to maintain public order , to prevent crime or to protect people 's health , the agency added .

the restrictions are meant to control who is responsible for welfare benefits , some of which are paid by local authorities , and prevent the costs from shifting to other localities .
the unhcr said that restricting freedom of movement could have a profound , even life-long , effect on people .
it could limit their employment opportunities and harm their familial or social lives , the agency said , such as in cases where those affected fell ill or had to deal with traumatic events without being able to live near family or fellow countrymen or -women . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern will win , and six teams will fight to avoid the final three relegation spots .
still , fans are streaming into stadiums for good reason . legendary german national team coach sepp herberger 's adage that people go to stadiums to see soccer games because they do n't know which team will win rings rather hollow in the bundesliga this season .
the german top flight has seldom had such as clear favorite as bayern munich .
the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95.7 million -rrb- the team is rumored to have paid to pull in international stars paid an initial dividend when bayern won germany 's pre-season league cup .
by comparison , the league 's 17 other teams are reported to have paid a total of 100 million euros for new players .
bayern 's stars left the bundesliga 's other teams watching in wonder as franck ribery , hamit altintop and ze roberto passed the ball through the midfield and 19-year-old striker sandro wagner , who had four regional league goals to his name , kept ahead of the league 's top defenders .

bayer leverkusen 's michael skibbe said he thought bremen would win and the league 's final trainer dieter hecking of hanover placed his bet on perennial runners-up schalke finally winning their first title in 50 years .
but money does n't guarantee success , which munich painfully learnt on monday when they needed penalty shootout heroics from their 38-year-old captain oliver kahn to beat third division burghausen in the german cup .
bookies bet on bayern though loyal fans will be glad to see the league trophy return to munich , if they put their money behind their team there wo n't be a new car or trip to disney world at the end of the season .
bookmakers are paying just 1.50 to one .
bremen fans have odds of 6.50 to one , schalke 's are nine-to-one .
stuttgart 's chances of repeating their win last season will pay punters 10-to-one , but the team ca n't be written off until the end of the season after grabbing last year 's title from schalke in the final two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i do n't care if i 'm the only one , i want it all on duisburg but diehard cottbus , rostock or duisburg fans would earn 1,000 euros for putting one down on their team .
yes , it sounds outlandish now , but it was just 10 years ago that kaiserslautern were promoted to the first division and won the league in the same year .
still , experts agree it 's more likely this season 's promoted sides , karlsruhe , duisburg and rostock , will be playing to avoid relegation along with bielefeld , bochum and cottbus .
new names to learn even if the final outcome is clear , there are enough new faces coming into the bundesliga to make the 2007-08 season worth watching , like munich wunderkind wagner .
the 120 players getting their introduction with new teams in the german first division , including half the league 's starting goalkeepers , are hoping to surprise germany 's soccer experts and give fans the spectacle they 're hoping for .

" we had the opportunity to explain in detail the purpose , the scope and the mandate of our mission , " ischinger said .
" this is the beginning of a process that will lead us into december . " likely the final chance for a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger represents the european union in the kosovo talks but the german diplomat also said the troika would likely be the final chance to resolve the kosovo issue .
the mediators " are offering belgrade and pristina another opportunity , maybe the last opportunity , to work out a negotiated solution , " he told the bbc . " if there 's success , it will be their success .
if there 's failure , it will be their failure , " he added . the troika is scheduled to report its findings to the united nations by dec .
10 .
after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution . " ' no stone unturned ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians demand " self determination " as the graffiti says troika diplomats said they were determined to find a compromise both kosovar and serbian leaders would accept . " we will leave no stone unturned in trying to find a solution to the kosovo status question and all other related problems , " wisner told belgrade reporters . botsan-kharchenko reiterated russia 's ongoing stance that it supports a solution based on a compromise between belgrade and pristina . the three envoys are scheduled to meet kosovo-albanian leaders in pristina saturday , where a similar introductory discussion was expected to take place .
kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

after that , barring an unexpected compromise , a solution would be imposed along the roadmap laid out by the un mediator in the previous , failed talks , martti ahtisaari .
russia , however , has pushed for the talks to remain open-ended . after some 13 months of negotiations , ahtisaari envisaged supervised independence for kosovo , enraging serbia , which angrily rejected his document as a legal violation aimed at dismembering a recognized country . serbia has however yet not produced a viable counterproposal but said friday in a statement that the newest talks would " pave the way for reaching a compromise solution .

kosovo prime minister agim ceku stated that the albanian negotiation team would present its platform for the talks to the international envoys on saturday . thus far , the form and schedule of the talks was apparently not agreed on in advance and the outlook is grim as belgrade adamantly insists on sovereignty over the hostile kosovo , while the increasingly impatient majority of albanians there want nothing less than independence . " we can discuss for 120 months , or 120 years and again we will come to the same point and that is : we want independence and serbia is against it , " said veton surroi , one of kosovo 's albanian negotiators . sovereignty would allow pristina access to international lending institutions and crack open doors to the recovery of the moribund economy instead of relying on aid . russia halted un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled their homes in 1999 ahtisaari 's plan was blocked in the united nations by russia , which strongly backed serbia 's position . moscow said it would only support a solution accepted by both sides and its diplomats dismissed ahtisaari 's plan as " dead " ahead of the new round of talks . the eu , which has said it would take over for the un in kosovo with a mission that would provide the province with " supervised independence , " wants the upcoming talks to be based on the reality that serbia has not controlled kosovo over the past eight years , ischinger said ahead of the belgrade visit . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato intervention put a stop to a serbian crackdown on the kosovo albanian separatist movement .

they are increasingly trying to cut down on their carbon footprints by switching to green power . at the g8 summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm this past june , german chancellor angela merkel put measures for reducing co2 emissions at the top of the agenda . the heads of government of the largest industrialized countries agreed to reduce their co2 emissions to help fight global warming , but for many people in society , that is not enough . many germans , too , think they should be taking action in their own daily lives and since the beginning of this year , more than three million of them have changed their electricity provider . the four big energy companies rwe , vattenfall , en-bw and e-on are the biggest losers in this development .

" many consumers are concerned about climate change , " said billen .

recent accidents at two german nuclear power plants have reinforced this trend . some green power providers said they have had thousands of new customers knocking on their doors since the accidents . beyond borders billen , however , said that consumer awareness for green power is not only limited to germany .

" change now " is the slogan . the six-month campaign aims to prompt around one million households to change to green power providers - not only to help save the planet , but also to save money .
currently , about 2.5 million , or six percent , of german households have tapped into green energy . billen said a normal household can save around 60 euros -lrb- $ 82 -rrb- a year by switching to green power ; family households can save an average of 185 euros . billen also had another piece of advice : consumers can simply cut down on consumption and save on the juice coming out of the electrical socket .

but who is it really helping ? what do audi and haydn have in common ?
one would think not much .
audi has a different opinion on the matter , however .
the automaker has come to the rescue of the salzburg festival - one of europe 's biggest summer music and drama events - and become its main sponsor .
it 's a fortunate move since festival organizers now only receive enough public funds to cover about 30 percent of their costs . the rest must be covered through entrance fees and , even more important , private sponsors . manfred schwaiger , an economics professor at the university of munich , said , however , that audi is not merely being benevolent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg star veronica ferres " it 's a very straight-forward deal : money for benefits , and in this case , the benefit is that a sponsor is associated with an artist or a cultural event , " he said . matches with a message how the two sides come together , however , largely depends on the company 's brand . the deutsche bank , for instance , wants to stress its tradition and discriminating taste by supporting the berlin philharmonic .
by sponsoring the art exhibition " documenta " in kassel , germany 's group of state-owned banks - the sparkassen-finanzgruppe - wants to appear trendy and cutting edge . the arbeitskkreis kultursponsoring - an association to promote cultural sponsoring relationships - estimates that sponsors spend around 350 million euros each year on cultural projects and programs .
when funds from private foundations are added in , the total comes to around 600 million euros . the number of private sponsors of cultural projects in germany , however , is minimal compared to the united states . different tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring performers at a henry purcell opera in salzburg in germany , about 90 percent of funding for cultural programs comes from public funds , while in the us , it is only about 10 percent . part of the reason for that , said schwaiger , is different tax incentives for cultural sponsoring in the two countries . " but there 's another reason : in germany , people still expect the government to come to the rescue , also for cultural projects , " he said . stefan frucht , of the cultural committee of german business , sees a clear trend : " generally speaking , public funding of cultural projects is decreasing while funding from private companies is increasing . " most cultural funding goes toward visual art and various music projects .
frucht said that literature and architecture programs are also sometimes sponsored . employee satisfaction other companies , such as consulting firms roland berger or kpmg , envision more than just benevolence for the public or more business from clients when they supports projects such as the world-famous dresden staatskapelle -lrb- orchestra -rrb- . ultimately , charitable companies are also viewed positively by their employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salzburg was home to mozart " cultural sponsoring does not necessarily lead to more motivated employees , but if a company is not a sponsor , it may lead to more employee dissatisfaction , " said frucht . whether it 's for employees , customers or to serve the greater good , companies who sponsor cultural projects promote it through press conferences , advertising and events .
but how much a company actually spends to that end is often not publicly announced . " it 's a success when a company spends ' x ' amount on cultural programs and journalists speculate that twice that ' x ' amount was spent , " said schwaiger . richard fuchs -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's most notorious terrorist was paroled in march . mohnhaupt , 57 , spent 24 years in prison for the role she played in raf , a left-wing group which launched a campaign of terror against the west german state in the 1970s .
now she wants to change her identity to avoid publicity .
mohnhaupt reportedly lives in southern germany and will work at a factory that produced automobile parts .
the group which is helping mohnhaupt settle into life outside prison said she wants a " new start , " according to the newspaper bild .
the german media has closely followed her case and her parole this spring remains controversial . terrorist campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf is blamed for 34 deaths the raf 's campaign reached its bloody high point in the so-called german autumn in 1977 .
the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .

the group kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants .
the raf is believed to have killed 34 people during its existence .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany .
in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 .
while mohnhaupt is no longer considered a threat , the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , in part because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders .
few raf members still behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohnhaupt 's crimes continue to generate interest she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ensslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three remain behind bars , including christian klar , who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar had applied for clemency from german president horst köhler , but was refused in may .
part of the reason for the denial was a statement he written for a marxist meeting in berlin that called for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims .

sponsor edward huniehu said he dropped the motion because the government was challenging it in the courts .
the vote , the second mr sogavare would have faced , was triggered by the controversial appointment of julian moti as attorney general .
mr moti is wanted in australia to face child sex charges .
mr huniehu said he would wait for the courts to decide whether his motion was legal .
" i have no intention to create animosity , acrimony and confusion by moving this motion now , " he said .
" i have decided that this motion will be deferred . "
a decision from the court is expected within eight days .
mr sogavare , for his part , said that he feared nothing .
" we welcome any moves to unseat my democratically elected government , he said .
mr sogavare 's appointment of mr moti has drawn domestic criticism and strained ties with the australian government , which wants his extradition .
security had been increased in the capital , honiara , ahead of the motion .
last year , a vote for a new government triggered rioting that left parts of honiara in ruins and forced many chinese residents to flee .

the vote , the second mr sogavare would have faced , was triggered by the controversial appointment of julian moti as attorney general .
mr moti is wanted in australia to face child sex charges .
mr huniehu said he would wait for the courts to decide whether his motion was legal .
" i have no intention to create animosity , acrimony and confusion by moving this motion now , " he said .
" i have decided that this motion will be deferred . "
a decision from the court is expected within eight days .
attorney-general julian moti has denied any wrongdoing mr sogavare , for his part , said that he feared nothing .
" we welcome any moves to unseat my democratically elected government , he said .
mr sogavare 's appointment of mr moti has drawn domestic criticism and strained ties with the australian government , which wants his extradition .
security had been increased in the capital , honiara , ahead of the motion .
last year , a vote for a new government triggered rioting that left parts of honiara in ruins and forced many chinese residents to flee .

the lords science and technology committee said the internet was now " the playground of criminals " .
the report criticised the government 's current " wild west " approach of leaving internet security up to the individual as " inefficient and unrealistic " .
a home office spokesperson said the government was examining the report and would respond shortly .
" we are firm believers in the internet .
it is a huge force for good .
but it relies on the confidence of millions of users , " said lord broers , chairman of the committee that published the personal internet security report .
" you ca n't just rely on individuals to take responsibility for their own security .
they will always be out-foxed by the bad guys . "
' true picture ' responsibility for protecting users also fell to " the it industry and the software vendors , the banks and internet traders , and the internet service providers " , he said .
but , speaking later on the bbc 's today programme , he conceded it was hard to contain the problems of the internet .
" because of the way it 's been set up , without a security level , so that people could talk to each other and have access to everybody else 's data , it 's become almost unrealistic at this stage , because criminals are moving-in in a big way , " he said .
" and they 're not the sad hacker in their back room - this is organised crime . "
the house of lords report acknowledged that there were no accurate statistics on e-crimes , but said that it was " not surprising " that public anxiety was growing .
the report cited a government survey that suggested more britons feared internet crime than burglary . "
you ca n't legislate for better internet security " lord broers send us your comments the get safe online study found 21 % of respondents felt most at risk from net crime , while 16 % worried most about being burgled .
internet crimes can include malicious hackers taking control of a pc , or online phishing scams where bogus websites are used to try to trick people into handing over confidential information , such as bank details .
commenting on the government survey , the house of lords committee said : " this raises the question whether the government needs to do more to help establish a true picture of the scale of the problem , the risks to individuals and the cost to the economy .
we believe the answer is yes . "
the lords ' report recommended a number of measures to help boost the confidence of internet users .
" the state also needs to do more to protect the public , not only the government itself , but regulators like ofcom , the police and the court system , " said lord broers .
specifically , the report called for a central system for reporting of e-crime .
in addition , it said there should be an increase in the resources available to the police and criminal justice system to catch and prosecute e-criminals .
david emm , of security firm kaspersky lab , agreed that a central unit could help .
" a wider agency can only be of benefit , if only to gauge the size of the problem , " he told the bbc news website .
" you ca n't manage something if you do n't know the scale of the problem . "
" we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet " home office spokesperson net crime fear for britons but , he said , there had been a central law enforcement agency to tackle e-crime in the past .
the national high tech crime unit was merged with the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- in april 2006 .
" i 've had concerns since then that there was n't as much of a focus on high-tech crime , " he said .
card abuse the committee recognised that the responsibility for uk net users - around 63 % of the population - did not rest solely with the government .
" you ca n't legislate for better internet security .
but the government can put in place incentives for the private sector to up their game .
and they can invest in better data protection and law enforcement , " said lord broers .
the committee suggested that a kite-mark should be set up that would identify internet service providers that guaranteed a secure service .
hackers stole nearly 45m credit card numbers from tjx hackers target tk maxx tk maxx credit card fraud in addition it said that government should encourage banks and other companies trading online to improve data security by establishing a law that would require them to notify a central authority when there was a breach .
this was important in cases , such as happened in march this year , when hackers stole the credit card details of 45 million customers of us retailer tjx , which owns tj maxx , and uk outlet tk maxx .
" potentially any one of these cards , belonging to innocent individuals , could be used online for illegal purposes in transactions relating to terrorism , or to purchase child abuse images , " the committee said .
it also said that steps should be taken to establish legal liability for damage resulting from security flaws found in hardware or software .
responding to the report , a home office spokesperson said : " the key to tackling online crime is prevention , which is why across government we are working closely with industry and law enforcement agencies to improve safety while also seeking to raise awareness to improve people 's ability to protect themselves .
" we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet and looking at what measures can be taken .
" we are grateful for the house of lords science and technology select committee 's contribution and work in investigating this important area and will look at the report carefully and respond to the committee shortly . "

the lords science and technology committee said the internet was now " the playground of criminals " .
the report criticised the government 's current " wild west " approach of leaving internet security up to the individual as " inefficient and unrealistic " .
a home office spokesperson said the government was examining the report and would respond shortly .
" we are firm believers in the internet .
it is a huge force for good .
but it relies on the confidence of millions of users , " said lord broers , chairman of the committee that published the personal internet security report .
" you ca n't just rely on individuals to take responsibility for their own security .
they will always be out-foxed by the bad guys . "
' true picture ' responsibility for protecting users also fell to " the it industry and the software vendors , the banks and internet traders , and the internet service providers " , he said .
but , speaking later on the bbc 's today programme , he conceded it was hard to contain the problems of the internet .
" because of the way it 's been set up , without a security level , so that people could talk to each other and have access to everybody else 's data , it 's become almost unrealistic at this stage , because criminals are moving-in in a big way , " he said .
" and they 're not the sad hacker in their back room - this is organised crime . "
the house of lords report acknowledged that there were no accurate statistics on e-crimes , but said that it was " not surprising " that public anxiety was growing .
the report cited a government survey that suggested more britons feared internet crime than burglary .

internet crimes can include malicious hackers taking control of a pc , or online phishing scams where bogus websites are used to try to trick people into handing over confidential information , such as bank details .
commenting on the government survey , the house of lords committee said : " this raises the question whether the government needs to do more to help establish a true picture of the scale of the problem , the risks to individuals and the cost to the economy .
we believe the answer is yes . "
the lords ' report recommended a number of measures to help boost the confidence of internet users .
" the state also needs to do more to protect the public , not only the government itself , but regulators like ofcom , the police and the court system , " said lord broers .
specifically , the report called for a central system for reporting of e-crime .
in addition , it said there should be an increase in the resources available to the police and criminal justice system to catch and prosecute e-criminals .
david emm , of security firm kaspersky lab , agreed that a central unit could help .
" a wider agency can only be of benefit , if only to gauge the size of the problem , " he told the bbc news website .
" you ca n't manage something if you do n't know the scale of the problem . "
we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet home office spokesperson net crime fear for britons but , he said , there had been a central law enforcement agency to tackle e-crime in the past .
the national high tech crime unit was merged with the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- in april 2006 .
" i 've had concerns since then that there was n't as much of a focus on high-tech crime , " he said .

" you ca n't legislate for better internet security .

and they can invest in better data protection and law enforcement , " said lord broers .
the committee suggested that a kite-mark should be set up that would identify internet service providers that guaranteed a secure service .

the lords science and technology committee said the internet was now " the playground of criminals " .
the report criticised the government 's current " wild west " approach of leaving internet security up to the individual as " inefficient and unrealistic " .
a home office spokesperson said the government was examining the report and would respond shortly .
" we are firm believers in the internet .
it is a huge force for good .
but it relies on the confidence of millions of users , " said lord broers , chairman of the committee that published the personal internet security report .
" you ca n't just rely on individuals to take responsibility for their own security .
they will always be out-foxed by the bad guys . "
' true picture ' responsibility for protecting users also fell to " the it industry and the software vendors , the banks and internet traders , and the internet service providers " , he said .
but , speaking later on the bbc 's today programme , he conceded it was hard to contain the problems of the internet .
" because of the way it 's been set up , without a security level , so that people could talk to each other and have access to everybody else 's data , it 's become almost unrealistic at this stage , because criminals are moving-in in a big way , " he said .
" and they 're not the sad hacker in their back room - this is organised crime . "
the house of lords report acknowledged that there were no accurate statistics on e-crimes , but said that it was " not surprising " that public anxiety was growing .
the report cited a government survey that suggested more britons feared internet crime than burglary .
you ca n't legislate for better internet security lord broers send us your comments the get safe online study found 21 % of respondents felt most at risk from net crime , while 16 % worried most about being burgled .
internet crimes can include malicious hackers taking control of a pc , or online phishing scams where bogus websites are used to try to trick people into handing over confidential information , such as bank details .
commenting on the government survey , the house of lords committee said : " this raises the question whether the government needs to do more to help establish a true picture of the scale of the problem , the risks to individuals and the cost to the economy .
we believe the answer is yes . "
the lords ' report recommended a number of measures to help boost the confidence of internet users .
" the state also needs to do more to protect the public , not only the government itself , but regulators like ofcom , the police and the court system , " said lord broers .
specifically , the report called for a central system for reporting of e-crime .
in addition , it said there should be an increase in the resources available to the police and criminal justice system to catch and prosecute e-criminals .
david emm , of security firm kaspersky lab , agreed that a central unit could help .
" a wider agency can only be of benefit , if only to gauge the size of the problem , " he told the bbc news website .
" you ca n't manage something if you do n't know the scale of the problem . "
we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet home office spokesperson net crime fear for britons but , he said , there had been a central law enforcement agency to tackle e-crime in the past .
the national high tech crime unit was merged with the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- in april 2006 .
" i 've had concerns since then that there was n't as much of a focus on high-tech crime , " he said .
card abuse the committee recognised that the responsibility for uk net users - around 63 % of the population - did not rest solely with the government .
" you ca n't legislate for better internet security .
but the government can put in place incentives for the private sector to up their game .
and they can invest in better data protection and law enforcement , " said lord broers .
the committee suggested that a kite-mark should be set up that would identify internet service providers that guaranteed a secure service .
hackers stole nearly 45m credit card numbers from tjx hackers target tk maxx tk maxx credit card fraud in addition it said that government should encourage banks and other companies trading online to improve data security by establishing a law that would require them to notify a central authority when there was a breach .
this was important in cases , such as happened in march this year , when hackers stole the credit card details of 45 million customers of us retailer tjx , which owns tj maxx , and uk outlet tk maxx .
" potentially any one of these cards , belonging to innocent individuals , could be used online for illegal purposes in transactions relating to terrorism , or to purchase child abuse images , " the committee said .
it also said that steps should be taken to establish legal liability for damage resulting from security flaws found in hardware or software .
responding to the report , a home office spokesperson said : " the key to tackling online crime is prevention , which is why across government we are working closely with industry and law enforcement agencies to improve safety while also seeking to raise awareness to improve people 's ability to protect themselves .
" we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet and looking at what measures can be taken .
" we are grateful for the house of lords science and technology select committee 's contribution and work in investigating this important area and will look at the report carefully and respond to the committee shortly . "

" the state also needs to do more to protect the public , not only the government itself , but regulators like ofcom , the police and the court system , " said lord broers .
specifically , the report called for a central system for reporting of e-crime .
in addition , it said there should be an increase in the resources available to the police and criminal justice system to catch and prosecute e-criminals .
david emm , of security firm kaspersky lab , agreed that a central unit could help .
" a wider agency can only be of benefit , if only to gauge the size of the problem , " he told the bbc news website .
" you ca n't manage something if you do n't know the scale of the problem . "
we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet home office spokesperson net crime fear for britons but , he said , there had been a central law enforcement agency to tackle e-crime in the past .
the national high tech crime unit was merged with the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- in april 2006 .
" i 've had concerns since then that there was n't as much of a focus on high-tech crime , " he said .
card abuse the committee recognised that the responsibility for uk net users - around 63 % of the population - did not rest solely with the government .
" you ca n't legislate for better internet security .
but the government can put in place incentives for the private sector to up their game .
and they can invest in better data protection and law enforcement , " said lord broers .
the committee suggested that a kite-mark should be set up that would identify internet service providers that guaranteed a secure service .
hackers stole nearly 45m credit card numbers from tjx hackers target tk maxx tk maxx credit card fraud in addition it said that government should encourage banks and other companies trading online to improve data security by establishing a law that would require them to notify a central authority when there was a breach .
this was important in cases , such as happened in march this year , when hackers stole the credit card details of 45 million customers of us retailer tjx , which owns tj maxx , and uk outlet tk maxx .
" potentially any one of these cards , belonging to innocent individuals , could be used online for illegal purposes in transactions relating to terrorism , or to purchase child abuse images , " the committee said .
it also said that steps should be taken to establish legal liability for damage resulting from security flaws found in hardware or software .
responding to the report , a home office spokesperson said : " the key to tackling online crime is prevention , which is why across government we are working closely with industry and law enforcement agencies to improve safety while also seeking to raise awareness to improve people 's ability to protect themselves .
" we are in discussions with the police about effectively policing the internet and looking at what measures can be taken .
" we are grateful for the house of lords science and technology select committee 's contribution and work in investigating this important area and will look at the report carefully and respond to the committee shortly . "

the day could soon come when a robot vehicle takes humans ' place as a matter of course .
scientists are focused on developing unmanned machines that can operate in the air , on the ground and under water , doing jobs where deploying people is just too dangerous .
some are already in use , such as the unmanned drones which fly over iraq and afghanistan carrying out reconnaissance for soldiers on the ground , or bomb disposal robots which disable deadly explosive devices .
others , still in the development stage , are taking advantage of smaller , lighter components and advances in computer technology to do things never imagined a decade ago .
some of the latest advances have been on show at the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- conference in washington dc .
on the ground so far the technology for unmanned ground vehicles has been the hardest to develop because of the amount of " clutter " they have to negotiate compared with those in the air or water .
but dewar donnithorne-tait , of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- , predicted that by 2050 people will only drive themselves around if they choose to do so , because it will be safer , cheaper and easier to use automated machines .
one pioneering ground vehicle on display , developed by general dynamics robotic systems , will be among the first semi-autonomous vehicles to be produced for the military .
designed for use in sensitive areas such as a large ammunition compound , the mdars machine can use data to choose its own routes , drive itself and even " talk " to the locks on bunkers to check they have not been tampered with .
infrared sensors and cameras allow it to avoid obstacles , detect intruders , inventory equipment and see if anything has moved out of place .
it can share roads with other vehicles , run for 16 hours on one tank of petrol and , unlike a person , will not be bored by routine or become complacent .
one human operator can monitor up to a dozen of the machines at a time .
jay rosenblum , of general dynamics robotic systems , said the first customer would be the us army , which has ordered six to start with .
other organisations would come on board once convinced of the " cost-effectiveness of replacing humans " , he said .
' beyond priceless ' the same semi-autonomous technology may in the future be transferred to a robust vehicle for use in combat situations , replacing current machines which must be remote controlled by human operators . "
the good thing about this system is you do n't have to send a marine out and risk that life " captain james lee one such device was displayed by robotic systems jpo .
the packbot scout robot on their stand was partially mangled by an encounter with an improvised explosive device in iraq .
having prevented the bomb blowing up a larger vehicle carrying people , it had done its job .
the military is also operating hundreds if not thousands of small unmanned planes in iraq and afghanistan .
they are often used by small units to patrol and assess the battlefield up to 10km ahead , said captain james lee , of the us marine corps .
the marines are due to switch from the dragon eye aircraft to the new raven b model , which can fly for longer , has better night-time capability and weighs less , within the next six months .
" the good thing about this system is you do n't have to send a marine out and risk that life , " capt lee said .
" you can put this up in the air and it will give you that over-the-hill capability that you are looking for . "
the machines cost over $ 100,000 , he said , but they are designed to be easily fixed up using duct tape and other materials , giving them long lives .
" if you look at the fact they are helping save lives ' in country ' right now , they are beyond priceless , " capt lee said .
fierce weather technologies for small unmanned surveillance planes are developing fast .
lockheed martin has developed one , the stalker , which is silent , ideal for covert night-time operations .
the firm aurora is producing the goldeneye , which uses ducted fans for power , takes off and lands vertically and can fly for eight hours or hover for three .
on a larger scale , mr donnithorne-tait said he believes the current generation of combat aircraft such as the eurofighter could be the last to be flown by humans .
" it 's already pretty clear that in the future if we are going to have combat aircraft , they will be unmanned , just because they will outperform manned aviation because of the limitations of the human frame , " he said .
" and , because there 's no human in there , they can be sent into hazardous places like fierce weather conditions where you could never put a person .
and if the worse comes to the worse and it crashes , it does n't kill the pilot . "
civilian use while many unmanned vehicles are designed for military use , increasingly companies are also looking to tap into civilian commercial markets .
canadian firm micropilot has developed an autopilot that weighs only 28g and fits in a 6lb -lrb- 2.7kg -rrb- radio-controlled model plane .
using the crop cam system , the operator can programme the desired flight path using a laptop , launch the plane by hand and start receiving images in less than 20 minutes from the on-board camera .
costing $ 7,000 , it is already being used by universities to monitor wildlife such as eagles , by farmers to check on crops and by forestry managers to count trees in remote areas .
a design from the us naval research laboratory , called the sail-a-plane , is still in the research phase but seeks to combine an unmanned water and airborne craft in one .
the idea is that it will fly to a location , then land on water and swivel its wings to act as sails if it needs to remain in one place for a longer time than an aircraft could circle or hover .
robot threat ?
meanwhile , unmanned vehicles are transforming exploration of the world 's oceans .
surface water vehicles are ideal for monitoring coasts and harbours , while underwater devices can hunt for mines , pipelines and shipwrecks or map the ocean at great depths .
california-based firm applied signal technology has developed a device which uses a process called synthetic aperture sonar to create detailed pictures of the sea bed using acoustic imaging .
instead of having to store or send back digital images to be analysed , the sonar system can provide data in real time and is not hampered by murky water .
the us department of fisheries is using the technology to search for lobster traps that have come loose from their floats and now endanger marine life on the sea floor .
it could also be used instead of divers to find debris from plane crashes .
with so many new machines on the drawing board or in production , people could for forgiven for fearing that human beings may become redundant .
but , mr donnithorne-tait does not believe this will be the case .
" the general idea is that it 's robotics to assist people , not to replace people . "

the day could soon come when a robot vehicle takes humans ' place as a matter of course .
scientists are focused on developing unmanned machines that can operate in the air , on the ground and under water , doing jobs where deploying people is just too dangerous .
some are already in use , such as the unmanned drones which fly over iraq and afghanistan carrying out reconnaissance for soldiers on the ground , or bomb disposal robots which disable deadly explosive devices .
others , still in the development stage , are taking advantage of smaller , lighter components and advances in computer technology to do things never imagined a decade ago .
some of the latest advances have been on show at the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- conference in washington dc .
on the ground so far the technology for unmanned ground vehicles has been the hardest to develop because of the amount of " clutter " they have to negotiate compared with those in the air or water .
the semi-autonomous vehicle can choose its own route and drive itself but dewar donnithorne-tait , of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- , predicted that by 2050 people will only drive themselves around if they choose to do so , because it will be safer , cheaper and easier to use automated machines .
one pioneering ground vehicle on display , developed by general dynamics robotic systems , will be among the first semi-autonomous vehicles to be produced for the military .
designed for use in sensitive areas such as a large ammunition compound , the mdars machine can use data to choose its own routes , drive itself and even " talk " to the locks on bunkers to check they have not been tampered with .
infrared sensors and cameras allow it to avoid obstacles , detect intruders , inventory equipment and see if anything has moved out of place .
it can share roads with other vehicles , run for 16 hours on one tank of petrol and , unlike a person , will not be bored by routine or become complacent .
one human operator can monitor up to a dozen of the machines at a time .
jay rosenblum , of general dynamics robotic systems , said the first customer would be the us army , which has ordered six to start with .

the packbot scout robot on their stand was partially mangled by an encounter with an improvised explosive device in iraq .
having prevented the bomb blowing up a larger vehicle carrying people , it had done its job .
the military is also operating hundreds if not thousands of small unmanned planes in iraq and afghanistan .
they are often used by small units to patrol and assess the battlefield up to 10km ahead , said captain james lee , of the us marine corps .
the marines are due to switch from the dragon eye aircraft to the new raven b model , which can fly for longer , has better night-time capability and weighs less , within the next six months .

the day could soon come when a robot vehicle takes humans ' place as a matter of course .
scientists are focused on developing unmanned machines that can operate in the air , on the ground and under water , doing jobs where deploying people is just too dangerous .
some are already in use , such as the unmanned drones which fly over iraq and afghanistan carrying out reconnaissance for soldiers on the ground , or bomb disposal robots which disable deadly explosive devices .
others , still in the development stage , are taking advantage of smaller , lighter components and advances in computer technology to do things never imagined a decade ago .
some of the latest advances have been on show at the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- conference in washington dc .
on the ground so far the technology for unmanned ground vehicles has been the hardest to develop because of the amount of " clutter " they have to negotiate compared with those in the air or water .
the semi-autonomous vehicle can choose its own route and drive itself but dewar donnithorne-tait , of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international -lrb- auvsi -rrb- , predicted that by 2050 people will only drive themselves around if they choose to do so , because it will be safer , cheaper and easier to use automated machines .
one pioneering ground vehicle on display , developed by general dynamics robotic systems , will be among the first semi-autonomous vehicles to be produced for the military .
designed for use in sensitive areas such as a large ammunition compound , the mdars machine can use data to choose its own routes , drive itself and even " talk " to the locks on bunkers to check they have not been tampered with .
infrared sensors and cameras allow it to avoid obstacles , detect intruders , inventory equipment and see if anything has moved out of place .
it can share roads with other vehicles , run for 16 hours on one tank of petrol and , unlike a person , will not be bored by routine or become complacent .
one human operator can monitor up to a dozen of the machines at a time .
jay rosenblum , of general dynamics robotic systems , said the first customer would be the us army , which has ordered six to start with .
other organisations would come on board once convinced of the " cost-effectiveness of replacing humans " , he said .
' beyond priceless ' the same semi-autonomous technology may in the future be transferred to a robust vehicle for use in combat situations , replacing current machines which must be remote controlled by human operators .
the good thing about this system is you do n't have to send a marine out and risk that life captain james lee one such device was displayed by robotic systems jpo .
the packbot scout robot on their stand was partially mangled by an encounter with an improvised explosive device in iraq .
having prevented the bomb blowing up a larger vehicle carrying people , it had done its job .
the military is also operating hundreds if not thousands of small unmanned planes in iraq and afghanistan .
they are often used by small units to patrol and assess the battlefield up to 10km ahead , said captain james lee , of the us marine corps .
the marines are due to switch from the dragon eye aircraft to the new raven b model , which can fly for longer , has better night-time capability and weighs less , within the next six months .
a hidden explosive device in iraq damaged this unmanned vehicle " the good thing about this system is you do n't have to send a marine out and risk that life , " capt lee said .
" you can put this up in the air and it will give you that over-the-hill capability that you are looking for . "
the machines cost over $ 100,000 , he said , but they are designed to be easily fixed up using duct tape and other materials , giving them long lives .
" if you look at the fact they are helping save lives ' in country ' right now , they are beyond priceless , " capt lee said .
fierce weather technologies for small unmanned surveillance planes are developing fast .
lockheed martin has developed one , the stalker , which is silent , ideal for covert night-time operations .
the goldeneye takes off and lands vertically and can hover for hours the firm aurora is producing the goldeneye , which uses ducted fans for power , takes off and lands vertically and can fly for eight hours or hover for three .
on a larger scale , mr donnithorne-tait said he believes the current generation of combat aircraft such as the eurofighter could be the last to be flown by humans .
" it 's already pretty clear that in the future if we are going to have combat aircraft , they will be unmanned , just because they will outperform manned aviation because of the limitations of the human frame , " he said .
" and , because there 's no human in there , they can be sent into hazardous places like fierce weather conditions where you could never put a person .
and if the worse comes to the worse and it crashes , it does n't kill the pilot . "
civilian use while many unmanned vehicles are designed for military use , increasingly companies are also looking to tap into civilian commercial markets .
new sonar technology can be used to create images of the sea bed canadian firm micropilot has developed an autopilot that weighs only 28g and fits in a 6lb -lrb- 2.7kg -rrb- radio-controlled model plane .
using the crop cam system , the operator can programme the desired flight path using a laptop , launch the plane by hand and start receiving images in less than 20 minutes from the on-board camera .

will robots one day make human beings redundant ?
surface water vehicles are ideal for monitoring coasts and harbours , while underwater devices can hunt for mines , pipelines and shipwrecks or map the ocean at great depths .
california-based firm applied signal technology has developed a device which uses a process called synthetic aperture sonar to create detailed pictures of the sea bed using acoustic imaging .

the government issued the denial after former chief inspector of schools mike tomlinson claimed there was a new " willingness " to revisit the issue .
he proposed in 2004 that a new system of diplomas should replace existing qualifications including the a-level .
but the government opted to bring in diplomas alongside a-levels .
the prime minister is very concerned about skill levels and very keen to find ways of enhancing them sir mike tomlinson the first pupils will begin the new diplomas next year in five subject areas , including construction and engineering .
they are intended as a mixture of theoretical and practical learning .
but they are in danger of tending to be seen as primarily vocational , so there has been concern that they will be seen as sink courses for non-academic pupils and take second place to a-levels .
sir mike told bbc radio 4 's world at one he believed gordon brown 's government was willing to look at the issue again .
" the prime minister is very concerned about skill levels and very keen to find ways of enhancing them .
" i 'm sure that if he thought there were other changes which could be made to enhance that part of the policy , then i 'm sure he would give it serious consideration . "
academic divide he said there was always due to be a review in 2008 and it was a question of whether mr brown would look at these parts of his proposals more sympathetically .
can we detect a sniff of another potential brown u-turn ?
bbc political correspondent laura kuenssberg read laura 's thoughts in full his comments were backed up by former education secretary estelle morris who said she hoped mr brown would look at a more integrated qualification .
however , schools minister kevin brennan said although the government was determined to end the divide between academic and vocational education , there were " no plans to scrap a-levels " .
" we recently announced revisions to the a-level system to ensure that the highest levels of achievement are recognised .
" it is a testament to our education reforms and the hard work of pupils and teachers that more young people than ever now have the opportunity to do a-levels and to do well in them . "
