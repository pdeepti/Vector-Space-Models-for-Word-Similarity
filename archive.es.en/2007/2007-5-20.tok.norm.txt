it took until week two of the bundesliga to pick up their first win when they poached a 3-2 win at arminia bielefeld as brazilian striker cacau netted two second-half goals .
but a 3-1 home defeat by borussia dortmund followed at the end of august and left stuttgart hovering just above the relegation zone .
however , an impressive 3-2 win at werder bremen on september 16 turned their fortunes around .
having gone 2-0 down , stuttgart fought back with 21-year-old striker mario gomez hitting the winning goal three minutes from time .
draws against eintracht frankfurt and hertha berlin were followed by a 3-0 hammering of bayer leverkusen on october 14 which lifted them up the table to eighth .
unexpected title-contenders but stuttgart only really got in amongst the title-contenders when they made german soccer sit up and take notice with a 3-0 win over schalke 04 at the end of october as sami khedira hit goals either side of half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart attracted attention in october with a 3-0 win over schalke another goal bonanza followed the following week against alemannia aachen with a 4-2 win which took the side to second in the table as marco streller hit two late goals .
comfortable victories over hamburg and hanover followed which put them in top-spot at the end of november , only for bayern munich to burst the bubble when they beat stuttgart 2-1 at the allianz arena on november 18 .
the defeat dropped stuttgart to third and allowed schalke and werder bremen to leap-frog them .
they dropped further down the table to fourth at the christmas break .
in january , a 3-2 win over bielefeld at the end of january put them third and stuttgart stayed in touch with schalke and bremen through out february .
a 1-0 win over dortmund gave them some revenge for their opening day defeat and they closed the gap between themselves and bremen in second with a 4-1 win at home to werder on february 10 .
trying times they moved into second with a 4-0 win at eintracht frankfurt on february 16 , but march began badly as armin veh 's men slipped back to third again when they were 2-0 down at half-time at bayer leverkusen and lost 3-1 .
although they still managed to pick up a point , stuttgart lost influential 21-year-old striker mario gomez on march 10 when he picked up a knee injury which kept him out for the next two months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's injury was a blow a 1-0 defeat at schalke on march 17 left stuttgart in third , but seven points off the victors who stayed top and with eight games left , their title challenge looked to be fading .
but a 3-1 win at aachen , on the same day schalke were well-beaten 2-0 at bayern munich , narrowed the gap to just four points .
then at the start of april , a 4-2 win over hamburg kept them in touch as schalke and second-placed bremen both won .
cacau saved the day three-points came in the win over hamburg , but cacau was to prove the star of the day on april 21 when he netted twice in as many minutes to give stuttart a 2-0 win over bayern munich which all but guaranteed them a champions league place .
and the door to the top of the table was flung open in style on week 31 when schalke lost 2-1 at bochum on the friday , stuttgart beat relegated borussia moechengladbach on the saturday while bremen were shocked 3-2 at bielefeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all wrapped up on saturday the results put stuttgart second and just a point behind leaders schalke .
then on may 12 , their 3-2 win at bochum , as schalke were well-beaten 2-0 at dortmund and bremen were beaten by eintracht frankfurt , put stuttgart back on top again by two points with a game left to go .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to bow to demands to move troops into the south . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : afghan bombing aimed to prevent reconstruction german chancellor angela merkel condemned a suicide-bombing attack on saturday in northern afghanistan that killed nine people , three of them german soldiers on duty .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .

her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .

one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .
after investing in a new stall for bulls in the 1980s and earning 8 deutsche marks -lrb- 4.09 euros -rrb- per kilo for their beef , the bse crisis left them only earning half that .
a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .
he is clearly not alone .
" the people here are concerned with traditional values , " said freimut mayor hannelore reinbold-mesch .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .
after investing in a new stall for bulls in the 1980s and earning 8 deutsche marks -lrb- 4.09 euros -rrb- per kilo for their beef , the bse crisis left them only earning half that .
a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .
he is clearly not alone .
" the people here are concerned with traditional values , " said freimut mayor hannelore reinbold-mesch .
" they 're connected to nature ; they have always lived with nature , harvested its fruits .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .
after investing in a new stall for bulls in the 1980s and earning 8 deutsche marks -lrb- 4.09 euros -rrb- per kilo for their beef , the bse crisis left them only earning half that .
a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .
he is clearly not alone .
" the people here are concerned with traditional values , " said freimut mayor hannelore reinbold-mesch .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .

by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .

setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .

"
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "
the europeans will have therefore to accept bush 's choice as they did two years ago with wolfowitz . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.05.2007 campaigners march for gay rights in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands turned out for the march gay rights campaigners from poland and across europe marched in warsaw saturday in an annual rally galvanized by what activists say is rampant public and official homophobia in this overwhelmingly catholic country . around 4,000 people turned out for the equality parade , police said . many of the participants carried the rainbow flag , the symbol of homosexual rights , and marched under the slogan " love thy neighbor " - the use of the biblical commandant an apparent swipe at ultra-catholic protesters . there was little sign of the flamboyant dress , including drag , which is a feature of gay pride events in other european union countries where the lot of homosexuals is seen as better than in poland . the warsaw march , which drew only a few score demonstrators when it began in 2001 , has a traditionally political edge due to official bans and sometimes violent counter-demonstrations .
only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .

he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "
the europeans will have therefore to accept bush 's choice as they did two years ago with wolfowitz . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .
after investing in a new stall for bulls in the 1980s and earning 8 deutsche marks -lrb- 4.09 euros -rrb- per kilo for their beef , the bse crisis left them only earning half that .
a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .
he is clearly not alone .
" the people here are concerned with traditional values , " said freimut mayor hannelore reinbold-mesch .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .

three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "

it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .

one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .
after investing in a new stall for bulls in the 1980s and earning 8 deutsche marks -lrb- 4.09 euros -rrb- per kilo for their beef , the bse crisis left them only earning half that .
a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .
he is clearly not alone .
" the people here are concerned with traditional values , " said freimut mayor hannelore reinbold-mesch .
" they 're connected to nature ; they have always lived with nature , harvested its fruits .
and that 's where a change simply occurred .
what used to be cultivating the land is today renewable energies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 20.05.2007 berlin 's old jewish quarter transformed into art gallery haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has become a center of artisitic activity the center of berlin 's old pre-war jewish quarter has been taken over by contemporary art galleries and a colony of artists working in spacious , high-ceilinged studios . increasing numbers of art buyers and foreign tourists from asia , the united states and europe are pouring into the capital 's " gallery mile " along the fashionable auguststrasse .
the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .
" the work evolves because the artists evolve .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .

it took until week two of the bundesliga to pick up their first win when they poached a 3-2 win at arminia bielefeld as brazilian striker cacau netted two second-half goals .
but a 3-1 home defeat by borussia dortmund followed at the end of august and left stuttgart hovering just above the relegation zone .
however , an impressive 3-2 win at werder bremen on september 16 turned their fortunes around .
having gone 2-0 down , stuttgart fought back with 21-year-old striker mario gomez hitting the winning goal three minutes from time .
draws against eintracht frankfurt and hertha berlin were followed by a 3-0 hammering of bayer leverkusen on october 14 which lifted them up the table to eighth .
unexpected title-contenders but stuttgart only really got in amongst the title-contenders when they made german soccer sit up and take notice with a 3-0 win over schalke 04 at the end of october as sami khedira hit goals either side of half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart attracted attention in october with a 3-0 win over schalke another goal bonanza followed the following week against alemannia aachen with a 4-2 win which took the side to second in the table as marco streller hit two late goals .
comfortable victories over hamburg and hanover followed which put them in top-spot at the end of november , only for bayern munich to burst the bubble when they beat stuttgart 2-1 at the allianz arena on november 18 .
the defeat dropped stuttgart to third and allowed schalke and werder bremen to leap-frog them .
they dropped further down the table to fourth at the christmas break .
in january , a 3-2 win over bielefeld at the end of january put them third and stuttgart stayed in touch with schalke and bremen through out february .
a 1-0 win over dortmund gave them some revenge for their opening day defeat and they closed the gap between themselves and bremen in second with a 4-1 win at home to werder on february 10 .
trying times they moved into second with a 4-0 win at eintracht frankfurt on february 16 , but march began badly as armin veh 's men slipped back to third again when they were 2-0 down at half-time at bayer leverkusen and lost 3-1 .
although they still managed to pick up a point , stuttgart lost influential 21-year-old striker mario gomez on march 10 when he picked up a knee injury which kept him out for the next two months .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 20.05.2007 german forces will stay in afghanistan , top politicians say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no 100 percent protection against suicide attacks , said germany 's defense minister the german military will not turn its back on afghanistan despite suffering its worst casualties for four years in a suicide bombing , politicians from the governing coalition said on sunday . three german soldiers and six afghans were killed on saturday when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded market in the northern city of kunduz on saturday .
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to bow to demands to move troops into the south . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : afghan bombing aimed to prevent reconstruction german chancellor angela merkel condemned a suicide-bombing attack on saturday in northern afghanistan that killed nine people , three of them german soldiers on duty .
-lrb- 19.05.2007 -rrb- berlin bars deployment of german army to violent afghan south german defense minister jung has turned down a request from kabul to send soldiers to the turbulent south of the country amid concerns the deployment would amount to a direct participation in combat operations .
-lrb- 04.05.2007 -rrb- german tornado jets start mission in afghanistan german reconnaissance tornado jets began a controversial mission in afghanistan sunday , flying their first mission in support of nato-led forces fighting the taliban in the south of the country .

it took until week two of the bundesliga to pick up their first win when they poached a 3-2 win at arminia bielefeld as brazilian striker cacau netted two second-half goals .
but a 3-1 home defeat by borussia dortmund followed at the end of august and left stuttgart hovering just above the relegation zone .
however , an impressive 3-2 win at werder bremen on september 16 turned their fortunes around .
having gone 2-0 down , stuttgart fought back with 21-year-old striker mario gomez hitting the winning goal three minutes from time .
draws against eintracht frankfurt and hertha berlin were followed by a 3-0 hammering of bayer leverkusen on october 14 which lifted them up the table to eighth .
unexpected title-contenders but stuttgart only really got in amongst the title-contenders when they made german soccer sit up and take notice with a 3-0 win over schalke 04 at the end of october as sami khedira hit goals either side of half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart attracted attention in october with a 3-0 win over schalke another goal bonanza followed the following week against alemannia aachen with a 4-2 win which took the side to second in the table as marco streller hit two late goals .
comfortable victories over hamburg and hanover followed which put them in top-spot at the end of november , only for bayern munich to burst the bubble when they beat stuttgart 2-1 at the allianz arena on november 18 .
the defeat dropped stuttgart to third and allowed schalke and werder bremen to leap-frog them .
they dropped further down the table to fourth at the christmas break .
in january , a 3-2 win over bielefeld at the end of january put them third and stuttgart stayed in touch with schalke and bremen through out february .
a 1-0 win over dortmund gave them some revenge for their opening day defeat and they closed the gap between themselves and bremen in second with a 4-1 win at home to werder on february 10 .
trying times they moved into second with a 4-0 win at eintracht frankfurt on february 16 , but march began badly as armin veh 's men slipped back to third again when they were 2-0 down at half-time at bayer leverkusen and lost 3-1 .
although they still managed to pick up a point , stuttgart lost influential 21-year-old striker mario gomez on march 10 when he picked up a knee injury which kept him out for the next two months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's injury was a blow a 1-0 defeat at schalke on march 17 left stuttgart in third , but seven points off the victors who stayed top and with eight games left , their title challenge looked to be fading .
but a 3-1 win at aachen , on the same day schalke were well-beaten 2-0 at bayern munich , narrowed the gap to just four points .
then at the start of april , a 4-2 win over hamburg kept them in touch as schalke and second-placed bremen both won .
cacau saved the day three-points came in the win over hamburg , but cacau was to prove the star of the day on april 21 when he netted twice in as many minutes to give stuttart a 2-0 win over bayern munich which all but guaranteed them a champions league place .
and the door to the top of the table was flung open in style on week 31 when schalke lost 2-1 at bochum on the friday , stuttgart beat relegated borussia moechengladbach on the saturday while bremen were shocked 3-2 at bielefeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all wrapped up on saturday the results put stuttgart second and just a point behind leaders schalke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.05.2007 campaigners march for gay rights in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands turned out for the march gay rights campaigners from poland and across europe marched in warsaw saturday in an annual rally galvanized by what activists say is rampant public and official homophobia in this overwhelmingly catholic country . around 4,000 people turned out for the equality parade , police said . many of the participants carried the rainbow flag , the symbol of homosexual rights , and marched under the slogan " love thy neighbor " - the use of the biblical commandant an apparent swipe at ultra-catholic protesters . there was little sign of the flamboyant dress , including drag , which is a feature of gay pride events in other european union countries where the lot of homosexuals is seen as better than in poland . the warsaw march , which drew only a few score demonstrators when it began in 2001 , has a traditionally political edge due to official bans and sometimes violent counter-demonstrations .
only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.05.2007 campaigners march for gay rights in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands turned out for the march gay rights campaigners from poland and across europe marched in warsaw saturday in an annual rally galvanized by what activists say is rampant public and official homophobia in this overwhelmingly catholic country . around 4,000 people turned out for the equality parade , police said . many of the participants carried the rainbow flag , the symbol of homosexual rights , and marched under the slogan " love thy neighbor " - the use of the biblical commandant an apparent swipe at ultra-catholic protesters . there was little sign of the flamboyant dress , including drag , which is a feature of gay pride events in other european union countries where the lot of homosexuals is seen as better than in poland . the warsaw march , which drew only a few score demonstrators when it began in 2001 , has a traditionally political edge due to official bans and sometimes violent counter-demonstrations .
only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .

setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .

"
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .

setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 20.05.2007 berlin 's old jewish quarter transformed into art gallery haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has become a center of artisitic activity the center of berlin 's old pre-war jewish quarter has been taken over by contemporary art galleries and a colony of artists working in spacious , high-ceilinged studios . increasing numbers of art buyers and foreign tourists from asia , the united states and europe are pouring into the capital 's " gallery mile " along the fashionable auguststrasse .
the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .

it took until week two of the bundesliga to pick up their first win when they poached a 3-2 win at arminia bielefeld as brazilian striker cacau netted two second-half goals .
but a 3-1 home defeat by borussia dortmund followed at the end of august and left stuttgart hovering just above the relegation zone .
however , an impressive 3-2 win at werder bremen on september 16 turned their fortunes around .
having gone 2-0 down , stuttgart fought back with 21-year-old striker mario gomez hitting the winning goal three minutes from time .
draws against eintracht frankfurt and hertha berlin were followed by a 3-0 hammering of bayer leverkusen on october 14 which lifted them up the table to eighth .
unexpected title-contenders but stuttgart only really got in amongst the title-contenders when they made german soccer sit up and take notice with a 3-0 win over schalke 04 at the end of october as sami khedira hit goals either side of half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart attracted attention in october with a 3-0 win over schalke another goal bonanza followed the following week against alemannia aachen with a 4-2 win which took the side to second in the table as marco streller hit two late goals .
comfortable victories over hamburg and hanover followed which put them in top-spot at the end of november , only for bayern munich to burst the bubble when they beat stuttgart 2-1 at the allianz arena on november 18 .
the defeat dropped stuttgart to third and allowed schalke and werder bremen to leap-frog them .
they dropped further down the table to fourth at the christmas break .
in january , a 3-2 win over bielefeld at the end of january put them third and stuttgart stayed in touch with schalke and bremen through out february .
a 1-0 win over dortmund gave them some revenge for their opening day defeat and they closed the gap between themselves and bremen in second with a 4-1 win at home to werder on february 10 .
trying times they moved into second with a 4-0 win at eintracht frankfurt on february 16 , but march began badly as armin veh 's men slipped back to third again when they were 2-0 down at half-time at bayer leverkusen and lost 3-1 .
although they still managed to pick up a point , stuttgart lost influential 21-year-old striker mario gomez on march 10 when he picked up a knee injury which kept him out for the next two months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's injury was a blow a 1-0 defeat at schalke on march 17 left stuttgart in third , but seven points off the victors who stayed top and with eight games left , their title challenge looked to be fading .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 20.05.2007 berlin 's old jewish quarter transformed into art gallery haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has become a center of artisitic activity the center of berlin 's old pre-war jewish quarter has been taken over by contemporary art galleries and a colony of artists working in spacious , high-ceilinged studios . increasing numbers of art buyers and foreign tourists from asia , the united states and europe are pouring into the capital 's " gallery mile " along the fashionable auguststrasse .
the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to bow to demands to move troops into the south . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : afghan bombing aimed to prevent reconstruction german chancellor angela merkel condemned a suicide-bombing attack on saturday in northern afghanistan that killed nine people , three of them german soldiers on duty .

karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "

" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "
the europeans will have therefore to accept bush 's choice as they did two years ago with wolfowitz . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "
the europeans will have therefore to accept bush 's choice as they did two years ago with wolfowitz . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .
holding 16.38 percent of the bank 's shares , the united states is its principal stakeholder , followed by japan -lrb- 7.86 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 4.49 percent -rrb- , france and britain -lrb- 4.3 percent each -rrb- .
setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "
the europeans will have therefore to accept bush 's choice as they did two years ago with wolfowitz . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .

" but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to bow to demands to move troops into the south . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : afghan bombing aimed to prevent reconstruction german chancellor angela merkel condemned a suicide-bombing attack on saturday in northern afghanistan that killed nine people , three of them german soldiers on duty .
-lrb- 19.05.2007 -rrb- berlin bars deployment of german army to violent afghan south german defense minister jung has turned down a request from kabul to send soldiers to the turbulent south of the country amid concerns the deployment would amount to a direct participation in combat operations .
-lrb- 04.05.2007 -rrb- german tornado jets start mission in afghanistan german reconnaissance tornado jets began a controversial mission in afghanistan sunday , flying their first mission in support of nato-led forces fighting the taliban in the south of the country .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .
but it was n't the determining factor , " he said .
by tradition , the president of the world bank is chosen by americans while the head of the international monetary funds -lrb- imf -rrb- , the sister institution , is selected by europeans .
qualifications should take precedence a number of voices , including those coming from non-governmental organizations and some governments , rose in favor of abandoning that unwritten rule .
dutch development and cooperation minister bert koenders pointed out friday that qualifications criteria should prevail in the selection of a future bank president over nationality .
but that approach would probably mean that americans would ask europeans to renounce their claim to leadership at the imf , a request the latter would most likely find " unpalatable , " insisted devesh kapur , author of a history of the imf .

setback for bush japan kept away from the fray sparked by the wolfowitz controversy , but the germans , french and british have made it clear that they favored his departure .
his decision to resign has helped avoid a vote by the bank 's 24-member board of directors that could have resulted in his dismissal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will get to chose the world bank 's chief again such a vote would have put the united states in a minority as a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in the middle of the crisis : " an abstention is out of the question . "
as a result , bush 's republican administration has suffered a setback and now will have to choose wolfowitz 's successor .
white house spokesman tony fratto said friday that the bush administration wanted " to move swiftly in this process . "
asked if bush might nominate someone who was not a us national , fratto said : " potentially , sure . "
the spokesman also recalled : " traditionally the american nominee has become the world bank president . "

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .

prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

" to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .

it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity .

he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to bow to demands to move troops into the south . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : afghan bombing aimed to prevent reconstruction german chancellor angela merkel condemned a suicide-bombing attack on saturday in northern afghanistan that killed nine people , three of them german soldiers on duty .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .
wolfowitz announced thursday he would resign on june 30 after a bank panel found he had violated the organization 's code of conduct by arranging a hefty pay and promotion deal for his girlfriend , a fellow bank employee .
" i think a lot of agendas converged in taking down paul wolfowitz , " argued steve clemons , an expert with the new america foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe resented wolfowitz " i think there was residual resentment of wolfowitz 's treatment of europeans and the whole kind of international process that lay just beneath the surface of much of this .

even at that time , european countries opposed to the war felt bad about the choice made by bush , but resigned themselves and went along with it .
" wolfowitz 's departure may have been justified , but his leaving had more to do with the bureaucracy 's resentment of his role in the iraq war and his internal reform initiatives than about his lapse of ethics , " said ian vasquez , director of the center for global liberty and prosperity at cato institute , a washington think tank .
wolfowitz himself felt he was a victim of an urge for revenge that fired up some of his opponents .
as early as april 12 , when the crisis sparked by charges of favoritism first erupted , he declared to his critics that he did not work for the us government any more and represented only the bank and its 185 members .

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which was the worst on the 3,000 german troops serving in afghanistan since four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul in 2003 .
members of both sides of the right-left coalition in power in berlin said germany 's commitment to rebuilding afghanistan would not be shaken by the attack .
karl theodor guttenberg , a foreign policy specialist from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , said : " it would be absurd to withdraw and it would only worsen the terrorist threat .
it would also increase the demands from terrorists towards the international community and us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack took place on this site , at a market in kunduz a radical islamic group currently holding two german civilians hostage in iraq has threatened to execute them unless germany pulls its troops out of afghanistan , where it is the third-largest force after the united states and britain .
" justified to prolong mandate " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , who form the other half of the coalition , told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . "
merkel described the attacks as " treacherous murders , " while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the bombing and said " the enemies of afghanistan must understand that they will never be able to hamper the progress of afghanistan with their acts of cowardice . "
defense minister franz josef jung said the soldiers had got out of their armored vehicle and were shopping in the bazaar when the bomber struck .
winning hearts and minds " we must win the confidence of the local population , " he told bild am sonntag .
" to do that it is necessary to get out of the armored cars .
unfortunately there is no 100 percent protection against suicide bombers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung the attack on saturday brought to 21 the number of german soldiers who have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the isaf international mission to afghanistan have died this year , mostly in attacks or combat missions .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

it took until week two of the bundesliga to pick up their first win when they poached a 3-2 win at arminia bielefeld as brazilian striker cacau netted two second-half goals .
but a 3-1 home defeat by borussia dortmund followed at the end of august and left stuttgart hovering just above the relegation zone .
however , an impressive 3-2 win at werder bremen on september 16 turned their fortunes around .
having gone 2-0 down , stuttgart fought back with 21-year-old striker mario gomez hitting the winning goal three minutes from time .
draws against eintracht frankfurt and hertha berlin were followed by a 3-0 hammering of bayer leverkusen on october 14 which lifted them up the table to eighth .
unexpected title-contenders but stuttgart only really got in amongst the title-contenders when they made german soccer sit up and take notice with a 3-0 win over schalke 04 at the end of october as sami khedira hit goals either side of half-time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.05.2007 campaigners march for gay rights in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands turned out for the march gay rights campaigners from poland and across europe marched in warsaw saturday in an annual rally galvanized by what activists say is rampant public and official homophobia in this overwhelmingly catholic country . around 4,000 people turned out for the equality parade , police said . many of the participants carried the rainbow flag , the symbol of homosexual rights , and marched under the slogan " love thy neighbor " - the use of the biblical commandant an apparent swipe at ultra-catholic protesters . there was little sign of the flamboyant dress , including drag , which is a feature of gay pride events in other european union countries where the lot of homosexuals is seen as better than in poland . the warsaw march , which drew only a few score demonstrators when it began in 2001 , has a traditionally political edge due to official bans and sometimes violent counter-demonstrations .
only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .
if the civil rights of any minority are in danger , any european democrat has to speak out , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : poland considers outlawing homosexual material in schools poland is debating a bill that would make all material dealing with homosexuality , including educational information , illegal as way of protecting school children from " homosexual propaganda . " -lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- dw-world : eu , public shrug as poland keeps trying to curb journalists poland 's intellectuals are feeling the heat as the government vows to push through a controversial new law designed to purge communists from public life .
but so far , criticism has been faint .

the street in the mitte district of what used to be east berlin is typical of the transformation that the capital has been undergoing since the fall of the berlin wall 18 years ago .
wedged between a cluster of galleries is clarechen 's ballhaus , an old dance-hall originally commissioned by kaiser wilhelm 's butler in 1913 .
today , it still draws young and old alike , eager to swing a leg and dance cheek-to-cheek .
on the lower part of a huge , soulful-looking , red-brick building random religious messages plead for people to love one another .
" jesus loves you " reads a slogan .
a green square squeezed between gallery buildings offers a refuge and space for people to rest weary feet , as well as catch a glimpse of the nearby television tower that soars above the rooftops .
a colorful mix " a lot has changed , " said peter dittmar , an art historian who operates galerie dittmar .
" auguststrasse has become a center of art gallery interest and i wanted to become part of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's most impressive synagogue is just around the corner " i show a mix of artists , " he said .
" this year , it 's been mostly the work of photographic artists , some of it black and white .
last year , it was italian artists . "
occasionally , elderly jewish visitors from the us who were born in berlin before the nazis seized power , drop in at his gallery , curious to learn about the revival of cultural life in the area .
nearby , on oranienburgerstrasse , the restored synagogue dome gleams in the sunshine .
unlike hundreds of synagogues and other buildings owned or used by jews that nazis mobs attacked and set ablaze during kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- in november 1938 , it mercifully escaped serious damage .
three years ago , tanja gerken opened the galerie gerken on the east end of auguststrasse , after she had spent seven years working and studying in paris and london .
at galeria gerken , renata toumarova , a st.petersburg-born artist studying at berlin 's university of the arts is exhibiting her latest work , entitled " on the way . "
" renata is a natural talent , who has wonderful movement in her work , " said tanja gerken .
" it 's her second show at my gallery , and she 's only 20 .
her style is bold , very much her own , and indicates her talent , independence and power of expression . "
berlin scene asked about the berlin art scene , tanja gerken said : " i think many people underestimate the strength of berlin .
it 's a city that responds to artists and to new ideas .
in 10 years ' time it will be the art city in germany . "
at deschler gallery further down auguststrasse , american artist jay mark johnson 's " tai chi motion studies " were admired by visitors .
with a modified camera , johnson took action shots illustrating the progressive patterns and movements of actors , dancers and martial arts performers .
the deschler gallery is the brainchild of markus deschler , from ulm in southern germany .
" he opened the gallery in 1995 when berlin was in flux after reunification and many artists were arriving to rent studios , " said simone weicher , who runs the gallery in deschler 's absence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fetting 's sculpture of brandt got bono 's attention " we specialize in new trends in art , with some of our artists also being sculptors , like rainer fetting , who is famous internationally , " she said .
one of fetting 's works , a sculpture of the late chancellor willy brandt , now stands on permanent display at the headquarters of his social democratic party in berlin .
" there are 400 art galleries in berlin , " noted frau weicher .
" they attract the attention of buyers and collectors from home and abroad , and of course we profit from that . "
celebrity art dealer few contemporary art dealers these days receive as much attention as their artists .
one who does in berlin is 47-year-old gerd harry lybke , who runs two art galleries - one in the capital and the other in leipzig where he sparked an explosion of young german painting in the late 1980s and ' 90s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke 's leipzig eigen + art gallery lybke has come a long way since the days when he posed as a model at the leipzig academy in the early 1980s after spurning a seven-year stint studying atomic science in russia .
now a wealthy man , he relishes his art-world power .
his stable of artists includes painters david schnell , tim eitel and mathias weischer , as well as dresden-trained martin eder and neo rauch , whose romantically-tinged paintings of people in heroic , social-realist poses are internationally prized and fetch up to $ 240,000 -lrb- 175,000 euros -rrb- apiece .
new york 's museum of modern art , the guggenheim and noted german collector friedrich christian flick have all acquired works by rauch in recent years .
in miami , the wealthy rubell family owns three schnells , four weischers and five of tim eitel 's works of desolate landscapes and galleries populated with alienated figures .
lybke likes artists whose careers he can nurture from early on , even providing some with studio space .
in return he expects total loyalty , with no other dealers involved unless he has absolute control .
on both sides of the atlantic , lybke is highly successful , with works by his team of artists snapped up at art fair booths in new york , miami , basel , tokyo and london .
few people spoke of an avenue of galleries in berlin mitte in the early 1990s .
but lybke , an expansive , energetic dealer was confident an offshoot on auguststrasse would pay off .
and it did .
" for me berlin is the only place for young art , " he said .

they found it , too , and now supply themselves and their region with environmentally friendly power . walter schneider 's cows graze in green pastures in freiamt , a town of around 4,500 people near the black forest .
due to the low price of milk , however , the farmer ca n't live off them .
it 's a problem schneider shared with many german farmers .
but he found an answer - just as over 100 of his fellow freiamt farmers did .
" as a farmer , you are constantly searching for economic alternatives , " schneider said .
" and regenerative energies like sun , water and wind are simply on offer . "
a few years ago , schneider started to invest in wind energy .
since then four windmills have been installed on the hill overlooking schneider 's farm .
when the wind blows at the speed of three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- per second the rotors start turning .
the windmills reach their peak at eight to 10 meters per second and generate 1,800 kilowatts per hour .
when there 's a good breeze , one of freiamt 's windmills generates enough power within two hours to cover the electricity needs of the average four-person household for an entire year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiamt 's farmers took advantage of laws that promote renewable energy but that 's not schneider 's only environmentally friendly project .
the extra warmth exuded by his cows ' milk , which is cooled from 38 to four degrees celsius -lrb- 100 to 39 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , is used to heat the water his farm uses .
and one of the 100 solar power installations that characterize the town is located on his roof .
nowadays the community produces far more power than it actually needs .
visitors from germany and abroad make their way to freiamt to see for themselves how the town has embraced alternative energies .
biofuel better than bulls the reinbolds also moved away from conventional farming and converted their farm into a renewable energy power plant .
the family uses generators to burn liquid dung and organic raw materials such as rapeseed , corn and grass , and they sell the energy they produce .
the fact that german utilities are obliged by law to buy power from renewable sources at fixed prices gives the farmers security that selling crops or livestock ca n't .
the reinbolds spent 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 809,000 -rrb- on their biofuel plant , and they expect the investment to have paid itself off in 15 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reinbolds " without the fixed electricity price , the 10 cents for electricity from renewable energies , we could n't have done it , " said inge reinbold , adding that the family had already been burned once .

a different approach to nature now , five years after shifting their operations , the reinbolds ' plant generates more than one million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
they calculated that the energy the farm produced in one year with the biofuel plant had would have required 300,000 liters -lrb- 79,000 gallons -rrb- of heating oil .
the reinbolds ' son , harald , who will one day take over the farm , said he was pleased his family managed to make itself independent of fluctuating food prices and that it also reflected his own attitude toward the environment .

only several dozen such protesters were present saturday , most of them members of a far-right youth group . " five members of the group were arrested , " warsaw police spokesman mariusz sokolowski told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a heavy police presence kept the march 's participants and anti-gay protesters apart poland 's homosexual community has in the past complained of living in a " climate of fear . "
prominent homophobes even high-ranking polish politicians make openly homophobic statements . " homophobia is not the exclusive monopoly of poland .
it exists everywhere , " said sophia i n't veld , a dutch member of the european parliament who was attending the march in a show of solidarity . " but the difference is that here there are prominent government politicians who are creating a climate of hatred and fear against homosexuals , " she said , singling out roman giertych , of the far-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- . giertych , who is education minister and a deputy premier in the country 's coalition government , launched a drive this week to ban classroom discussion of homosexuality .
he said the move was vital to protect marriage and the family . his draft law would require school head teachers to stop " homosexual propaganda " in the same way as they have a duty to tackle classroom violence , hatred and discrimination , or pornography . the plans have come under fire from the eu 's equal opportunities commissioner , who has said poland would be in breach of european law if it goes ahead . the council of europe also criticized giertych last year over the sacking of education official miroslaw sielatycki allegedly because he had overseen publication of a polish-language version of a council of europe manual on human rights education , which contained a section on homosexuality and homophobia .
activists from abroad join in besides i n't veld , around two dozen politicians from other eu countries joined the warsaw march , organizers said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was less flamboyant than gay rights events normally are among them were sweden 's european affairs minister cecilia malmstroem , german green party chief claudia roth , and her party colleague volker beck , who is a leading gay activist . " to be here today with so many people , and so much strong support from all over europe , makes clear that progress is possible and that you should not give up , " roth told reporters . earlier this month , an opinion poll found that 53 percent of poles considered homosexuality a sin and 58 percent that gay and lesbians should be denied the right to demonstrate . the 2004 and 2005 marches were banned by warsaw 's then mayor , lech kaczynski , a conservative catholic who was sworn in as president of poland in december 2005 . in 2005 , kaczynski said that spreading " homosexual propaganda " fell outside rules protecting freedom of assembly . several thousand people nonetheless went ahead and marched in 2005 , and earlier this month poland was condemned by the european court of human rights over that year 's ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is well-known for his activism for gay rights the authorities allowed the 2006 march to go ahead , despite repeated calls for a ban from the lpr - which last year joined poland 's coalition government , along with kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
mayor cooperative pis lost control of warsaw city hall in municipal elections last november to a liberal , hanna gronkiewicz-waltz , who organizers said had been " very cooperative . " beck said his attention was already turning further east to russia , where a string of gay pride events have been banned . " we should see it as a global struggle .

according to the british crime survey there are 42,000 regular anabolic steroid users in the uk .
drugs expert jim mcveigh said there could be as many as 100,000 .
" basically we 're looking at numbers being on a par with heroin users , " he added .
one treatment centre in merseyside reports that steroid use has rocketed in the last three years .
staff now treat four new steroid users for every new heroin user - a reversal of the situation in 2004 .
there is a particular problem with users aged under 25 .
nurse deborah jones , who works at the harm reduction centre in wirral , says steroid use has increased particularly among the under 25s .
mr mcveigh , of liverpool john moores university , insists the problem is hidden because people do not admit to using steroids .
" at any one time in liverpool there are approximately 1,000 anabolic steroid users - nationally we 're looking at over 100,000 , " he told bbc radio five live .
younger users every month , the wirral centre sees about 21 users aged under 25 , and the youngest patient is just 16 .
ms jones says the use among younger people is growing as more and more strive for the " perfect body " .
in their perceptions , they have very healthy lifestyles deborah jones , drugs nurse " it 's all about being big , muscular , toned , and they can gain that much quicker using steroids than they ever can working out , " she says .
" it does take over .
they want to have the rippling six pack with the golden body , but most of them end up as the arnold schwarzenegger - that 's what they see as success . "
she likens steroid users to anorexia sufferers in that , regardless of their true size , they still see themselves as " tiny , scrawny , weedy " .
ms jones also says steroids are much easier to obtain now via the internet and mainstream gyms .
" parents will pay for gym subscriptions because they do n't want them on the streets .
they see it as the healthier option , but it can expose them to the steroid culture . "
and the gyms themselves , she claims , will not accept there is a problem . " if you tackled any of the management they would tell you categorically it does n't go on in their place . "
serious risks steroid users are at risk from a range of health complications , including liver damage , high cholesterol and stroke , as well as life-threatening infections like hiv and hepatitis .
younger users may also suffer from acne , extreme mood swings , depression and a lack of sex drive .
another unwanted side effect is gynecomastia - abnormal growth of male breast tissue - because of hormonal changes .
ms jones says many do not accept the risks : " in their perceptions , they have very healthy lifestyles .
basically were looking at numbers being on a par with heroin users jim mcveigh liverpool john moores university " they exercise regularly , they eat healthily , they 're very conscious about what they put in their bodies - a lot of them wo n't smoke or have alcohol . "
younger users could be at added risk because of a growing enthusiasm for steroids designed for animals .
" they presume that if it 's for an animal it will be much stronger and therefore it will enhance what they want in terms of strength and muscle mass much quicker , " ms jones added .

deputy chief constable of hampshire ian readhead said britain could become a surveillance society with cameras on every street corner .
he told the bbc 's politics show that cctv was being used in small towns and villages where crime rates were low .
mr readhead also called for the retention of some dna evidence and the use of speed cameras to be reviewed .
his force area includes the small town of stockbridge , where parish councillors have spent £ 10,000 installing cctv .
mr readhead questioned whether the relatively low crime levels justified the expense and intrusion .
' every street corner ? '
" i 'm really concerned about what happens to the product of these cameras , and what comes next ? " he said .
" if it 's in our villages , are we really moving towards an orwellian situation where cameras are at every street corner ?
" and i really do n't think that 's the kind of country that i want to live in . "
there are up to 4.2 million cctv cameras in britain - about one for every 14 people .

mr basescu was accused of violating the constitution and was suspended by parliament on 19 april .
he has been locked in a long-running power struggle with his former ally , prime minister calin popescu tariceanu .
data collected from 92 % of polling stations showed 74 % of people voted against impeaching the president .
turnout was about 44 % .
despite the result , a major debate is likely on the future division of powers between parliament and president , says the bbc 's nick thorpe in bucharest .
the president will still be facing his opponents in parliament , who also control the government .
the president has called for them to resign , but legally he can not force them to go , our correspondent says .
the voters had to decide between conflicting views of mr basescu - as a threat to democracy or a political hero pushing for renewal and good governance .
' vote for justice ' prime minister tariceanu , speaking after exit polls on saturday evening , said the low turnout meant it was a victory without glory for the president .
romanian press on the result there were more than 18 million eligible voters , including two million romanians living abroad .
" i voted for our own good , for justice , " iuliana , 70 , a pensioner in timisoara told the bbc .
" why should n't traian basescu be president ?
we voted for him once and now we elect him a second time . "
the opposition social democratic party -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who initiated the impeachment process , describe mr basescu as dictatorial and corrupt , a failure who has never lived up to his constitutional duties .
" i voted for the chance of a new beginning for all those who do n't want scandal and chaos and who want to live in ... a democratic europe , " said sdp head mircea geoana .
the president says his enemies are desperate to stop his anti-corruption drive , which has rattled what he calls " the economic mafia " .
some analysts say only a general election could calm the situation , but the next poll is more than 18 months away .
on friday , foreign minister adrian cioroianu warned that europe 's patience with romania had a limit and that after the referendum , politicians should stop fighting and get back to work .

data collected from 92 % of polling stations showed 74 % of people voted against impeaching the president .
turnout was about 44 % .
despite the result , a major debate is likely on the future division of powers between parliament and president , says the bbc 's nick thorpe in bucharest .
romanians explain how they voted in poll in pictures the president will still be facing his opponents in parliament , who also control the government .
the president has called for them to resign , but legally he can not force them to go , our correspondent says .
the voters had to decide between conflicting views of mr basescu - as a threat to democracy or a political hero pushing for renewal and good governance .
' vote for justice ' prime minister tariceanu , speaking after exit polls on saturday evening , said the low turnout meant it was a victory without glory for the president .
romanian press on the result there were more than 18 million eligible voters , including two million romanians living abroad .
" i voted for our own good , for justice , " iuliana , 70 , a pensioner in timisoara told the bbc .
" why should n't traian basescu be president ?
we voted for him once and now we elect him a second time . "
the opposition social democratic party -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who initiated the impeachment process , describe mr basescu as dictatorial and corrupt , a failure who has never lived up to his constitutional duties .
" i voted for the chance of a new beginning for all those who do n't want scandal and chaos and who want to live in ... a democratic europe , " said sdp head mircea geoana .
the president says his enemies are desperate to stop his anti-corruption drive , which has rattled what he calls " the economic mafia " .
some analysts say only a general election could calm the situation , but the next poll is more than 18 months away .
on friday , foreign minister adrian cioroianu warned that europe 's patience with romania had a limit and that after the referendum , politicians should stop fighting and get back to work .

from sunday , passengers face fare rises of up to 34 % on arriva trains wales services with the withdrawal of the cheapest " walk up " train fares .
a passenger watchdog has criticised the end of the ' supersaver ' fares as " bad news for rail passengers " .
arriva said it was offering " new attractive prices " for long distance travel and encouraging advance booking .
arriva is one of 26 uk rail companies and operates 910 services a day on weekdays across wales and the borders .
the franchise is managed by the welsh assembly government , which along with the uk department of transport , provides an annual subsidy of £ 140m .
until sunday , passengers buying supersaver tickets had been able to walk straight onto a train and travel relatively cheaply , apart from on fridays and saturdays in the summer .
under the price rises the company announced earlier this month , the equivalent ticket from bangor to abergavenny will go up from £ 49.50 to £ 66.20 - a 34 % increase .
the journey from llandudno to cardiff will climb 29 % from £ 59.40 to £ 76.80 and a trip from aberystwyth to wrexham will rise 17 % from £ 30.30 to £ 35.50 .
arriva said it would review prices once again in the autumn arriva said sales of the tickets had fallen by 21 % over the previous three months .
arriva commercial director mike bagshaw said : " arriva trains wales 's new fare structure reflects the way people buy their rail tickets these days .
" for longer journeys people tend to book in advance which is why we have introduced cheap options for north to south travel such as from bangor or llandudno junction to cardiff from as little as £ 15 or £ 9.90 for railcard holders . "
a company spokesman added that it would be reviewing its prices again in the autumn .
but the company 's move was criticised by customer watchdog passenger focus which said it was " bad news for rail passengers " .
stella mair thomas , passenger focus board member for wales , added : " this move further erodes the ability to arrive at the station and buy a ticket for immediate travel .
" we recently carried out a mystery shopping exercise and 25 % of our researchers were unable to buy a ticket either because there were no facilities at the station , or they could n't find a guard on board the train to sell them one . "

keith richards appears as captain jack 's father depp famously based his portrayal of the character on rolling stones guitarist keith richard 's and in this instalment richards makes a cameo appearance playing jack 's father , captain teague .
british actor bill nighy , who returns as captain jack 's arch nemesis davy jones , told the bbc that the success of the pirates series lays in part with depp 's comic turn , which he described as " one of the great performances of recent times " , and the swashbuckling adventure .
but mainly he put it down to the films ' feel-good factor saying : " i know it sounds cheesy but it 's something to do with big heartedness and good spiritedness and you just feel a bit better when you leave the cinema than you did when you went in . "

he said tory leader david cameron 's advisers were largely ex-public schoolboys , and many backbenchers were " very tired of the cameron project " .
a decision to end traditional support for grammars has angered many tory mps .
but education spokesman david willetts defended the policy , and said it was not an attack on existing grammars .
earlier in the week the tories announced they would end their traditional support for such schools and instead take tony blair 's city academies project even further .
backbench anger but it has been denounced as " ridiculous " and " absurd " by some angry tory backbenchers .
on sunday , mr farage said only his party could offer a choice on the issue . "
i think this is a disconnect between the david cameron set and real people " nigel farage " it 's ukip that believes in academic selection and believes in grammar schools - we know they work , " he told bbc one 's am programme .
" the electorate will say : ' what 's the difference between the conservative party and the labour party ? '
the answer is , not very much . "
he accused mr cameron 's " set " of being largely former eton public schoolboys , suggesting they were out of touch with the " real world " .
possible defections " i think this is a disconnect between the david cameron set and real people , " he said .
asked whether the policy would cause tory mps to defect he said there were an " awful lot " of mps who were tired of david cameron 's efforts to change the party .
he added : " whether this proves to be the straw that breaks the camel 's back , i do n't know .
i do think we are not very far away from that point . "
" i am confident that that is going to improve social mobility in this country today " david willetts earlier in the week mr willetts said it was a " fantasy " to say selection at the age of 11 could be fair .
and he said a " shockingly low " number of children from poor backgrounds were getting into grammar schools , while middle class children were being coached to pass the exam .
but on sunday he told the am programme the conservatives were not attacking existing grammar schools .
he said the party wanted to improve social mobility in the " large parts of the country where grammar schools have gone " .
and he said a return to grammar schools would not be feasible or would not tackle the " big problem of declining opportunities in britain today " .
he added : " i am confident that that is going to improve social mobility in this country today which i think is a fundamental conservative principle and i 'm thinking afresh about how we can deliver that in education . "
former conservative leader michael howard , who has been reported to be furious at mr willetts over his speech , has said he is making no comment on the row .
