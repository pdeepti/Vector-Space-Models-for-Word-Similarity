the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky -lrb- left -rrb- , and left party politician gregor gysi congratulate lafontaine however , in a regional election in bremen last month , pds candidates riding a left party ticket won their first seats in a western german state legislature .
the left party wants to stop the social cutbacks of the current government of conservatives and social democrats .
it aims to do more for germany 's long-term jobless which have suffered from the reforms initiated by former chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat .
it is strictly against any peacekeeping assignments abroad for the german armed forces and wants to increase taxes for germany 's rich and big corporations .
lothar bisky 's speech must have been music to some comrades ' ears .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky -lrb- left -rrb- , and left party politician gregor gysi congratulate lafontaine however , in a regional election in bremen last month , pds candidates riding a left party ticket won their first seats in a western german state legislature .
the left party wants to stop the social cutbacks of the current government of conservatives and social democrats .
it aims to do more for germany 's long-term jobless which have suffered from the reforms initiated by former chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat .
it is strictly against any peacekeeping assignments abroad for the german armed forces and wants to increase taxes for germany 's rich and big corporations .
lothar bisky 's speech must have been music to some comrades ' ears .
he said that democratic socialism actually means overcoming the capitalist system in favor of a communist society . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new members flock to join anti-globalization group in germany with the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany just round the corner , attac is booming like never before .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .

" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
" please do n't put europe in jeopardy .
we need a new treaty that will give wings back to our policies , " barroso said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de worried eu leaders call for compromise on eu constitution eu leaders , responding to polish veto threats , called on european governments to compromise on a draft eu constitution treaty at an upcoming summit .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .

but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics .
-lrb- 25.02.2007 -rrb- german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .

more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .

fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .

the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky -lrb- left -rrb- , and left party politician gregor gysi congratulate lafontaine however , in a regional election in bremen last month , pds candidates riding a left party ticket won their first seats in a western german state legislature .
the left party wants to stop the social cutbacks of the current government of conservatives and social democrats .
it aims to do more for germany 's long-term jobless which have suffered from the reforms initiated by former chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat .
it is strictly against any peacekeeping assignments abroad for the german armed forces and wants to increase taxes for germany 's rich and big corporations .
lothar bisky 's speech must have been music to some comrades ' ears .
he said that democratic socialism actually means overcoming the capitalist system in favor of a communist society . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new members flock to join anti-globalization group in germany with the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany just round the corner , attac is booming like never before .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .

such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .

fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .

news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
" please do n't put europe in jeopardy .
we need a new treaty that will give wings back to our policies , " barroso said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de worried eu leaders call for compromise on eu constitution eu leaders , responding to polish veto threats , called on european governments to compromise on a draft eu constitution treaty at an upcoming summit .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?

we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .

it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
" please do n't put europe in jeopardy .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .
neither is beholden to the anti-american gaullist or socialist legacies .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky -lrb- left -rrb- , and left party politician gregor gysi congratulate lafontaine however , in a regional election in bremen last month , pds candidates riding a left party ticket won their first seats in a western german state legislature .
the left party wants to stop the social cutbacks of the current government of conservatives and social democrats .
it aims to do more for germany 's long-term jobless which have suffered from the reforms initiated by former chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat .
it is strictly against any peacekeeping assignments abroad for the german armed forces and wants to increase taxes for germany 's rich and big corporations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .

steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .

after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
" please do n't put europe in jeopardy .
we need a new treaty that will give wings back to our policies , " barroso said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de worried eu leaders call for compromise on eu constitution eu leaders , responding to polish veto threats , called on european governments to compromise on a draft eu constitution treaty at an upcoming summit .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 german leftists launch united political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left joined forces to become the left members of a newly-formed german political party resulting from the merger of two left-wing groupings called for reviving the social state on saturday , during their first conference . the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which is the successor organization to the east german communist party , and a group of disgruntled former social democrats and trade unionists , known as electoral alternative for work and justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , agreed on saturday to name the new organization the left .
they elected as co-chairmen oskar lafontaine , a former social democratic party leader and federal finance minister , and lothar bisky from the pds .
" we are the only party which challenges the -lrb- capitalist -rrb- system , " lafontaine told delegates .
" we want to reintroduce the social state . "
although the party 's name is nominally new , traditions and rituals within germany 's left party will stay the same .
the internationale - the hymn of the worldwide workers ' movement - as well as the term comrade , with which left party members still proudly address one another , betray the party 's strong roots in the socialist ideology of the previous century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine in the era of globalization , however , the party believes they have a strong cause , seeing as the mainstream social democrats here have abandoned socialist policies in favor of what the leftists denounce as blatant neo-liberalism .
the spd 's move to the right was the reason many former social democrats left the party in recent years - first to form the wasg , and now the left party .
moving west the two parties already took part in the 2005 general election under the name the left and earned 8.7 percent of the vote to become the second-biggest opposition group in parliament .
even so , the merger was n't uncontested within the wasg .
a group of renegades - who have now left the party - argued that the former eastern german communists of the pds were power hungry and supported socially unjust policies through coalitions in a number of regional governments .
and indeed , the amalgamation appears mainly to be a chance for the pds to expand into western germany .
for almost two decades it 's been unsuccessfully striving for recognition there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky -lrb- left -rrb- , and left party politician gregor gysi congratulate lafontaine however , in a regional election in bremen last month , pds candidates riding a left party ticket won their first seats in a western german state legislature .
the left party wants to stop the social cutbacks of the current government of conservatives and social democrats .
it aims to do more for germany 's long-term jobless which have suffered from the reforms initiated by former chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat .
it is strictly against any peacekeeping assignments abroad for the german armed forces and wants to increase taxes for germany 's rich and big corporations .
lothar bisky 's speech must have been music to some comrades ' ears .

the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.06.2007 the french right 's power gain has some worried großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's national assembly : soon flooded by the " blue wave ? "
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .
neither is beholden to the anti-american gaullist or socialist legacies .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .

the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .

" it 's good for our future .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
" please do n't put europe in jeopardy .
we need a new treaty that will give wings back to our policies , " barroso said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de worried eu leaders call for compromise on eu constitution eu leaders , responding to polish veto threats , called on european governments to compromise on a draft eu constitution treaty at an upcoming summit .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .
warsaw 's position was " unhelpful , " barroso told saturday 's edition of german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .

germany , the eu 's most populous country and an economic powerhouse , is determined to use a summit starting in brussels on thursday to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
but poland , which with 38 million inhabitants was the biggest of 10 new eu entrants in 2004 , has threatened to veto the talks on a new text because it believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
warsaw wants the number of votes a country has in decisions affecting the entire eu to be based on the square root of the country 's population and argues that the double majority method that germany favors would give large countries too much influence in important votes .
warsaw : germany should step back the conservative , populist kaczynski twins , lech and jaroslaw , who hold the positions of polish president and prime minister respectively , have made opposition to the treaty a central feature of their policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind these doors will remain a secret until the eu summit warsaw signaled on friday that it was not prepared to cave into pressure from its eu counterparts - spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and french president nicolas sarkozy both visited warsaw towards the end of the week .
" there are only breakthroughs in negotiations at the end of the negotiations , " marek cichocki , the polish official in charge of preparing for the summit , told afp .
" we can still find a good compromise . "
he called on germany to " take a step backwards , " saying that such a move would be a sign " that they take us seriously in political terms in europe and want a real partnership . "
a member of merkel 's team said there would be no public announcement of the outcome of saturday 's discussions which were being held at a castle in meseberg outside berlin .
" the results will be known next week in brussels , " the official said .
czech troubles , too after hearing poland 's concerns , merkel will see czech prime minister mirek topolanek in meseberg on sunday before continuing her breathless pre-summit round of negotiations by meeting prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg .
merkel , who has said she is determined to retain the " substance " of the original treaty , also faces an uneasy time with the czechs , whose president vaclav klaus has complained that " only cosmetic changes have been made " to the original text .
plea from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso eu commission chief jose manuel barroso warned poland against blocking the implementation of reforms for an eu that has almost doubled in size in the space of three years and can not function with its current decision-making system .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .

the going has n't always been easy , but fair trade has made big inroads into the mainstream here . transfair , the german fair trade initiative , started in 1992 as a good idea with a confusing name .
the cafe of small farmers consortium caused plenty of misunderstandings , said dieter overath , who has headed the organization from the beginning .
he was getting calls from small german farmers asking whether they could join the group .
it became clear they needed a better name as well as a good logo , overath said .
" there were no instructions how someone would build such an initiative , " he said after debate , they came up with the transfair name and the logo .
but they still had a big task ahead of them .
how could one convince the fair trade skeptics ?
would consumers willingly pay a higher price for coffee to help farmers in a country such as nicaragua ?
initial skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this logo is a common sight in german supermarkets the first phone call to a buyer at a large chain was sobering .
he said : " the german housewife will not pay a cent more than is needed .
end of story . "
and hung up .
but the truth was the german housewife would pay more .
at the women 's world day of prayer in 1993 , roman catholic and protestant women went to supermarkets in groups and demanded fair trade products .
in february 1993 the german grocery giant rewe became the first supermarket in the country to offer transfair coffee .
pretty soon , other supermarkets started selling it as well .
the demands of these women made the difference , overath said .
that was always important , since transfair never had millions of euros to spend on advertising , overath said .
" they showed the stores that there are consumers that want this and are ready to spend more on fair trade products , " overath said .
quality important selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fair trade jeans are expected soon while fair trade started with coffee , they added new products in the following years such as honey , tea , orange juice , chocolate and sweets .
the products tasted better and the packaging was attractive .
but just as the demand picked up , new problems surfaced .
transfair had to enter into a difficult price war .
coffee sales stagnated .
the first attempt at getting fair trade bananas to market had delivery problems due to hurricane mitch in 1998 .
the media also began criticizing the group .
news organizations drew attention to a report that was critical of how a cooperative in ghana was spending its money .
public skepticism mounted .
for transfair that meant moving away from thinking exclusively about bettering the living conditions of the producers to thinking more about marketing and consumers . consumers do n't expect to change the world when they go shopping .
finding a superior product is the important thing , " overath said .
" -lrb- the consumer -rrb- has to have a feeling from fair trade that when he pays a little more , he will get a good product . "
along with doing a better job of marketing fair trade to current clients , there 's also a move to large-scale consumption .
fair trade products are finding their way into company lunchrooms and university cafeterias and are also used by companies such as air berlin , germany 's second biggest airline .
a growth market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter overath of germany 's transfair new products continue to surface : wine , roses , rice and even fair trade soccer balls .
fair trade has also profited in recent years from the boom in organic products .
last year in germany , the market had a 100 percent growth rate .
more importantly , fair trade has proven it 's an effective form of development politics .
fair trade cotton and cocoa farmers are not risking their lives on overcrowded boats to reach the canary islands , overath said .
the people are staying home and using their pay to finance better futures for their children .
fair trade wants to strengthen its activities in africa and also bring fair trade cotton to the german market .
men will soon be able to buy fair trade jeans .
overath hopes that fair trade products will continue becoming part of the mainstream and become as normal for germans as buying organic products has in recent years . monika hoegen -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fair trade blooms in germany producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

"
the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority . for some , the overwhelming majority nicolas sarkozy will likely enjoy in parliament after sunday 's second round of legislative elections are cause for serious concern .
others say it should be welcomed , since it will allow the president to break through the political bottleneck to reform that modernizers say is crippling the country .
in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2007 controversial school language ban appears to be working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students have to speak german on school grounds two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere . at break-time at herbert hoover secondary school , taner , mohammed and tugba frequently discuss the results of the süper league , turkey 's top-flight football competition .
not so strange for three youngsters of turkish origin perhaps .
but what is unusual is that the students , whose mother tongue is turkish , are discussing the topic in german .
" if the teachers hear that we are speaking turkish , then they say to us : speak german , " explains one of the boys .
" it 's good for our future .
in every job , we have to talk in german , " says another .
herbert hoover secondary school in berlin unleashed a storm of debate when it made speaking german on school grounds and on educational excursions compulsory .
harsh criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students in inner-city berlin do n't speak german as their mother tongue school principal jutta steinkamp was accused of discriminating against immigrant children by members of the left party .
but last year the german national foundation awarded hoover school with a 75,000 euro -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- prize , saying the school helped immigrant pupils to improve their language skills .
and steinkamp said an external commission of experts has just said the introduction of the measure has improved discipline and academic standards .
and the idea is being taken up by other schools at both home and abroad .
" we had a lot of aggression .
and pupils i talked to , they said : well , there are quite a lot of misunderstandings and there are the different languages , we do n't understand them , perhaps it was an aggressive word , i do n't know and so our pupils started to fight with each other , " said steinkamp .
widely accepted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this strict language policy is said to be paying off in the classroom the teachers do not have to enforce the ban with sanctions , she adds , because most pupils have accepted the rule by now .
at home , nine out of 10 of her students do n't speak german .
turkish , polish or russian are more common .
" school is the only occasion where they speak german .
i mean it 's natural that in their communities , in their families they speak in their mother tongue .
so they have to practice it here .
where else ?
where else could they do it ? "
steinkamp says the commission confirmed the positive effects on her pupils ' average grades .
that 's why other schools in germany have already started copying the model .
swedish and british schools have also expressed an interest .
but , 10th-grader tugba says , the regulation does n't always suit her .
when she talks about boys with her turkish friends , she simply has to switch back to her mother tongue .
some things are just easier to explain in turkish . peter hille -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy persists over immigrant language instruction in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education .

in the first round on june 10th , sarkozy 's party , the ump , garnered 10.3 million votes .
the ump and its new partners , the new center and the traditionalist , conservative breakaway " movement for france , " were able to capture just under 46 percent of the vote .
and the many still undecided electoral districts mean that the ump 's chances of getting an absolute majority are very good .
it appears that sarkozy has been able to pull off in 2007 what center-right german chancellor angela merkel could not back in 2005 - obtain a clear mandate from the voters .
it is the first time in france 's fifth republic that a newly elected head of state has received such a large majority .
lack of a counterweight but french political scientist henri menudier warns against reading this concentration of political power in one man or one party as a danger to democracy .
there is no need , according to him , to fear this new power center .
" france has n't become a fascist state , " he said .
" but what is alarming is the near lack of any kind of political counterweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has an unprecedented amount of power in his hands in the parliament , the national assembly , only sarkozy 's government coalition and the socialist will have factional representation .
the smaller parties did not make it over the required hurdle of twenty seats .
the new centrist party of francois bayrou , democratic movement -lrb- modem -rrb- , entered the legislative race with 520 candidates , but according to the prognoses will end up with no more than four members in the legislature .
on the left , the story is the same .
the communist party , once one of the most powerful political groups in the country , got only 4.3 percent of the vote in the first round .
the greens did worse with only 3.3 percent .
even the extreme-right national front could not resist sarkozy 's " blue wave , " seeing its worst results since 1981 .
only one of its candidates has a chance of getting into the national assembly , marine le pen , daughter of party founder jean-marie le pen .
bi-polar politics the poor performance of the smaller parties in france will , in the long run , serve to marginalize them , says political scientist menudier .
they will receive less financial support from the government and they will have fewer opportunities to get their message across , since the loss of parliamentary group status limits their speaking time in the assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform of the french voting system is being discussed in france , the majority voting system tends to strongly distort the real power relationships in the country .
and today that distortion is more extreme than it ever has been .
that has led to the revival of discussions about reforming the voting system .
voices calling for such reform are getting louder .
but this new two-party reality will not necessarily tip french democracy into crisis , according to the head of the french-german institute , frank baasner .
that is , if sarkozy follows through on his promises of reform , namely , to strengthen the power of parliament and introduce a " dose of proportional voting law . "
when are the reforms coming ?
such reform is especially important , according to menudier , since the french president and the parliament are elected for five-year terms .
when presidential terms were seven years , people often used the parliamentary elections to punish the head of state for his unpopular policies .
but the latest legislative election took place just five weeks after sarkozy won a resounding victory , leaving no time for the public to judge whether or not they liked their new leader and his leadership .
" it 's is absolutely necessary to reform the voting system , " said menudier .
however , experts generally do not believe sarkozy will tackle this kind of structural reform during his first term in office .
his first priority will likely be his program of rupture , which includes reforming the social system and bringing down the unemployment rate .
despite his overwhelming political majority , that will not be an easy task .
in france , presidents have often had the brakes put to their plans by pressure from the street - nothing brings french protesters out en masse like talk of reform . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .

neither is beholden to the anti-american gaullist or socialist legacies .

roger m. buergel : we have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible , and there is a small manageable catalogue .
your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a pr strategy .
how do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to documenta ?
do you see documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger m. buergel and his partner , ruth noack , are in charge of the documenta no , insofar as i believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business .
documenta should n't be a film festival , dance festival , art exhibition and science convention .
yes , in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange .
i am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because i do n't want to take part in this neurotic game .
scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people 's view of the art .
it should n't be about the individual artists , but about the exhibition as a whole .
the works exist within their own context and that 's what the visitors should concentrate on .
you have selected unknowns over high profile names .
is it really possible to produce a documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world ?
in contrast to most big art events , which are very privileged , we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters .
of course , we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world , but we do n't just do that .
the holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition , which is happening at the venice biennale , i would never allow here .
and whether it 's venice , basel or miami , many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly .
but art is a very slow process , it ca n't be made haphazardly .
i do n't want meaningless art from opportunists , who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years .
for the first time in the history of documents include antiquities .
why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a temporary structure that looks like a greenhouse was erected for additional exhibition space one can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from .
that makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future .
i 'm not trying to show what is contemporary , but to illustrate where certain forms come from .
our oldest exhibit is a persian design from the 14th century , which was produced after an expedition by persian artists to the chinese imperial palace .
looking at it , you can see how the persians were influenced by chinese forms .
i wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition , in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated .
and i have a responsibility to the educational role of documenta .
the spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you .
you built new exhibitions spaces in kassel , in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another .
do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public ?
the viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves , and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation .
creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits .
for me , the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art .
the book " homo sacer : sovereign power and bare life " by giorgio agamben is at the center of the exhibition .
topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work .
in what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in documenta 12 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terraces of rice plants from thai artist sakarin krue-on are part of documenta 12 it wo n't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers , but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition .
in that sense it is very political .
however , we have n't selected works based on their politics , but rather those that further educate the general public .
this documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers .
has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous documentas ?
even though film is close to our hearts , it is only featured selectively in documenta 12 .
we do n't want to confine moving pictures to a black box .
in our view , film has had its place here ever since the first documenta - at the gloria cinema .
a bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world .
how do you overcome that attitude from viewers , that they have already seen everything ?
it 's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown , but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them .
we want to remind people to look at things more closely .
documenta 12 opened to the public june 16 and runs until sept .

the amazon is recognised as the world 's largest river by volume , but has generally been regarded as second in length to the river nile .
the claim follows an expedition to peru that is said to have established a new starting point further south .

mountain source the precise length of a river is not easy to calculate and depends on correctly identifying the source and the mouth .

while the exact location has yet to be confirmed from two choices , scientists say either would make the river the longest in the world .
guido gelli , director of science at the brazilian institute of geography and statistics , told the brazilian network tv globo that today it could already be considered as a fact that the amazon was the longest river in the world .
the amazon is now said to begin in an ice-covered mountain in southern peru called mismi .
researchers travelled for 14 days , sometimes in freezing temperatures , to establish the location at an altitude of 5,000m .
the research was co-ordinated by the national geographical institute of peru , with the help of their colleagues in brazil .
there has been a healthy academic debate over the world 's longest river for some years and the claim from brazil may not go unchallenged .

his fatah faction has been ousted from gaza by rival hamas militants , ending a week of fierce feuding in which at least 100 people died .
after talks in cairo , arab league foreign ministers urged hamas and fatah to end their rivalry and co-operate .
a key hamas leader earlier said he remained willing to work with mr abbas .
khaled meshaal , hamas 's political leader , who lives in exile in syria , said mr abbas remained the " legitimate " president .
however , hamas declared as illegal an earlier decree by mr abbas that replaced its prime minister , ismail haniya .
mr abbas , who is in the west bank , named former finance minister salam fayyad as his new prime minister after dissolving the hamas-led national unity government .
us support following emergency talks between arab league foreign ministers , the body 's spokesman , amr moussa , said there must be an " immediate and full halt " to the violence , which he described as criminal .
gazans tell of fears images : abbas office stormed gaza troubles egypt 's press " we are seeking a national unity in palestine and we stand against the events that we have witnessed in the last days , " he said .
he said arab nations wanted to " serve the palestinian cause , and not one faction against another " .
the arab league agreed to form a committee that would support efforts by saudi arabia and egypt to mediate between fatah and hamas .
according to the bbc 's heba saleh in cairo , these arab governments regard the palestinian problem as a festering sore breeding militancy and radicalising populations in the region .
the group of middle east mediators known as the quartet - the us , un , eu and russia - have also thrown their weight behind mr abbas , pledging him their " full support " .
a us state department spokesman said the quartet was examining ways of helping a new palestinian government , headed by mr abbas 's nominee .
" this is a government that intends to abide by the principles that previous palestinian governments had prior to the hamas-led government , " the spokesman , sean mccormack , said .
western boycott president abbas dismissed the three-month-old unity government on thursday and declared a state of emergency .
salam fayyad born in 1952 near west bank city of tulkarm holds a phd in economics from the university of texas worked at the world bank in washington from 1987-1995 imf representative to palestine until 2001 finance minister under the fatah-controlled administration from 2002-2005 credited with cracking down on official corruption profile : salam fayyad q & a : gaza chaos how hamas took over he said he would rule by presidential decree until the conditions were right for early elections .
his nominee to replace mr haniya , mr fayyad , is a former world bank economist .
western nations have boycotted hamas , considered a terrorist organisation by the us and eu , since it won elections in january 2006 .
the bbc 's matthew price in jerusalem says the west bank and gaza strip will now effectively be split from one another - gaza run by the islamist hamas and the west bank by the secular fatah .
there are also fears that violence will spread to the west bank , where fatah is dominant .
human rights watch has urged both factions to treat civilians humanely and prevent summary killings .
joe stork , deputy middle east director , said : " killing people who are in your custody and under your control ... constitutes an extremely grave offence , in fact , a war crime . "

his fatah faction has been ousted from gaza by rival hamas militants , ending a week of fierce feuding in which at least 100 people died .
after talks in cairo , arab league foreign ministers urged hamas and fatah to end their rivalry and co-operate .
a key hamas leader earlier said he remained willing to work with mr abbas .
khaled meshaal , hamas 's political leader , who lives in exile in syria , said mr abbas remained the " legitimate " president .
however , hamas declared as illegal an earlier decree by mr abbas that replaced its prime minister , ismail haniya .
mr abbas , who is in the west bank , named former finance minister salam fayyad as his new prime minister after dissolving the hamas-led national unity government .
us support following emergency talks between arab league foreign ministers , the body 's spokesman , amr moussa , said there must be an " immediate and full halt " to the violence , which he described as criminal .
gazans tell of fears images : abbas office stormed gaza troubles egypt 's press " we are seeking a national unity in palestine and we stand against the events that we have witnessed in the last days , " he said .
he said arab nations wanted to " serve the palestinian cause , and not one faction against another " .
the arab league agreed to form a committee that would support efforts by saudi arabia and egypt to mediate between fatah and hamas .
according to the bbc 's heba saleh in cairo , these arab governments regard the palestinian problem as a festering sore breeding militancy and radicalising populations in the region .
the group of middle east mediators known as the quartet - the us , un , eu and russia - have also thrown their weight behind mr abbas , pledging him their " full support " .
a us state department spokesman said the quartet was examining ways of helping a new palestinian government , headed by mr abbas 's nominee .
" this is a government that intends to abide by the principles that previous palestinian governments had prior to the hamas-led government , " the spokesman , sean mccormack , said .
western boycott president abbas dismissed the three-month-old unity government on thursday and declared a state of emergency .
salam fayyad born in 1952 near west bank city of tulkarm holds a phd in economics from the university of texas worked at the world bank in washington from 1987-1995 imf representative to palestine until 2001 finance minister under the fatah-controlled administration from 2002-2005 credited with cracking down on official corruption profile : salam fayyad q & a : gaza chaos how hamas took over he said he would rule by presidential decree until the conditions were right for early elections .
his nominee to replace mr haniya , mr fayyad , is a former world bank economist .
western nations have boycotted hamas , considered a terrorist organisation by the us and eu , since it won elections in january 2006 .
the bbc 's matthew price in jerusalem says the west bank and gaza strip will now effectively be split from one another - gaza run by the islamist hamas and the west bank by the secular fatah .
there are also fears that violence will spread to the west bank , where fatah is dominant .
human rights watch has urged both factions to treat civilians humanely and prevent summary killings .
joe stork , deputy middle east director , said : " killing people who are in your custody and under your control ... constitutes an extremely grave offence , in fact , a war crime . "

mine-clearing operations are tiny in comparison with the problem donkeys wander amid the mud huts , and women in traditional colourful headscarves shy away from visitors .
a group of small children , happily oblivious to the poverty that surrounds them , scream and laugh as they chase a dog along a stream .
none of these children were born when the government and the opposition fought for control of these mountains .
yet , in a way , for these children the war is still on , a decade after the ceasefire .
diligently , with his hands folded on his knees , 10-year-old samir told us his story .
two years ago , samir went to cut wood in the forest and found a shiny metal ball .
he had no idea , he said , that it was a cluster bomblet .
samir only survived because he threw it a long way , but the blast shattered his knee and left him half blind .
hundreds of others have not been so lucky .
ten years since they were dropped , unexploded cluster munitions are still killing people here .
according to the un , that makes tajikistan a perfect example of why the weapon should be banned .
lack of funds international efforts to ban cluster bombs gained new force after last year 's war between israel and hezbollah , when israel dropped an estimated four million cluster bombs on southern lebanon .
cluster bombs are believed to be stockpiled by at least 75 countries around the world , including the us and britain .
i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others , and maybe cure myself too samir , aged 10 when dropped they disperse into hundreds of smaller bomblets , or sub-munitions - and that is what , according to the un , makes them more dangerous and vicious than landmines .
" the worst thing is that you simply do n't know where they are , " said andy smith , who works for the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- and advises the tajik government on mine clearance .
" at least with the landmines you can predict where they have been laid .
but cluster sub-munitions spread over vast territories , and they continue to move around , " he said .
" they can be shifted by snow , or roll down the hills , and unlike landmines they do n't rust away but stay armed for decades . "
the undp is among several international organisations that are trying to help tajikistan rid itself of mines and cluster munitions .
but their effort is undermined by a lack of funds .
working on one of the steep hills of the rashd valley , three men in blue uniforms are sweeping the area with bright yellow detectors - a miniscule operation considering the scale of the problem .
what makes clearance ever more difficult is that next year 's snow melt is likely to send more bomblets down the hill and towards the villages .
" yesterday we found seven sub-munitions at the bottom of just this one gulley ; there are thousands of them here , " andy smith said .
life without work the problem of unexploded munitions and landmines spreads far beyond the rashd valley .
tajikistan 's border with afghanistan is full of landmines - a legacy of the soviet occupation of afghanistan .
more recently another neighbour , uzbekistan , mined its frontier with the country , saying it needed to prevent terrorists from crossing .
tajikistan could be mine-free in five years , the un 's andy smith says " we do n't have a record of a single terrorist being hurt by mines there , but there certainly have been plenty of civilians , " said jonmahamad rajabov , head of the tajik mine action cell , a government agency that deals with the issue .
landmines and unexploded munitions have not only claimed hundreds of lives here , they have also destroyed thousands of livelihoods .
in a country where jobs are scarce , losing a leg or an arm means a lifetime of unemployment - and if the victim is a breadwinner , it means poverty for the entire family too .
when a cluster bomb exploded near his house , saygufron abdulhayrov lost both his arms .
his cousin died in the blast .
elsewhere , he might have considered himself lucky to have survived , but in tajikistan his injury means he now faces a lifetime without work .
the help he gets from the government is enough to buy him 20 loaves of bread a month .
" what is there for me to do ?
i can never find a job , i can never own a shop or do anything with my life , " saygufron said .
but even those who are not injured or dead are still victims here .
about 93 % of this country is mountainous , so every inch of flat land is precious .
in the countryside , where most people eat what they grow , mines and sub-munitions are halting agricultural development .
their clearance , the government says , is essential for the economic revival that tajikistan so desperately needs .
in the village of chor charokh , like so much of rural tajikistan , there are hardly any men left .
samir 's father , like many others , has left to search for work in russia .
the 10-year-old , in the meantime , is making his own plans for the future .
" i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others - and maybe , " samir added , " cure myself too " .
it is not an impossible dream .
samir 's vision could probably be restored , but his family does not have the money to take him to the city hospital .
money is also needed to make this land safe to walk on and farm .
" we need more detectors , more assets , more men , " the un 's andy smith explained .
" with the right investment we could make this country mine-safe in three years and mine-free in five .
without this investment , it could take another 100 years . "
while tajikistan desperately needs aid , the world , according to the un , needs an international treaty banning cluster bombs , preventing this from happening elsewhere .

diligently , with his hands folded on his knees , 10-year-old samir told us his story .
two years ago , samir went to cut wood in the forest and found a shiny metal ball .
he had no idea , he said , that it was a cluster bomblet .
samir only survived because he threw it a long way , but the blast shattered his knee and left him half blind .
hundreds of others have not been so lucky .
ten years since they were dropped , unexploded cluster munitions are still killing people here .
according to the un , that makes tajikistan a perfect example of why the weapon should be banned .
lack of funds international efforts to ban cluster bombs gained new force after last year 's war between israel and hezbollah , when israel dropped an estimated four million cluster bombs on southern lebanon .
cluster bombs are believed to be stockpiled by at least 75 countries around the world , including the us and britain .
i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others , and maybe cure myself too samir , aged 10 when dropped they disperse into hundreds of smaller bomblets , or sub-munitions - and that is what , according to the un , makes them more dangerous and vicious than landmines .
" the worst thing is that you simply do n't know where they are , " said andy smith , who works for the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- and advises the tajik government on mine clearance .
" at least with the landmines you can predict where they have been laid .
but cluster sub-munitions spread over vast territories , and they continue to move around , " he said .
" they can be shifted by snow , or roll down the hills , and unlike landmines they do n't rust away but stay armed for decades . "
the undp is among several international organisations that are trying to help tajikistan rid itself of mines and cluster munitions .
but their effort is undermined by a lack of funds .
working on one of the steep hills of the rashd valley , three men in blue uniforms are sweeping the area with bright yellow detectors - a miniscule operation considering the scale of the problem .
what makes clearance ever more difficult is that next year 's snow melt is likely to send more bomblets down the hill and towards the villages .
" yesterday we found seven sub-munitions at the bottom of just this one gulley ; there are thousands of them here , " andy smith said .
life without work the problem of unexploded munitions and landmines spreads far beyond the rashd valley .
tajikistan 's border with afghanistan is full of landmines - a legacy of the soviet occupation of afghanistan .
more recently another neighbour , uzbekistan , mined its frontier with the country , saying it needed to prevent terrorists from crossing .
tajikistan could be mine-free in five years , the un 's andy smith says " we do n't have a record of a single terrorist being hurt by mines there , but there certainly have been plenty of civilians , " said jonmahamad rajabov , head of the tajik mine action cell , a government agency that deals with the issue .
landmines and unexploded munitions have not only claimed hundreds of lives here , they have also destroyed thousands of livelihoods .
in a country where jobs are scarce , losing a leg or an arm means a lifetime of unemployment - and if the victim is a breadwinner , it means poverty for the entire family too .
when a cluster bomb exploded near his house , saygufron abdulhayrov lost both his arms .
his cousin died in the blast .
elsewhere , he might have considered himself lucky to have survived , but in tajikistan his injury means he now faces a lifetime without work .
the help he gets from the government is enough to buy him 20 loaves of bread a month .
" what is there for me to do ?
i can never find a job , i can never own a shop or do anything with my life , " saygufron said .
but even those who are not injured or dead are still victims here .
about 93 % of this country is mountainous , so every inch of flat land is precious .
in the countryside , where most people eat what they grow , mines and sub-munitions are halting agricultural development .
their clearance , the government says , is essential for the economic revival that tajikistan so desperately needs .
in the village of chor charokh , like so much of rural tajikistan , there are hardly any men left .
samir 's father , like many others , has left to search for work in russia .
the 10-year-old , in the meantime , is making his own plans for the future .
" i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others - and maybe , " samir added , " cure myself too " .
it is not an impossible dream .
samir 's vision could probably be restored , but his family does not have the money to take him to the city hospital .
money is also needed to make this land safe to walk on and farm .
" we need more detectors , more assets , more men , " the un 's andy smith explained .
" with the right investment we could make this country mine-safe in three years and mine-free in five .
without this investment , it could take another 100 years . "
while tajikistan desperately needs aid , the world , according to the un , needs an international treaty banning cluster bombs , preventing this from happening elsewhere .

but their effort is undermined by a lack of funds .
working on one of the steep hills of the rashd valley , three men in blue uniforms are sweeping the area with bright yellow detectors - a miniscule operation considering the scale of the problem .
what makes clearance ever more difficult is that next year 's snow melt is likely to send more bomblets down the hill and towards the villages .
" yesterday we found seven sub-munitions at the bottom of just this one gulley ; there are thousands of them here , " andy smith said .
life without work the problem of unexploded munitions and landmines spreads far beyond the rashd valley .
tajikistan 's border with afghanistan is full of landmines - a legacy of the soviet occupation of afghanistan .
more recently another neighbour , uzbekistan , mined its frontier with the country , saying it needed to prevent terrorists from crossing .
tajikistan could be mine-free in five years , the un 's andy smith says " we do n't have a record of a single terrorist being hurt by mines there , but there certainly have been plenty of civilians , " said jonmahamad rajabov , head of the tajik mine action cell , a government agency that deals with the issue .
landmines and unexploded munitions have not only claimed hundreds of lives here , they have also destroyed thousands of livelihoods .
in a country where jobs are scarce , losing a leg or an arm means a lifetime of unemployment - and if the victim is a breadwinner , it means poverty for the entire family too .
when a cluster bomb exploded near his house , saygufron abdulhayrov lost both his arms .
his cousin died in the blast .
elsewhere , he might have considered himself lucky to have survived , but in tajikistan his injury means he now faces a lifetime without work .
the help he gets from the government is enough to buy him 20 loaves of bread a month .
" what is there for me to do ?
i can never find a job , i can never own a shop or do anything with my life , " saygufron said .
but even those who are not injured or dead are still victims here .
about 93 % of this country is mountainous , so every inch of flat land is precious .
in the countryside , where most people eat what they grow , mines and sub-munitions are halting agricultural development .
their clearance , the government says , is essential for the economic revival that tajikistan so desperately needs .
in the village of chor charokh , like so much of rural tajikistan , there are hardly any men left .
samir 's father , like many others , has left to search for work in russia .
the 10-year-old , in the meantime , is making his own plans for the future .
" i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others - and maybe , " samir added , " cure myself too " .
it is not an impossible dream .
samir 's vision could probably be restored , but his family does not have the money to take him to the city hospital .
money is also needed to make this land safe to walk on and farm .
" we need more detectors , more assets , more men , " the un 's andy smith explained .
" with the right investment we could make this country mine-safe in three years and mine-free in five .
without this investment , it could take another 100 years . "
while tajikistan desperately needs aid , the world , according to the un , needs an international treaty banning cluster bombs , preventing this from happening elsewhere .

donkeys wander amid the mud huts , and women in traditional colourful headscarves shy away from visitors .
a group of small children , happily oblivious to the poverty that surrounds them , scream and laugh as they chase a dog along a stream .
none of these children were born when the government and the opposition fought for control of these mountains .
yet , in a way , for these children the war is still on , a decade after the ceasefire .
diligently , with his hands folded on his knees , 10-year-old samir told us his story .
two years ago , samir went to cut wood in the forest and found a shiny metal ball .
he had no idea , he said , that it was a cluster bomblet .
samir only survived because he threw it a long way , but the blast shattered his knee and left him half blind .
hundreds of others have not been so lucky .
ten years since they were dropped , unexploded cluster munitions are still killing people here .
according to the un , that makes tajikistan a perfect example of why the weapon should be banned .
lack of funds international efforts to ban cluster bombs gained new force after last year 's war between israel and hezbollah , when israel dropped an estimated four million cluster bombs on southern lebanon .
cluster bombs are believed to be stockpiled by at least 75 countries around the world , including the us and britain . "
i want to become an eye doctor so that i can help others , and maybe cure myself too " samir , aged 10 when dropped they disperse into hundreds of smaller bomblets , or sub-munitions - and that is what , according to the un , makes them more dangerous and vicious than landmines .
" the worst thing is that you simply do n't know where they are , " said andy smith , who works for the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- and advises the tajik government on mine clearance .
" at least with the landmines you can predict where they have been laid .
but cluster sub-munitions spread over vast territories , and they continue to move around , " he said .
" they can be shifted by snow , or roll down the hills , and unlike landmines they do n't rust away but stay armed for decades . "
the undp is among several international organisations that are trying to help tajikistan rid itself of mines and cluster munitions .

five live report 's phil kemp investigated two teenagers ' experiences .
nick was 16 when he set up a personal profile on faceparty , a social networking website - something an estimated nine out of 10 teenagers now do .
it was n't long before people he did n't know were getting in touch and asking him to go on his webcam .
" they said : ' i could pay you if you want . '
i was like , ' ok , fair enough . '
if there 's a bit of money involved , there 's a bit of incentive . "
as with many other teenagers , nick 's computer and his webcam are in his bedroom .
these cameras that film you at your desk often come built-in with new computers or you can buy them separately for under £ 10 .
' camgirls ' by creating a profile on a popular website , nick has become one of the growing number of " camgirls " and " camboys " offering webcam sex shows for money .
nick remembers why he was tempted the first time someone suggested paying him .
" the xbox 360 had just come out and games were about 50 quid .
" i was thinking , ' if i could do this on a regular basis , i could have a lot of games ' . "
the child exploitation and online protection agency -lrb- ceop -rrb- says it has been receiving a growing number of reports of unsolicited requests to young people , asking them to perform sex shows .
ceop 's chief executive jim gamble describes it as a growing trend , although some of the cases now coming to light date back several years .
they can involve money paid via online transfer services such as paypal , best known for its use on auction websites .
this would breach paypal 's terms and conditions but the company says it is unable to monitor every transaction that is made .
at risk but ceop warns that children without a bank account or other means of being paid money online are also at risk .
" they 're being engaged with the offer of credits for other areas in gaming sites , in particular , to commit sexual acts on webcam , " says mr gamble .
on these websites , credits can be bought with real money and it 's these that ceop says are being used to coax young people into turning on their webcams . "
i quit college because the money was so good ...
i would have about 10 to 15 a day , which would be about £ 100 to £ 150 " sarah sarah also created a profile on the faceparty website when she was 16 .
she started offering cam shows when she saw other girls doing the same in the website 's chatroom .
" i quit college because the money was so good .
i would have about 10 to 15 a day , which would be about £ 100 to £ 150 . "
sarah says even when she was 16 , people paying for her shows would ask to meet her in person for sex .
she says she always refused .
mr gamble warns that paying for webcam sex shows with children under the age of 18 , even without physical contact , is just as illegal as child prostitution .
any prosecution could result in a lengthy jail sentence .
" it 's no different in the virtual world .
if you become involved in this type of activity , there will be a consequence .
you 're damaging and harming a child , " says gamble .
' degrading ' ceop also warns that teenagers are themselves risking prosecution by publishing indecent material of someone aged under 18 .
sarah 's now 20 and she regrets having given up her studies for the money she was making with her webcam .
" if i could go back , i would n't have ever started doing it .
you look back on it and it 's quite degrading . "

the child exploitation and online protection agency -lrb- ceop -rrb- says it has been receiving a growing number of reports of unsolicited requests to young people , asking them to perform sex shows .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- moneybox -pipe- have your say : advice commission bbc news / moneybox graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 16 june 2007 , 09:42 gmt 10:42 uk have your say : advice commission financial advisers should no longer be paid by commission , says the panel which represents consumer interests to the regulator .
john howard , chairman of the financial services consumer panel says mis-selling scandals can be traced back to commission .
and he says consumer confidence in financial services would be restored if commission was ended .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed . "
people should have the right to choose " andrew davenport , wellinborough i am sick to death of hearing highly paid regulators telling the rest of us that clients should only pay fees to advisers and that we should scrap commission .
it is ok for them because they can afford to pay fees .
the vast majority of people in this country prefer to pay by commission because finding an upfront fee is difficult for many of them .
people should have the right to choose .
we should also stop calling it " commission " because at the end of the day it is a fee for work carried out , not some sort of windfall bonus payment to the adviser .
andrew davenport , wellinborough i have knowingly consulted a financial adviser only once .
i wanted advice about how best to manage my money .
she advised me to purchase critical illness cover and was paid commission .
i am fairly sure i do not need this policy .
prior to this , i was mis-sold an endowment by somebody i thought was representing my mortgage provider , but it turned out , 15 years on , to have been an ifa .
later i was mis-sold a pension .
i do n't wish to be sold any so-called financial " product " but i want impartial expert advice about how to get out of the difficulties i am in .
i would be prepared to pay for this .
commission simply makes ifas need to sell instead of advise .
barbara mcneill , sheffield ifas have a legal obligation to disclose the amount they are earning in actual monetary terms .
we discuss this issue quite clearly with every client .
the fsa is inferring that " fees " are good whilst " commission " is bad .
commission , if disclosed properly , is a perfectly acceptable method of payment and one which many of our clients choose .
the fsa lives in world far removed from reality and thinks that if commission was banned then bad advice would be a thing of the past .
how refreshing it would be if john howard spent as much energy on promoting the positive side of good professional financial advice instead of pursuing fanciful , and out-of-touch ideas .
david winter , fareham , hants " the murky commissions system on financial products creates a major conflict of interest " jack mcvey , uddingston i totally agree that the murky commissions system on financial products creates a major conflict of interest for the ifa which disadvantages the public .
i have been looking into pension income withdrawal products and am amazed at the attitude of ifas who believe that they and their 3 % initial charge are the only route to an income withdrawal arrangement .
sadly they are almost correct .
this monopoly needs to be brought to an end .
jack mcvey , uddingston sadly mis-selling does exist and no amount of regulation will stop it .
it is down to the individual to give professional , unbiased advice .
if you remove commission and go totally fee-based then you will have some clients paying a small fee for advice and others , in effect being ripped off .
how much research is an advisor going to do if the fee only represents an hour 's work ?
mortgages are well regulated but poor advice still exists , many people are purchasing products and paying over the odds because their advisor does not use the whole market place .
then you have secured loans , people consolidating their credit cards and securing it on their homes , and this is not regulated !
where there is money to earn there will be those looking to take advantage .
david fairey , herts " to improve this situation the government would be wise to take steps at educating the public in financial matters " louis d 'espagnac , new milton the best solution would be for ifas to charge a fee in the manner john howard described it , however the general public overall does not want to pay fees for proper independent advice .
this in my opinion derives from a lack of financial education .
too often financial matters are seen as boring or are addressed too late .
in my opinion to improve this situation the government would be wise to take steps at educating the public in financial matters .
i find programmes like money box very good indeed at informing / educating the public .
on the other hand i do not rate financial advice in this country .
however , there are an increasing number of ifas who do put the welfare of their clients first .
louis d 'espagnac , new milton i can not understand the hypothesis that consumers do not benefit from the " choice " of how to pay for financial advice .
removing the option for the product provider to subsidise the advice process for the client by paying a commission will surely reduce access to high quality financial advice for a large number of people .
it is further my understanding that the majority of mis-selling was attributable to the product provider and bank tied agents who , under these proposals , will be the only avenue available for many consumers .
it seems totally counter-intuitive .
neil stevens , chester " wealthy clients can afford fees but joe public ca n't " ian southgate , westcliff-on-sea ifa for 33 years .
never sold a contract unless i would have bought it myself in the client 's circumstances .
wealthy clients can afford fees but joe public ca n't and they are the people that need the advice the most .
the public needs the choice .
ifas not to be trusted ?
maybe a few years ago but not anymore .
no , i 'm fed up with all the bad publicity .
what about the fsa making our job easier by introducing an understandable " risk-rating " matrix to guide the public rather than waiting for problems to occur then hanging the ifas out to dry .
ian southgate , westcliff-on-sea i am a whole-of-market mortgage adviser who gives advice and recommendation .
by financial authority rules the product i select for each customer has to be the cheapest possible .
each lender pays me a commission for recommending their products when the mortgage completes .
i also charge an administration fee .
commission varies from lender to lender but i have to prove in every case that the cheapest product available been selected .
if commission is no longer paid then customers who do n't want to pay or ca n't afford broker fees will go direct to lenders .
individual lenders usually only have a limited range of products , they also usually only provide an information-only service .
i believe that this would see a far greater number of consumers ending up with the wrong product than the current system .
robert , manchester " if commission ends so will independent advice " jon baxter , stanmore people think that anyone in the insurance world should work for nothing .
only the upper end will pay a fee .
if we can not charge a fee , then we have to have a commission-based product .
if commission ends so will independent advice .
i never look at the commission amount before selecting a product .
jon baxter , stanmore a lot of people simply can not afford to pay for advice by way of an upfront fee and advice should not just be for the wealthy .
also the commission is confirmed in writing and there is always the option to ask to pay by fee for those who can afford it .
ian thorneycroft , stoke we were mis-sold an endowment in the 80s .
i am convinced that had the sales person not been paid on commission , the chances of us being mis-sold would have been reduced .
what we really need is absolute transparency .
at the point when products are recommended , advisers should be legally obliged to show customers , in writing , what their commission will be .
other potential solutions can be tricky .
companies understand that the alternative - making customers pay for advice up-front - can have an adverse effect on sales .
so only a rule which forces this on all players in the market would work .
larry jay , kent " the industry needs to protect people against this kind of practice " reg proudfoot , kent i am totally disillusioned by ifas .
i am 74 and my thinking is slow .
i wanted to have the option to pay for financial advice but was lost when it came to making the purchase .
it was only after when the recommended package was purchased that i discovered two issues that i had been " saddled " with , they were : i had been charged £ 1,700 for the purchase of £ 50,000 of investment .
the company that my ifa had selected , i later found out in a sunday newspaper , was giving a 40 % inducement to the ifa for the purchase of buying its policy .
the industry needs to protect people against this kind of practice when people who are ignorant in this field .
reg proudfoot , kent the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

commission varies from lender to lender but i have to prove in every case that the cheapest product available been selected .
if commission is no longer paid then customers who do n't want to pay or ca n't afford broker fees will go direct to lenders .

john howard , chairman of the financial services consumer panel says mis-selling scandals can be traced back to commission .
and he says consumer confidence in financial services would be restored if commission was ended .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
people should have the right to choose andrew davenport , wellinborough i am sick to death of hearing highly paid regulators telling the rest of us that clients should only pay fees to advisers and that we should scrap commission .
it is ok for them because they can afford to pay fees .
the vast majority of people in this country prefer to pay by commission because finding an upfront fee is difficult for many of them .
people should have the right to choose .
we should also stop calling it " commission " because at the end of the day it is a fee for work carried out , not some sort of windfall bonus payment to the adviser .
andrew davenport , wellinborough i have knowingly consulted a financial adviser only once .
i wanted advice about how best to manage my money .
she advised me to purchase critical illness cover and was paid commission .
i am fairly sure i do not need this policy .
prior to this , i was mis-sold an endowment by somebody i thought was representing my mortgage provider , but it turned out , 15 years on , to have been an ifa .
later i was mis-sold a pension .
i do n't wish to be sold any so-called financial " product " but i want impartial expert advice about how to get out of the difficulties i am in .
i would be prepared to pay for this .
commission simply makes ifas need to sell instead of advise .
barbara mcneill , sheffield ifas have a legal obligation to disclose the amount they are earning in actual monetary terms .
we discuss this issue quite clearly with every client .
the fsa is inferring that " fees " are good whilst " commission " is bad .
commission , if disclosed properly , is a perfectly acceptable method of payment and one which many of our clients choose .
the fsa lives in world far removed from reality and thinks that if commission was banned then bad advice would be a thing of the past .
how refreshing it would be if john howard spent as much energy on promoting the positive side of good professional financial advice instead of pursuing fanciful , and out-of-touch ideas .
david winter , fareham , hants the murky commissions system on financial products creates a major conflict of interest jack mcvey , uddingston i totally agree that the murky commissions system on financial products creates a major conflict of interest for the ifa which disadvantages the public .
i have been looking into pension income withdrawal products and am amazed at the attitude of ifas who believe that they and their 3 % initial charge are the only route to an income withdrawal arrangement .
sadly they are almost correct .
this monopoly needs to be brought to an end .
jack mcvey , uddingston sadly mis-selling does exist and no amount of regulation will stop it .
it is down to the individual to give professional , unbiased advice .
if you remove commission and go totally fee-based then you will have some clients paying a small fee for advice and others , in effect being ripped off .
how much research is an advisor going to do if the fee only represents an hour 's work ?
mortgages are well regulated but poor advice still exists , many people are purchasing products and paying over the odds because their advisor does not use the whole market place .
then you have secured loans , people consolidating their credit cards and securing it on their homes , and this is not regulated !
where there is money to earn there will be those looking to take advantage .
david fairey , herts to improve this situation the government would be wise to take steps at educating the public in financial matters louis d 'espagnac , new milton the best solution would be for ifas to charge a fee in the manner john howard described it , however the general public overall does not want to pay fees for proper independent advice .
this in my opinion derives from a lack of financial education .
too often financial matters are seen as boring or are addressed too late .
in my opinion to improve this situation the government would be wise to take steps at educating the public in financial matters .
i find programmes like money box very good indeed at informing / educating the public .
on the other hand i do not rate financial advice in this country .
however , there are an increasing number of ifas who do put the welfare of their clients first .
louis d 'espagnac , new milton i can not understand the hypothesis that consumers do not benefit from the " choice " of how to pay for financial advice .
removing the option for the product provider to subsidise the advice process for the client by paying a commission will surely reduce access to high quality financial advice for a large number of people .
it is further my understanding that the majority of mis-selling was attributable to the product provider and bank tied agents who , under these proposals , will be the only avenue available for many consumers .
it seems totally counter-intuitive .
neil stevens , chester wealthy clients can afford fees but joe public ca n't ian southgate , westcliff-on-sea ifa for 33 years .
never sold a contract unless i would have bought it myself in the client 's circumstances .
wealthy clients can afford fees but joe public ca n't and they are the people that need the advice the most .
the public needs the choice .
ifas not to be trusted ?
maybe a few years ago but not anymore .
no , i 'm fed up with all the bad publicity .
what about the fsa making our job easier by introducing an understandable " risk-rating " matrix to guide the public rather than waiting for problems to occur then hanging the ifas out to dry .
ian southgate , westcliff-on-sea i am a whole-of-market mortgage adviser who gives advice and recommendation .
by financial authority rules the product i select for each customer has to be the cheapest possible .
each lender pays me a commission for recommending their products when the mortgage completes .
i also charge an administration fee .
commission varies from lender to lender but i have to prove in every case that the cheapest product available been selected .
if commission is no longer paid then customers who do n't want to pay or ca n't afford broker fees will go direct to lenders .
individual lenders usually only have a limited range of products , they also usually only provide an information-only service .
i believe that this would see a far greater number of consumers ending up with the wrong product than the current system .
