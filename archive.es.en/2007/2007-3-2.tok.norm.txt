the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .

piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .

" we will be on the streets as long as it takes and with as many men as it takes to keep the peace , " police spokesman flemming steen munch told afp , adding that police reinforcements had been called in from across the country . a group of 18 demonstrators entered the headquarters of the social democratic party on friday around midday , unfurling a banner reading : " you stole the youths ' building , now we 're taking yours " , but the situation remained calm , protestors said . demonstrators clash with police the group , calling itself the action group for frustrated copenhagen residents , demanded a political solution to the conflict which erupted when thousands of youths attacked police after a dawn raid to evict squatters from the ungdomshuset , a four-storey haven for rebels , punks and squatters in the norrebro district . the building has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the group permission to move into the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators on thursday activists threw stones , bottles , pots of paint , firecrackers , molotov cocktails , and set up barricades , lit fires and overturned vehicles to protest the eviction . riot police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the emonstrators , some of whom were masked . " we were surprised by the extent of the conflict and the demonstrators ' wild violence , " steen munch said .
the noerrebro neighborhood is home to a large population of young radicals and squatters and is the scene of regular flare-ups with police . in may 1993 , bloody clashes erupted following denmark 's " yes " vote to the maastricht treaty that led to the creation of the european union and the euro single currency . by late thursday the violence had spread out from noerrebro to the nearby district of christianshavn .
christianshavn is next to the so-called " free city " of christiania , an autonomous community in the city set up more than 30 years ago . " utterly reprehensible " danish politicians reacted with shock to the events .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen " vigorously condemned " thursday 's riots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen condemened the outbreak of violence " it is utterly reprehensible that a few trouble-makers continue to create disorder , " he told danish news agency ritzau . justice minister lene espersen told danish television channel tv2 she was shocked by protestors ' violence . " we have freedom of expression in denmark and it is shocking to see the use of violence and cobble stones to show what one thinks , " espersen said . the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the fundamental christian group fadershuset , which has demanded the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative crowd , offering concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . the ungdomshuset web site says the group is run along five simple guidelines : no sexism , no " heterosexism " - prejudice in favor of heterosexuals - no racism , no hard drugs and no violence . some onlookers at the scene on thursday were critical of the danish police action . one noerrebro resident described the operation as something resembling " the dismantling of a terrorist network . " kristina ilsoe , a roskilde university professor who watched the events with her three-year-old son at her side , said she was " sad , like most of the neighbors , to see so-called tolerant denmark not leave room for those who do n't fit the norm . " some banks and stores in the area barricaded their entrances to protect their businesses . foreigners arrested police meanwhile said they were re-establishing border controls o prevent an influx of supporters from other countries , in particular southern neighbor germany . among the 217 arrested on thursday were 17 foreigners from france , germany , norway , poland , lithuania , new zealand and the united states .
the german foreign ministry confirmed that nine germans were among those held .
three police officers and three demonstrators were injured during the clashes , police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police made a number of arrests in norrebro meanwhile , german police said on friday they had detained 16 people after demonstrations broke out in the cities of hamburg and hanover in solidarity with the squatters evicted in denmark . on friday the majority of danish politicians , with the exception of the extreme-left , hailed the police action and denounced the activists ' violence . the press meanwhile unanimously condemned the " street wars " and " chaos . " according to the danish foreign ministry , demonstrations supporting the activists were held in front of denmark 's diplomatic missions in stockholm , oslo , berlin , hamburg , hanover , flensburg and vienna . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels soccer schedule in saxony in response to riots all lower-league soccer matches in the eastern state of saxony this weekend have been cancelled in response to the violence at last weekend 's match in leipzig , the german soccer federation announced wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .
but airbus has suffered repeated delays on the project and earlier this week said it was suspending work on the cargo version due to order cancellations . the us freight and messenger service fedex scrapped its order for 10 a380f cargo planes in november after airbus announced a two-year delay in deliveries .

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .

" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .
but airbus has suffered repeated delays on the project and earlier this week said it was suspending work on the cargo version due to order cancellations . the us freight and messenger service fedex scrapped its order for 10 a380f cargo planes in november after airbus announced a two-year delay in deliveries .

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries .

" body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot !

through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto .

" klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot !

and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .

no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .
-lrb- 11.07.2006 -rrb- germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .
god knows , they 've had experience enough with setbacks .

to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 02.03.2007 nice guys need not finish last großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mid-season acquisitions like striker mohamed zidan have mainz celebrating nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .
god knows , they 've had experience enough with setbacks .

but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun .

" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said .

homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .

he had 110 grams of the radioactive nuclear fuel , in the form of 14 pellets .
they were buried in a steel container in the man ’ s back garden . the pellets were designed to act as fuel rods for nuclear reactors , but how they ended up in a 45 year old man ’ s back garden remains a mystery . authorities remain baffled as to how the man got hold of the radioactive element uranium , and managed to apparently keep it undetected for 15 years .
all this despite him first telling local police he had it in his possession over 10 years ago . possessing nuclear fuel is a criminal offence in germany , but authorities say they see no need to imprison or charge the man before they have completed their enquiries . letter of admission sent to merkel herself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her staff did n't take the letter seriously jutta kremer-heye , spokeswoman for lower saxony ’ s ministry for the environment , admits that having uranium in one 's personal possession is an unusual offence .
" something like that is simply not allowed , " she said .
" then again the man did turn himself in .
with the help of his lawyer he wrote a letter to chancellor merkel and then that letter came to us in lower saxony . " kremer-heye adds that the letter arrived at the chancellor ’ s office over a month ago , but action was only taken last week .
the letter was forwarded from department to department .
so why the delay ? " we first checked the letter , because it was somewhat implausible , " kremer-heye added .
" it said he had had the pellets for 16 years , and had taken the police to where he thought the pellets were in 1994 , but they found nothing . " so we had to check whether what he said was believable .
then a week ago we sent our radiation team out , and with the help of the man they actually did find this steel container buried in the ground with the pellets inside . " enclosed with the letter was a diagram of the box he kept the pellets in , and kremer-heye says this drawing was convincing enough to warrant closer investigation . hardly weapons-grade material ... but still ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : send for elbaradei : the un may want to check out this house the pellets were not a particularly dangerous .
uranium must be enriched to a minimum of 60 percent to be useful as a weapon - whereas these pellets were only enriched to 4 percent , making them hazardous to human health only after prolonged contact or ingestion . they are also hard to detect because the radiation levels are so low .
this may help explain why the pellets weren ’ t found the first time the man tried to confess . it wasn ’ t only in 1994 that the man tried to tell his bizarre story .
local papers report that he even turned up at the offices of the influential german weekly der spiegel with the radioactive pellets on his person , but he simply wasn ’ t taken seriously . the pellets are now to be examined in karlsruhe , with the major questions being where they came from and how old they actually are . the riddle of what drove the man to get the pellets , bury them in his garden for years , and then admit what he did to the german chancellor herself , could prove even harder to solve . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "

"
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .

prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .

0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

" she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .

" other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

" the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 02.03.2007 germany to withdraw troops from bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers may soon be leaving bosnia according to media reports , germany will withdraw some of its around 850 troops from bosnia and herzegovina in the wake of a decision by britain to do the same . citing an unnamed european diplomat , business daily financial times on friday said germany was to pull its troops out of bosnia after the european union said it was scaling down peacekeepers from 6,500 to around 2,500 in the balkan nation . " the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.03.2007 italy 's prodi wins second confidence vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's win spells an end to italy 's political crisis italy 's centre-left government easily won a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament friday , formally ending a political crisis sparked by last week 's resignation of prime minister romano prodi . the centre-left prevailed in the chamber of deputies by 342 to 253 , with two abstentions by far-left members .
the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .

he had 110 grams of the radioactive nuclear fuel , in the form of 14 pellets .
they were buried in a steel container in the man ’ s back garden . the pellets were designed to act as fuel rods for nuclear reactors , but how they ended up in a 45 year old man ’ s back garden remains a mystery . authorities remain baffled as to how the man got hold of the radioactive element uranium , and managed to apparently keep it undetected for 15 years .
all this despite him first telling local police he had it in his possession over 10 years ago . possessing nuclear fuel is a criminal offence in germany , but authorities say they see no need to imprison or charge the man before they have completed their enquiries . letter of admission sent to merkel herself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her staff did n't take the letter seriously jutta kremer-heye , spokeswoman for lower saxony ’ s ministry for the environment , admits that having uranium in one 's personal possession is an unusual offence .
" something like that is simply not allowed , " she said .
" then again the man did turn himself in .
with the help of his lawyer he wrote a letter to chancellor merkel and then that letter came to us in lower saxony . " kremer-heye adds that the letter arrived at the chancellor ’ s office over a month ago , but action was only taken last week .
the letter was forwarded from department to department .
so why the delay ? " we first checked the letter , because it was somewhat implausible , " kremer-heye added .
" it said he had had the pellets for 16 years , and had taken the police to where he thought the pellets were in 1994 , but they found nothing . " so we had to check whether what he said was believable .
then a week ago we sent our radiation team out , and with the help of the man they actually did find this steel container buried in the ground with the pellets inside . " enclosed with the letter was a diagram of the box he kept the pellets in , and kremer-heye says this drawing was convincing enough to warrant closer investigation . hardly weapons-grade material ... but still ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : send for elbaradei : the un may want to check out this house the pellets were not a particularly dangerous .
uranium must be enriched to a minimum of 60 percent to be useful as a weapon - whereas these pellets were only enriched to 4 percent , making them hazardous to human health only after prolonged contact or ingestion . they are also hard to detect because the radiation levels are so low .
this may help explain why the pellets weren ’ t found the first time the man tried to confess . it wasn ’ t only in 1994 that the man tried to tell his bizarre story .
local papers report that he even turned up at the offices of the influential german weekly der spiegel with the radioactive pellets on his person , but he simply wasn ’ t taken seriously . the pellets are now to be examined in karlsruhe , with the major questions being where they came from and how old they actually are . the riddle of what drove the man to get the pellets , bury them in his garden for years , and then admit what he did to the german chancellor herself , could prove even harder to solve . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 02.03.2007 nice guys need not finish last großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mid-season acquisitions like striker mohamed zidan have mainz celebrating nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .
god knows , they 've had experience enough with setbacks .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .
just do n't overdo the sightseeing , says faith dennis .
-lrb- 23.02.2007 -rrb- i ’ m not wearing prada , but that ’ s ok faith got a once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend a berlinale premier - in her gym clothes .
-lrb- 16.02.2007 -rrb- from arden pennell in berlin rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "

" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money .

" the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context .

were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .

in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

" we will be on the streets as long as it takes and with as many men as it takes to keep the peace , " police spokesman flemming steen munch told afp , adding that police reinforcements had been called in from across the country . a group of 18 demonstrators entered the headquarters of the social democratic party on friday around midday , unfurling a banner reading : " you stole the youths ' building , now we 're taking yours " , but the situation remained calm , protestors said . demonstrators clash with police the group , calling itself the action group for frustrated copenhagen residents , demanded a political solution to the conflict which erupted when thousands of youths attacked police after a dawn raid to evict squatters from the ungdomshuset , a four-storey haven for rebels , punks and squatters in the norrebro district . the building has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the group permission to move into the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators on thursday activists threw stones , bottles , pots of paint , firecrackers , molotov cocktails , and set up barricades , lit fires and overturned vehicles to protest the eviction . riot police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the emonstrators , some of whom were masked . " we were surprised by the extent of the conflict and the demonstrators ' wild violence , " steen munch said .
the noerrebro neighborhood is home to a large population of young radicals and squatters and is the scene of regular flare-ups with police . in may 1993 , bloody clashes erupted following denmark 's " yes " vote to the maastricht treaty that led to the creation of the european union and the euro single currency . by late thursday the violence had spread out from noerrebro to the nearby district of christianshavn .
christianshavn is next to the so-called " free city " of christiania , an autonomous community in the city set up more than 30 years ago . " utterly reprehensible " danish politicians reacted with shock to the events .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen " vigorously condemned " thursday 's riots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen condemened the outbreak of violence " it is utterly reprehensible that a few trouble-makers continue to create disorder , " he told danish news agency ritzau . justice minister lene espersen told danish television channel tv2 she was shocked by protestors ' violence . " we have freedom of expression in denmark and it is shocking to see the use of violence and cobble stones to show what one thinks , " espersen said . the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the fundamental christian group fadershuset , which has demanded the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative crowd , offering concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . the ungdomshuset web site says the group is run along five simple guidelines : no sexism , no " heterosexism " - prejudice in favor of heterosexuals - no racism , no hard drugs and no violence . some onlookers at the scene on thursday were critical of the danish police action . one noerrebro resident described the operation as something resembling " the dismantling of a terrorist network . " kristina ilsoe , a roskilde university professor who watched the events with her three-year-old son at her side , said she was " sad , like most of the neighbors , to see so-called tolerant denmark not leave room for those who do n't fit the norm . " some banks and stores in the area barricaded their entrances to protect their businesses . foreigners arrested police meanwhile said they were re-establishing border controls o prevent an influx of supporters from other countries , in particular southern neighbor germany . among the 217 arrested on thursday were 17 foreigners from france , germany , norway , poland , lithuania , new zealand and the united states .
the german foreign ministry confirmed that nine germans were among those held .
three police officers and three demonstrators were injured during the clashes , police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police made a number of arrests in norrebro meanwhile , german police said on friday they had detained 16 people after demonstrations broke out in the cities of hamburg and hanover in solidarity with the squatters evicted in denmark . on friday the majority of danish politicians , with the exception of the extreme-left , hailed the police action and denounced the activists ' violence . the press meanwhile unanimously condemned the " street wars " and " chaos .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .
just do n't overdo the sightseeing , says faith dennis .

" we will be on the streets as long as it takes and with as many men as it takes to keep the peace , " police spokesman flemming steen munch told afp , adding that police reinforcements had been called in from across the country . a group of 18 demonstrators entered the headquarters of the social democratic party on friday around midday , unfurling a banner reading : " you stole the youths ' building , now we 're taking yours " , but the situation remained calm , protestors said . demonstrators clash with police the group , calling itself the action group for frustrated copenhagen residents , demanded a political solution to the conflict which erupted when thousands of youths attacked police after a dawn raid to evict squatters from the ungdomshuset , a four-storey haven for rebels , punks and squatters in the norrebro district . the building has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the group permission to move into the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators on thursday activists threw stones , bottles , pots of paint , firecrackers , molotov cocktails , and set up barricades , lit fires and overturned vehicles to protest the eviction . riot police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the emonstrators , some of whom were masked . " we were surprised by the extent of the conflict and the demonstrators ' wild violence , " steen munch said .
the noerrebro neighborhood is home to a large population of young radicals and squatters and is the scene of regular flare-ups with police . in may 1993 , bloody clashes erupted following denmark 's " yes " vote to the maastricht treaty that led to the creation of the european union and the euro single currency . by late thursday the violence had spread out from noerrebro to the nearby district of christianshavn .
christianshavn is next to the so-called " free city " of christiania , an autonomous community in the city set up more than 30 years ago . " utterly reprehensible " danish politicians reacted with shock to the events .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen " vigorously condemned " thursday 's riots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen condemened the outbreak of violence " it is utterly reprehensible that a few trouble-makers continue to create disorder , " he told danish news agency ritzau . justice minister lene espersen told danish television channel tv2 she was shocked by protestors ' violence . " we have freedom of expression in denmark and it is shocking to see the use of violence and cobble stones to show what one thinks , " espersen said . the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the fundamental christian group fadershuset , which has demanded the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative crowd , offering concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . the ungdomshuset web site says the group is run along five simple guidelines : no sexism , no " heterosexism " - prejudice in favor of heterosexuals - no racism , no hard drugs and no violence . some onlookers at the scene on thursday were critical of the danish police action . one noerrebro resident described the operation as something resembling " the dismantling of a terrorist network . " kristina ilsoe , a roskilde university professor who watched the events with her three-year-old son at her side , said she was " sad , like most of the neighbors , to see so-called tolerant denmark not leave room for those who do n't fit the norm . " some banks and stores in the area barricaded their entrances to protect their businesses . foreigners arrested police meanwhile said they were re-establishing border controls o prevent an influx of supporters from other countries , in particular southern neighbor germany . among the 217 arrested on thursday were 17 foreigners from france , germany , norway , poland , lithuania , new zealand and the united states .
the german foreign ministry confirmed that nine germans were among those held .
three police officers and three demonstrators were injured during the clashes , police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police made a number of arrests in norrebro meanwhile , german police said on friday they had detained 16 people after demonstrations broke out in the cities of hamburg and hanover in solidarity with the squatters evicted in denmark . on friday the majority of danish politicians , with the exception of the extreme-left , hailed the police action and denounced the activists ' violence . the press meanwhile unanimously condemned the " street wars " and " chaos . " according to the danish foreign ministry , demonstrations supporting the activists were held in front of denmark 's diplomatic missions in stockholm , oslo , berlin , hamburg , hanover , flensburg and vienna . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels soccer schedule in saxony in response to riots all lower-league soccer matches in the eastern state of saxony this weekend have been cancelled in response to the violence at last weekend 's match in leipzig , the german soccer federation announced wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot !

the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .

in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .
just do n't overdo the sightseeing , says faith dennis .
-lrb- 23.02.2007 -rrb- i ’ m not wearing prada , but that ’ s ok faith got a once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend a berlinale premier - in her gym clothes .
-lrb- 16.02.2007 -rrb- from arden pennell in berlin rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.03.2007 calls for debate over us plans for missile system on euro soil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radar stations and missiles could be stationed on european soil as part of the plan ukrainian prime minister victor yanukovich called friday for trilateral talks between the united states , the european union and russia on the stationing of parts of the us missile defense system in central europe . " european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's coalition has been divided over italy 's peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan the other , salvatore cannavo , said he abstained in solidarity with senator franco turigliatto , who was expelled from the refoundation communist party after voting against prodi last week .
shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .
the changes are blamed for prodi 's current shaky hold on the senate , while the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the 630-seat lower house is bolstered by a built-in majority prize of 30 seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prodi stays in power after italian senate confidence vote italian prime minister romano prodi survived a close vote of confidence in the senate on wednesday , putting an end to a weeklong political crisis that saw his resignation .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .

shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .
berlusconi , who had previously rejected any change to the law , back-pedaled on the issue ahead of friday 's vote , saying that he was " available for dialogue " on electoral reforms .
berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .
" poland the czech republic do not represent a threat to anybody , " said solana .
" we must do our utmost ... to have good , solid relations with russia , " he added . while it was " questionable " whether the eu faced any security threat today , the situation could change in the future , said solana .
he added , however , that the bloc was " not considering the establishment " of a similar anti-missile system . germans see possibility of a parallel eu system this contradicted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's own statements last month when he said europe was considering its own missile defence system but acknowledged that europe does not yet have the technological know-how to build a rival to the us system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung and frank-walter steinmeier " i think that a lot of countries are interested in these -lrb- defense -rrb- systems .
time will tell how many of these are effective , " steinmeier said .
" in europe , we are also thinking about the creation of such systems and of their deployment .
but for the moment we are not very far advanced in terms of the technology . " german defence minister franz josef jung told reporters last week that the us plan to establish a radar station in the czech republic and an underground missile silo in poland did not pose a security threat to russia .
jung also said the us plan should be discussed within nato . obering explained that the european part of the system will see 10 interceptor missiles set up in poland in an area the size of a soccer field , at a total cost of up to $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . the radar system in the czech republic - to be moved there from its current base in the south pacific region - would cost some 500 million dollars . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

he had 110 grams of the radioactive nuclear fuel , in the form of 14 pellets .
they were buried in a steel container in the man ’ s back garden . the pellets were designed to act as fuel rods for nuclear reactors , but how they ended up in a 45 year old man ’ s back garden remains a mystery . authorities remain baffled as to how the man got hold of the radioactive element uranium , and managed to apparently keep it undetected for 15 years .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .
but airbus has suffered repeated delays on the project and earlier this week said it was suspending work on the cargo version due to order cancellations . the us freight and messenger service fedex scrapped its order for 10 a380f cargo planes in november after airbus announced a two-year delay in deliveries .
international lease finance corp.

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun . " klopp has , in fact , been much more intense on the sidelines in 2007 , and his fraternal relationship with his players , especially the zidan , has paid dividends . a little help from their friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streak began with a tough 1-0 win over bochum in january having finally achieved promotion three seasons ago after decades in the second division , mainz ' merry band of carnevalesque underdogs and their supporters quickly won fans throughout germany . despite their impressive streak , mainz have n't wowed anyone in 2007 with classy combinations .
but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg . " rosy prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz have scured zidan 's services until 2010 with 27 points and 10th place in the table , mainz have positioned themselves well for the home stretch of the season .
and in zidan , andreasen and soto , they 've added a trio for the future as well . mainz have n't yet completely pulled themselves out of the danger zone , but followers of the club are optimistic about the next three months . " after the first half of the season , i thought they 'd definitely go down , " said hessel .
" but not any more .
they have huge amounts of self-confidence so i think they can weather the inevitable rough spells .
god knows , they 've had experience enough with setbacks .

" we will be on the streets as long as it takes and with as many men as it takes to keep the peace , " police spokesman flemming steen munch told afp , adding that police reinforcements had been called in from across the country . a group of 18 demonstrators entered the headquarters of the social democratic party on friday around midday , unfurling a banner reading : " you stole the youths ' building , now we 're taking yours " , but the situation remained calm , protestors said . demonstrators clash with police the group , calling itself the action group for frustrated copenhagen residents , demanded a political solution to the conflict which erupted when thousands of youths attacked police after a dawn raid to evict squatters from the ungdomshuset , a four-storey haven for rebels , punks and squatters in the norrebro district . the building has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the group permission to move into the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators on thursday activists threw stones , bottles , pots of paint , firecrackers , molotov cocktails , and set up barricades , lit fires and overturned vehicles to protest the eviction . riot police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the emonstrators , some of whom were masked . " we were surprised by the extent of the conflict and the demonstrators ' wild violence , " steen munch said .
the noerrebro neighborhood is home to a large population of young radicals and squatters and is the scene of regular flare-ups with police . in may 1993 , bloody clashes erupted following denmark 's " yes " vote to the maastricht treaty that led to the creation of the european union and the euro single currency . by late thursday the violence had spread out from noerrebro to the nearby district of christianshavn .
christianshavn is next to the so-called " free city " of christiania , an autonomous community in the city set up more than 30 years ago . " utterly reprehensible " danish politicians reacted with shock to the events .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen " vigorously condemned " thursday 's riots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen condemened the outbreak of violence " it is utterly reprehensible that a few trouble-makers continue to create disorder , " he told danish news agency ritzau . justice minister lene espersen told danish television channel tv2 she was shocked by protestors ' violence . " we have freedom of expression in denmark and it is shocking to see the use of violence and cobble stones to show what one thinks , " espersen said . the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the fundamental christian group fadershuset , which has demanded the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative crowd , offering concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . the ungdomshuset web site says the group is run along five simple guidelines : no sexism , no " heterosexism " - prejudice in favor of heterosexuals - no racism , no hard drugs and no violence . some onlookers at the scene on thursday were critical of the danish police action . one noerrebro resident described the operation as something resembling " the dismantling of a terrorist network . " kristina ilsoe , a roskilde university professor who watched the events with her three-year-old son at her side , said she was " sad , like most of the neighbors , to see so-called tolerant denmark not leave room for those who do n't fit the norm . " some banks and stores in the area barricaded their entrances to protect their businesses . foreigners arrested police meanwhile said they were re-establishing border controls o prevent an influx of supporters from other countries , in particular southern neighbor germany . among the 217 arrested on thursday were 17 foreigners from france , germany , norway , poland , lithuania , new zealand and the united states .
the german foreign ministry confirmed that nine germans were among those held .
three police officers and three demonstrators were injured during the clashes , police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police made a number of arrests in norrebro meanwhile , german police said on friday they had detained 16 people after demonstrations broke out in the cities of hamburg and hanover in solidarity with the squatters evicted in denmark . on friday the majority of danish politicians , with the exception of the extreme-left , hailed the police action and denounced the activists ' violence . the press meanwhile unanimously condemned the " street wars " and " chaos . " according to the danish foreign ministry , demonstrations supporting the activists were held in front of denmark 's diplomatic missions in stockholm , oslo , berlin , hamburg , hanover , flensburg and vienna . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels soccer schedule in saxony in response to riots all lower-league soccer matches in the eastern state of saxony this weekend have been cancelled in response to the violence at last weekend 's match in leipzig , the german soccer federation announced wednesday .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .
but airbus has suffered repeated delays on the project and earlier this week said it was suspending work on the cargo version due to order cancellations . the us freight and messenger service fedex scrapped its order for 10 a380f cargo planes in november after airbus announced a two-year delay in deliveries .

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

" we will be on the streets as long as it takes and with as many men as it takes to keep the peace , " police spokesman flemming steen munch told afp , adding that police reinforcements had been called in from across the country . a group of 18 demonstrators entered the headquarters of the social democratic party on friday around midday , unfurling a banner reading : " you stole the youths ' building , now we 're taking yours " , but the situation remained calm , protestors said . demonstrators clash with police the group , calling itself the action group for frustrated copenhagen residents , demanded a political solution to the conflict which erupted when thousands of youths attacked police after a dawn raid to evict squatters from the ungdomshuset , a four-storey haven for rebels , punks and squatters in the norrebro district . the building has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the group permission to move into the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators on thursday activists threw stones , bottles , pots of paint , firecrackers , molotov cocktails , and set up barricades , lit fires and overturned vehicles to protest the eviction . riot police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the emonstrators , some of whom were masked . " we were surprised by the extent of the conflict and the demonstrators ' wild violence , " steen munch said .
the noerrebro neighborhood is home to a large population of young radicals and squatters and is the scene of regular flare-ups with police . in may 1993 , bloody clashes erupted following denmark 's " yes " vote to the maastricht treaty that led to the creation of the european union and the euro single currency . by late thursday the violence had spread out from noerrebro to the nearby district of christianshavn .
christianshavn is next to the so-called " free city " of christiania , an autonomous community in the city set up more than 30 years ago . " utterly reprehensible " danish politicians reacted with shock to the events .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen " vigorously condemned " thursday 's riots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen condemened the outbreak of violence " it is utterly reprehensible that a few trouble-makers continue to create disorder , " he told danish news agency ritzau . justice minister lene espersen told danish television channel tv2 she was shocked by protestors ' violence . " we have freedom of expression in denmark and it is shocking to see the use of violence and cobble stones to show what one thinks , " espersen said . the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the fundamental christian group fadershuset , which has demanded the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative crowd , offering concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . the ungdomshuset web site says the group is run along five simple guidelines : no sexism , no " heterosexism " - prejudice in favor of heterosexuals - no racism , no hard drugs and no violence . some onlookers at the scene on thursday were critical of the danish police action . one noerrebro resident described the operation as something resembling " the dismantling of a terrorist network . " kristina ilsoe , a roskilde university professor who watched the events with her three-year-old son at her side , said she was " sad , like most of the neighbors , to see so-called tolerant denmark not leave room for those who do n't fit the norm . " some banks and stores in the area barricaded their entrances to protect their businesses . foreigners arrested police meanwhile said they were re-establishing border controls o prevent an influx of supporters from other countries , in particular southern neighbor germany . among the 217 arrested on thursday were 17 foreigners from france , germany , norway , poland , lithuania , new zealand and the united states .
the german foreign ministry confirmed that nine germans were among those held .
three police officers and three demonstrators were injured during the clashes , police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police made a number of arrests in norrebro meanwhile , german police said on friday they had detained 16 people after demonstrations broke out in the cities of hamburg and hanover in solidarity with the squatters evicted in denmark . on friday the majority of danish politicians , with the exception of the extreme-left , hailed the police action and denounced the activists ' violence . the press meanwhile unanimously condemned the " street wars " and " chaos . " according to the danish foreign ministry , demonstrations supporting the activists were held in front of denmark 's diplomatic missions in stockholm , oslo , berlin , hamburg , hanover , flensburg and vienna . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels soccer schedule in saxony in response to riots all lower-league soccer matches in the eastern state of saxony this weekend have been cancelled in response to the violence at last weekend 's match in leipzig , the german soccer federation announced wednesday .

ups originally expected its first freighter in 2009 . ups said it had intended to complete an internal study of whether it could wait until 2012 for the aircraft , " but now understands airbus is diverting employees from the a380 freighter program to work on the passenger version of the plane , " a company statement said . " based on our previous discussions , we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when airbus could supply this plane , " said david abney , ups ' chief operating officer and president of ups airline . " we no longer are confident that airbus can adhere to that schedule .
ups has built one of the largest airlines in the world in order to ensure reliable service to our customers , and we 're confident we have the resources to continue doing so in the future . " on february 5 , ups announced a multibillion-dollar order for 27 boeing 767 freighter planes , and said the a380 order was subject to an " ongoing review . " deliveries of ups ' a380s were originally scheduled to begin in 2009 and run through 2012 .
but airbus has suffered repeated delays on the project and earlier this week said it was suspending work on the cargo version due to order cancellations . the us freight and messenger service fedex scrapped its order for 10 a380f cargo planes in november after airbus announced a two-year delay in deliveries .

airbus is to cut 4,300 jobs in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain over the next four years . deliveries of the passenger version of the giant plane are now two years behind schedule , putting a severe strain on airbus ' finances and damaging the company 's reputation among clients and investors . airbus is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits . under the major reorganization announced on wednesday , airbus is to sell off several factories and make greater use of sub-contractors . the moves have sparked calls for strikes and prompted political leaders in europe to question the structure of airbus ' parent , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers pledge fight against airbus cuts german workers at european jet maker airbus said thursday they felt cheated by plans to slash jobs under a drastic restructuring bid , while officials touted their success in limiting the damage .

" the decisions for force transition are still in progress , " the eu diplomat was quoted by the financial times .
" but the germans are on the way out , " he said . the newspaper did not indicate how many of the troops would be withdrawn .
and berlin is yet to make a formal statement regarding its plans in bosnia . the report of possible german withdrawal came only one day after british armed forces minister adam ingram announced to the lower house of commons that britain would withdraw almost all of its 600 troops from the country . improved security meanwhile , eu defense ministers , who started a two-day informal meeting in wiesbaden on thursday brought forward a move to cut eu troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . extended mandate the international community , however , is still concerned about the developments in the former yugoslav republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schwarz-schilling will stay in bosnia longer than planned earlier this week , the steering board of the international peace implementation council -lrb- pic -rrb- decided in brussels that the office of the high representative and special eu representative - an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord in bosnia and herzegovina - " will remain in place and continue to carry out its mandate under the dayton peace agreement , " for another year . that means that germany 's christian schwarz-schilling , who took over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown in january will stay in office until at least june , 30 2008 . that extension of schwarz-schilling 's mandate represented a u-turn by the pic , which guides the 1995 dayton peace process , as last year it had announced the post would be scrapped in june 2007 , and the entire running of the country handed over to local politicians . but a slowing up of the reform process and a failure to adopt agreed constitutional amendments has led the international community to think again . outstanding concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers helped with the destruction of weapons collected throughout bosnia the eu commission has stressed the need to address the outstanding concerns before progress can be made by bosnia and herzegovina towards a stability and association agreement with the european union , a necessary precursor to eventual membership . those requirements include the reform of the police force , currently split between the two entities which make up bosnia and herzegovina , the -lrb- serb -rrb- republika srpska and the muslim-croat federation . bosnia is also expected to cooperate fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to secure the arrests of war crimes suspects involved in the country 's 1992-95 war , which claimed more than 200,000 lives . german presence in bosnia 850 german soldiers , who are currently stationed in bosnia , are serving as part of the eu force -lrb- eufor -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that the bundeswehr is overstretched the eu launched a military operation in bosnia and herzegovina in december 2004 following the decision by nato to end its peacekeeping mission in the country after nine years .
code-named althea , the mission has seen 7,000 troops deployed under eu command in a bid to ensure continuous stability in a country devastated by war . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military has been called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone . wherever mainz end up in the standings at the end of this season , they 'll have made history .
never before has a team finished the first half of a bundesliga campaign in last place , with a mere 11points , and then won five of their next six games . unbelievable as it may sound , the 2006 cellar dwellers were the bundesliga 's best team in the first third of the season 's second half .
given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .

andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .

" the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .

but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents .

given a snowball 's chance in hell in december , the team went on an undefeated roll in january and february . how did they do it ?
a number of factors have played a part in mainz 's recovery : precisely chosen additions to the squad , faith in a popular coach and perhaps some good will from their opponents . bremen castaways come up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing columbian national elkin soto was one of three wise winter moves during the winter break , the mainz management realized its 2006 squad was n't up to the job and brought in striker mohamed zidan and midfielders leon andreasen and elkin soto . " they targeted very specific needs , and they 've strengthened the squad ideally , " said roland hessel , a sports editor who follows the team for the regional allgemeine zeitung newspaper . striker zidan - who spent last season with mainz out on loan from werder bremen - proved well worth the 2.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- transfer fee mainz paid to acquire him permanently .
with six goals in five games , he revived mainz 's moribund attack . the other new acquisitions have panned out as well . " leon andreasen has assumed a special role as team leader , " said hessel .
" he 's helped the other players forget the first half of the season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mainz back four no longer looks horrific with andreasen and soto in the squad , mainz tightened up its midfield , and that has improved a defense that led the league in goals allowed in december . there are some clouds on the horizon .
andreasen will sit out mainz 's match against aachen on sunday after picking up a red card , and soto is out approximately four weeks with injury .
but bremen , who only have 7 points to mainz 's 16 in 2007 , still probably regret letting zidan and andreasen go . continuity with klopp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jürgen klopp 's attention is back on his charges in mainz in the first half of the season , coach jürgen klopp came in for some unaccustomed criticism , with detractors saying he was being distracted by his side job as a commentator for german national team matches . but unlike mönchengladbach , hamburg and bayern , mainz decided to stick with their coach , who 's known for his adolescent enthusiasm for the game and his motivational skills . " the key was that mainz is the sort of club that was prepared to go down with klopp , " said hessel .
" that 's why he was allowed to stay . " for klopp , the first half of the season was a learning process , " hessel continued .
" he knows now that soccer is n't just about having fun .

but perhaps the club 's general popularity has had an unconscious effect on opponents , who have often seemed content to watch mainz stumble to unlikely victories . case in point : mainz ' 2-1 upset of hertha in berlin in game 22 .
klopp 's troops played like total klutzes during the first half , before a wrongly awarded penalty and an out-of-the-blue strike secured them a win against their strangely passive opponents . " it 's not so bad losing to mainz , " one hertha fan remarked after watching the match in a bar , " if it improves their chances of staying up . " maybe , in their heart of hearts , mainz 's opponents do n't really hate dropping points to a side that has brought such likeable fire to the weekly routine of the bundesliga . hessel concurred : " the other teams would rather visit a club like mainz next year than a club like wolfsburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .
several far-left lawmakers have already said they will oppose refinancing of the afghan mission in a vote looming later this month .
prodi may have to accept the embarrassment of finding the necessary numbers in the opposition camp .
berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .
in january italy , which is the un security council non-permanent member in charge of afghan issues , said it would be hosting a donor 's conference later in the year .
0ne of the two lawmakers who abstained from the vote on friday was daniele capezzone of the small left-wing rose in the fist party , who has criticised prodi 's 12-point pact as too weak and inadequate .

shaky support from communists proved prodi 's undoing during his first stint as prime minister in 1996-98 . the crisis has been bruising for prodi , but it has also pointed up disarray in the centre-right , which did not respond with a united front .
piero fassino , national secretary of the democrats of the left , taunted berlusconi on the floor of the chamber of deputies on friday , saying , " the truth ... is that a large part of your coalition distrusts your leadership . "
he noted that none of the main leaders in the centre-right coalition presented the same proposals when consulted by president giorgio napolitano last week .
electoral reforms needed the crisis also shone the spotlight on italy 's need for far-reaching electoral reforms to make the country more governable , a project that prodi has named as a top priority .

berlusconi - who enjoys the distinction of having been the only italian prime minister to serve a full five years in office , from 2001 to 2006 - pushed through a new electoral law just weeks before last april 's elections narrowly won by the prodi coalition .

berlusconi on friday reaffirmed support for the afghan mission and ridiculed prodi 's remark following wednesday 's vote that the centre-left was " self-sufficient . "
speaking on the afghan issue on friday , prodi said support was building " day by day " for an international conference on afghanistan demanded by the communists and greens in his coalition .

the result was expected given the centre-left 's comfortable majority in the lower house , but leaves the coalition with little room to manoeuvre in the senate , where it enjoys a mere two-seat advantage .
speaking to the chamber of deputies before the vote , prodi said a full five-year mandate would be necessary " to heal , to set in motion appropriate remedies and to obtain results . "
berlusconi slams prodi government prodi resigned abruptly last wednesday after two communist senators in his coalition torpedoed a vote of confidence in his foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former italian prime minister berlusconi has lost no time in capitalizing on the government 's disarray centre-right opposition leader and arch-rival silvio berlusconi , taking the floor ahead of the vote friday , said the resignation had caused " humiliating damage to our country . "
he heaped scorn on prodi 's nine-party coalition - stretching from hardline communists and greens to centrist catholics - saying it had become " an untidy and quarrelsome condominium association . "
to bring into line his disparate coalition , prodi , 67 and serving his second stint as prime minister , had them sign a 12-point " non-negotiable " agreement . disagreement on afghanistan deployment heading the list was respect for italy 's international commitments , notably to maintain its 1,800-strong peacekeeping contingent in afghanistan .

homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

local papers report that he even turned up at the offices of the influential german weekly der spiegel with the radioactive pellets on his person , but he simply wasn ’ t taken seriously . the pellets are now to be examined in karlsruhe , with the major questions being where they came from and how old they actually are . the riddle of what drove the man to get the pellets , bury them in his garden for years , and then admit what he did to the german chancellor herself , could prove even harder to solve . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

and don ’ t get me wrong , it ’ s not because i think i am above it - far from it .
but having spent a large part of my life moving countries every few years i have become extremely materialistically streamlined , dust-gathering knick-knacks not featuring heavily on my packing lists .
especially as i am usually limited by the excess luggage allowance on the infamous orange airline , which at five euros a kilo , generally makes you leave the kitchen sink behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't hear reggae at just any flea market however , despite my reliance on the above mentioned mode of transport , i am quite ecologically aware , and becoming increasingly economically aware , so this week i thought it was about time i hit the german flea markets to see what recycled bargains there might be on offer . dance club turned midnight market flea markets are an integral part of german culture , a far cry from the english car boot sale , which generally consists of a myriad of stalls offering plastic star wars figures , broken toasters and a million lighters for a pound .
often located in a multi-storey car park , unless you are a hardcore bargain hunter , these aren ’ t generally the nicest places to spend your precious sunday morning . i didn ’ t have to worry about losing a lie-in for my first german flea-market , however , as it started at 8 pm and took place in a local nightclub in kreuzberg , better known for thrashing heavy metal concerts than nachtflohmärkte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you might have to search for hours to find a few good german classics at a flea market despite the lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke and old beer , the transformation from club to marketplace was remarkable .
rows of tables lined the dance floor , covered in the obligatory other people ’ s old stuff : clothes , books , dvd ’ s and an assortment of -lrb- possibly broken -rrb- electrical equipment .
the stage had tables and chairs set up on it , where people sat around chatting , discussing their purchases over a beer or three from the bar , whilst the dj booth was occupied by a smiley man playing reggae music . strange visit from dr. hartz about half way through the evening , a man in a white coat introduced himself on stage as doctor hartz , offering free advice and a sprechstunde to those affected by the hartz iv reforms currently changing the welfare system here in germany .
a bizarre , but somehow befitting touch . i ’ m not sure whether it was the reggae -lrb- shopping malls should really cotton onto that and ditch the muzak -rrb- , or the bottle of berliner pilsner , but my friend and i had a great time sifting through other peoples ’ old stuff and found some real gems in the piles .
a few one euro dvds and some equally inexpensive classic german novels later , i left a converted bargain hunter . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns falafels at three am are the secret to a happy guest entertaining guests in berlin is a easy as pie - or maybe as bratwurst and beer .

" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2007 controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research - hyped as a " cure-all " the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom . in a controversial twist to the international ' stem cell wars ' , women in britain can now donate their freshly harvested eggs to science , theoretically helping to further advances in techniques such as therapeutic cloning and stem cell research . but what makes the decision unusual is that although they would not be paid for this " altruistic donation , " they would be eligible for expenses of up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 490 -rrb- - a development which has prompted experts to question not so much whether women should be free to donate , but whether scientists should be allowed to ask . boosting science the ground-breaking announcement came from britain 's human fertilization and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which said the move could help stem cell researchers find a cure for heart problems , infertility , diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's - and stressed that the ' fee ' was not a payment , but compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists argue red tape is putting the brakes on science " the authority has decided that women will be allowed to donate their eggs to research , in conjunction with their own ivf treatment or as an altruistic donor , " said angela mcnab , chief executive of the hfea .
" given that the medical risks for donating for research are no higher than for treatment , we have concluded that it is not for us to remove a woman 's choice of how her donated eggs should be used . " the decision was welcomed in britain , a world leader in stem cell research , where scientists have complained that a shortage of eggs and excessive red tape are hampering progress . " women are capable of making their own minds up about whether or not they donate their eggs for research .
society should respect their autonomy , " said alison murdoch , director of the newcastle fertility center at life , which was awarded britain 's first license to begin recruiting women donors who are not already having medical treatment . " body-shopping " and exploitation but elsewhere , the scheme has come in for manifold criticism , with many arguing that it renders women mere receptacles and paves the way for a growing commercialization of the human body . donna dickenson one of britain 's leading experts on medical ethics , stresses a subsequent need for a set of legal protections for women who donate eggs . " some women do donate altruistically , and that 's an important right , " she says on her website .
" but just because someone has made a ' free ' choice to engage in any activity does n't mean the law has nothing to say about it .
we need strict regulation to protect them , if we decide to allow them to donate .
and the same is true of everyone who may be affected by ' body shopping ' - by the growing commercialization of human tissue . " " -lrb- the decision -rrb- is highly problematic , " agrees member of the european parliament hiltrud breyer from the german green party .
" my fear is that it will open up an ethical floodgate , which will erode the basic principle of the non-commercialization of the human body .
women will be reduced to the status of mere suppliers of raw materials . " an object of trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egg donation : not as easy as giving blood in germany , where the production of human embryonic stem cells is prohibited by the embryo protection law , bio-ethics experts are worried that the hfea 's decision will result in hard-up women taking part simply for the money , ignoring any potential risks . " the idea that women can make up their own minds about donating shows a striking ignorance of social realities , " says breyer .
" we already know there is a flourishing egg trade with eastern europe , where many women would see 370 euros as a lot of money . " dirk lanzerath , ceo of the german reference center for ethics in the life sciences -lrb- drze -rrb- , echoes her fears . " the example of the black market organ trade shows us that financial motivation tends to open up markets , especially in developing countries . " the issue occupies a legal gray area , he points out , citing the convention on human rights and biomedicine , on transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin , which states that " advertising the need for , or availability of , organs or tissues , with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable advantage , shall be prohibited . " health risks but it is the physical risks which concern sigrid graumann , a former member of the german parliament 's enquete commission ethics and law in modern medicine .
in the field of reproductive medicine , she says , women 's welfare should always take first priority - and the process of egg donation involves women taking hormones which can cause complications such as ovarian hyper stimulation , future fertility problems and even kidney failure and death . " if women undergo this treatment only in order to donate , the risks can not even be justified as in their own interests , " she points out . # b # dirk lanzerath is equally skeptical .
" the procedure is in no way comparable to giving blood or donating sperm , " he says , " because it entails serious risks which are not acceptable in a non-therapeutic context . " mep peter liese from germany 's christian democrats is convinced the uk model might even prove counter-productive by providing grist to the mill of opponents of stem cell research .
" generally , opinion is starkly divided on the issue of embryo protection between the conservative christian position and the ' liberal ' position , " he says .
" but there is a broad consensus that we need to be very careful with egg donation .
were wide-scale therapeutic cloning to occur , hundreds of thousands of women a year would have to be donating eggs at considerable risk .
this alone is a valid argument for a restrictive approach to stem cell research . "
" it is outrageous of the hfea to suggest that the scientific benefits outweigh the risks of paid egg donation , " concurrs hiltrud breyer .
" science simply does not have the right to gamble with women 's health in the name of this supposed cure-all , especially when its alleged benefits for mankind are based on utterly exaggerated and unrealistic promises .

" european security should not be divided in a way that benefits certain countries only , such as poland and the czech republic , " yanukovich told the german newspaper die welt in an interview . trilateral talks would ensure the planned interceptor missiles and their accompanying tracking stations did not pose any dangers , said the prime minister , who enjoys the open support of russian president vladimir putin . " if we 're talking about a global security system , ukraine can also make a contribution .
to date we 've been treated as though we do not exist , " yanukovich told die welt . the us plans to extend its missile defence system into europe have been met with hostility by russia which has taken exception to the idea of building a radar system in the caucasus region . the " forward deployable radar " would provide an " early acquisition track " on any hostile missile for a bigger radar system based in the czech republic , us air force lieutenant general henry obering , the head of the us missile agency , said this week . " it 's transportable radar , it 's something that you can set up in a matter of days , very , very fast .
we have time to work out where that location could be , " he told reporters at nato headquarters in brussels . proposed caucasus site raises russian concerns when asked which country in the volatile caucasus region might be willing to host the site , he said : " i am not at liberty to talk about that in any length ... suffice to say that we would like to place a radar in that region . " obering , who met with russian officials in brussels during two days of talks this week , played down any potential risk this mobile radar could pose to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus base would be set up to stop iranian missiles " that radar would be oriented into iran .
we ca n't turn it around to look into russia , and even if we can , it ca n't see far enough to be able to establish a track on a russian missile , " he said . the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations with poland and the czech republic to install radar and 10 missile interceptors , prompting strong objections from neighbouring russia and an outcry in europe . washington maintains that the system would help protect its european allies and is only meant to be used against " rogue threats " from countries like iran or north korea . obering was unable to say what was really behind russia 's hostility , which he said had surprised the united states .
" i do n't want to guess , but there 's something else , obviously , there must be something else they are concerned about .
but i frankly do n't believe that it is a concern about changing the strategic balance between the united states and russia , " he said . " these are not offensive missiles , they are defensive missiles and they do not have warheads . " he said that russia would be welcome to inspect the european sites , if the czech republic and poland agree .
" if it 's ok with those nations , it 's ok with us , " he said . eu nations free to choose , says solana european union defence chiefs sought to ease russian concerns over the us plans and said the 27-nation bloc wanted " solid " relations with moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana wants russia to be kept within the fold eu foreign policy chief javier solana , attending a meeting of the bloc 's defence ministers in the german city of wiesbaden this week , said every eu country was free to decide whether or not to accept the us system . solana reiterated the us pledge that the defense system was just that - a defense system and that if the missiles were placed on european soil , there would be no threat .

germany has promoted the idea , but poland and the netherlands are skeptical . at the meeting in heidelberg , german minister of education and research annette schavan said " education is one of europe 's most important resources for power and prosperity . " she also said that education is essential for shaping identity and for social cohesion in europe .
the minister called on her colleagues in eu nations and neighboring countries to stress the shared values and cultural perspectives among europeans . one way of highlighting common european culture would be the creation of a pan-european history book for pupils . a franco-german school history book was already launched last year - a project which schavan said had been a success and could be a model for a european version . in the baby stages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who learn together , grow together schavan first raised the issue of a common european history book last month and said that discussions about it had only just begun . " we 've heard lots of positive reactions from eu member states in the past few days , " schavan said . swiss author adolf muschg told the gathering in heidelberg that such a project was " a fantastic idea " but that it needed time to develop . yet schavan also noted that the netherlands and poland in particular have been skeptical of the idea .
" some people in the country have criticized the notion , " she said . " we do n't believe this is possible , " said polish minister of education roman giertych , who suggested a joint polish-german history book instead . german minister schavan , however , said that many polish historians were enthused about public discussions about european history . furthermore , one delegation at the meeting pointed to the success of a recently published book about serbian and croatian history , which both countries want to introduce in school lessons . the heidelberg meeting took place within the framework of germany 's presidency of the european union .
in addition to the bloc 's 27 members , ministers from 10 neighboring states took part . protestors : " equal education for all " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education and research annette schavan in addition to the formal items on the agenda , leo-felix lee of the german ministry for education said " informal talks are also possible to address topics that are sometimes left by the wayside , but which are still important to eu member states . " other issues discussed at the talks were adult education and pre-school education . not everyone in heidelberg was happy , though .
a group of around 200 demonstrating students , pupils , union members and anti-globalization activists gathered in the small university town to demand equal education opportunities for everyone . one of the mottos of the protestors was : " education is a human right , " while another group demanded that the education ministers stop the " growing trend toward privatization " among schools and universities in the eu . also during the discussions in heidelberg , polish minister of education and vice- prime minister giertych sparked critique from his colleagues about his comments on homosexuality and abortion .
homosexuality is " a deviation from the laws of nature , " he said . the minister also demanded a ban on abortion .
" this crime , which many countries ' parliaments have legalized , is a modern form of barbarianism , " he said . " the comments caused an uproar , " said doris pack , chairperson of the european parliament 's committee on culture and education . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

picturing 9/11 dw-world : the " zen " of berlin : concentration and culture-shock dw-world : the suffering of “ others ” dw-world : memory , one piece at a time student correspondents -pipe- 02.03.2007 rational disdain for distant relatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criticism does n't necessarily exclude understanding americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it . walking down friedrichstrasse the other day , i saw a poster proclaiming , “ bush isn ’ t an american !
he ’ s an idiot ! ” “ gee , thanks , ” i thought , for implying that the two concepts are mutually exclusive .
many people throughout the world have become more inclined to see “ american ” and “ idiot ” as intimately linked .
the british tabloid daily mirror famously asked in a front-page headline on november 4 , 2004 : “ how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? ” of course , the friedrichstrasse sign also implied that those who chose bush were idiots , but the basic notion of divorcing a hated leader from a larger population is common here in germany .
perhaps this is based on their particular history and its larger-than-life villain , but regardless of the reason , it is a fairness i have come to highly appreciate . the even-handed , rational german approach to forming political opinion certainly doesn ’ t mean that people are uncritical . there is hefty , biting criticism of america here . but it is measured , justified , and rarely leveled in the mainstream press for aesthetic trendiness or out of the sort of emotional infancy on hand at the daily mirror . not so different after all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bush is n't an american , he 's an idiot ! "
the mirror ’ s emotional outburst irks because it makes americans “ the other , ” when in reality the relationship between the united states and europe is much closer than mirror editors may be comfortable admitting . as historians from eric foner to reinhold wagnleitner have pointed out , america is none other than a continuation of post-enlightenment european trends of individual freedom , capitalistic enterprise , etc. left to ripen in modernity without the tempering and derailing influence of continually destructive domestic wars . supported by copious alexis de tocqueville quotes , commentators from all spectrums also like to point out how little the american character has changed in the last two hundred years , becoming merely an enhanced caricature of itself .
in other words , we remain the transplanted europeans we once were . crass american commercialism the european creation of america was quite clear to me this weekend in hamburg , where i learned about local shipping company hapag ’ s advertisements for the land of freedom and opportunity .
through trained representatives , the corporation spread glorious images to the poorer farming areas of southern germany as well as to eastern europe so that emigrants would decide to make the trip on their ships . if that ’ s not crass “ american ” commercialism , i don ’ t know what is .
and we mustn ’ t forget that colonially ambitious british monarchs actively worked to convince their subjects that a fresh , young land lay open for exploitation just across the atlantic .
no wonder americans feel so entitled to rule the world - they were promised it long ago , when they were still europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " always ready to counter the aggression of the us " i had a very european moment of not understanding the us the other day when i wondered aloud how bush found so much support from middle america in the last election -lrb- i , too am susceptible to mirror- like astonishment at times -rrb- . a friend from the midwest responded by explaining that kerry embodied the arrogance of coastal people like me , a born-and-raised new yorker , and that it was difficult for people to vote for someone who condescended to them .
in order to help me understand this mindset , he entreated me to remember moments when europeans acted as though they were more “ civilized ” than americans . even if i agreed with some of what jacques chirac said , my friend asked , would i vote for him for president ? a circle of condescension but if europeans are busy disapproving of america , and coastal americans are busy disapproving of central ones , who are those “ heartland ” inhabitants looking down on ? those who look down on them , of course - and this is the mirror image of european resentment of american cultural hegemony , the resentment of a perceived encroachment of values . it might not sell ship tickets , but disdain and resentment are common factors on both sides of the atlantic .
thank goodness , however , that knee-jerk anti-americanism - so trendy in other regions - barely has a toehold in mainstream german society .
i get to enjoy living in a place where the resentment and disdain are backed up by carefully-weighed arguments . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier columns dw-world : two ’ s company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

but he said he was " very unhappy " that the process to charge 31-year-old david hicks had taken so long .
a us military judge finally charged mr hicks on thursday with " providing material support for terrorism " .
there has been growing domestic unease over mr hicks ' treatment , and mr howard had been under pressure to intervene .
mr hicks was detained in afghanistan , where he allegedly fought alongside the ruling taleban against us-led forces .
he has been at guantanamo since january 2002 , a month after his capture .
details emerged on friday of claims that mr hicks has been abused during his time in the detention camp .
in documents due to be presented in may to a british court , as part of his application for uk citizenship , mr hicks said he had been shown a photo of a battered fellow inmate , and was told he would be subject to similar treatment if he did not co-operate .
in the documents , obtained by australian media , mr hicks said the anxiety caused by months of abuse had forced him to " say anything " to military interrogators .
' enemy combatant ' mr hicks is set to be the first suspect tried under a new us law authorising special military trials of " enemy combatants " , passed by congress last year .
the us military claims mr hicks supported terrorism by attending al-qaeda training courses , and conducted surveillance on the us embassy in kabul .
his american lawyer , maj michael mori , said the charge of material support for terrorism brought against his client was fabricated .
he wants the australian government to mount a formal challenge against the charge , claiming it has no legal foundation .
with the trial due to start before july , terry hicks - david hicks ' father - said the timetable was being dictated by politics - a deal between the bush administration and the howard government to get his son back to australia before federal elections due later this year .
both mr hicks ' lawyers and family have been pushing for a resolution to the situation for a long time , saying they feared for his mental health after such a long period in detention without trial .
the australian public , too , has been increasingly angry about the length of time he has been in detention .
mr howard made a direct demand for a quick resolution of the case to us vice president dick cheney , when he visited sydney last weekend .
" the americans have certainly speeded up the process , whether that is the result of representations i 've made to both president bush and vice president cheney i do n't know , " mr howard told australian media on friday .
" we remain unhappy that it has taken so long , " he said .
" i ca n't defend the length of time it 's taken . "
mr howard is also under pressure for not doing enough to try to have mr hicks repatriated to face trail in australa , as fellow us ally britain has done .
but the australian leader told reporters on friday : " i thought , on balance , justice was better served by an improved military commission in the united states . " .
mr mori said mr hicks had " no hope of facing a fair trial , which would have been provided to an american a long time ago . "
a preliminary hearing for mr hicks is expected to be held within 30 days , and a jury trial will start within 120 days , in accordance with the military commissions act of 2006 .
the bush administration has said that mr hicks can serve his sentence in australia if convicted .

sales of the drinks - including tyskie and zywiec - helped the firm raise pre-tax profits by 20 % to £ 32.9m in the six months to 28 january .
the 662-pub chain said that food , including drinks bought with a meal , now made up about 50 % of sales .
it is selling about 450,000 coffees and 240,000 breakfasts each week , the company added .
total sales in the period were up 8 % to £ 438.4m.
but it warned that higher wages and utility costs , as well as tougher comparisons , meant like-for-like sales were set to slow from the 7.4 % seen in the first half to between 2 % and 4 % .
success company spokesman eddie gerhson said that the company had started stocking polish beers three years ago in pubs where small polish communities were living .
" we got in first and it has grown from there , " he said .
" there are now hundreds of thousands of polish people in the uk , which does n't do the sales any harm at all .
" there are also a lot of people who like to try different beers , be they brewed in poland , lithuania or jamaica . "
wetherspoon said another success had been a swedish brand of cider , kopparberg .
it said that it now sold more of the brand than anywhere else in the world - including in sweden .
the chain also said its 61 smoke-free pubs outside scotland - which had initially seen a " substantial decline " in sales and profits - were continuing to be " encouraging " in their performance .
a ban on smoking in public places in england comes into place this summer .

like-for-like sales at its mecca bingo clubs in scotland had fallen 15 % since smoking was banned in public places .
overall pre-tax profit at the group fell to £ 44.4m in 2006 , down 13.7 % from £ 50.5m a year earlier .

analysis by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news the downing street website crashes under the weight of e-mails from angry voters .
former cabinet ministers alan milburn and charles clarke - not men previously associated with the cutting edge of technology - make a big splash at westminster with the launch of a website .
a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups . "
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like " tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .
as successive british style governments do n't listen to , or abide by , the wishes of the people , how can we call the uk a democracy .
we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .
you would be amazed how many tony blair from downing street had signed the last petition i saw !
robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .
only a certain slice of the demographic ever spend time spouting their opinion on the internet , and e-petitions are very open to ' viral ' abuse. ed , london david j , david l and j smith all sound like they work for the government .
desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .
whilst some anoraks may have signed the petition more than once , the vast majority of british people have more integrity than that .
i have over a dozen email addresses put i chose to sign the petition just once .
david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .
it provides a refreshing platform for free speech and unlimited possibilities in networking with other like-minded people - a marvellous antidote to a reactionary mainstream media that sides with the powerful and scapegoats the powerless .
the powers-that-be would love nothing more than to curb our use of the ' world wide web ' and indeed we have already seen clamp-downs occurring .
but we justice-seeking net-surfers remain ever-vigilant to this !
athena murphy , london , england ah , but the fact that david actually bothered to vote at all goes to show the strength of feeling .
if it was all such a joke then why bother to vote even once , let alone multiple times ?
paul , aldershot i love the way that people are talking about the pointlessness of e-forums on one .
surely that 's ironic ?
h , uk while it is true that an individual could sign an e-petition several times , the fact that there is a balancing " pro road pricing " petition with a tiny fraction of the support the " anti " petition recieved still shows the strength of feeling .
when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .
chandra , london just imagine how many people would have signed an anti-war petition in early 2003 , if approximately 1.8 million people physically made their way to london and marched about the issue .
upwards of 30 million ?
yet do we really think such a petition would have changed anything ?
with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?
i visited the 2020 vision site and saw a number of comments in their " have your say " section , prominently from major labour politicians , welcoming " this debate " .
i could n't find the link on the site to the debate itself .
douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .
what with libraries being shut due to a decrease in demand , cost etc ... and lots of places stereotyping that everyone has a computer with the internet , these locations are often difficult to get to .
where i live , only recently an internet " cafe " has closed , with another one seemingly hidden on a back street , and with a library that most people probably do n't even know exists which has only 1 computer available within it even if they do , sometimes even if you want to get involved you often can not .
but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .
hitler frequently used referendums too , do n't forget ...
andrew whiteside , london just because people watch videos on youtube and other websites -lrb- that may or may not have a political agenda -rrb- does not mean that they are influenced by them of even agree with them .

clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups .
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .
as successive british style governments do n't listen to , or abide by , the wishes of the people , how can we call the uk a democracy .
we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .
you would be amazed how many tony blair from downing street had signed the last petition i saw !
robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .
only a certain slice of the demographic ever spend time spouting their opinion on the internet , and e-petitions are very open to ' viral ' abuse. ed , london david j , david l and j smith all sound like they work for the government .
desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .
whilst some anoraks may have signed the petition more than once , the vast majority of british people have more integrity than that .
i have over a dozen email addresses put i chose to sign the petition just once .
david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .
it provides a refreshing platform for free speech and unlimited possibilities in networking with other like-minded people - a marvellous antidote to a reactionary mainstream media that sides with the powerful and scapegoats the powerless .
the powers-that-be would love nothing more than to curb our use of the ' world wide web ' and indeed we have already seen clamp-downs occurring .
but we justice-seeking net-surfers remain ever-vigilant to this !
athena murphy , london , england ah , but the fact that david actually bothered to vote at all goes to show the strength of feeling .
if it was all such a joke then why bother to vote even once , let alone multiple times ?
paul , aldershot i love the way that people are talking about the pointlessness of e-forums on one .
surely that 's ironic ?
h , uk while it is true that an individual could sign an e-petition several times , the fact that there is a balancing " pro road pricing " petition with a tiny fraction of the support the " anti " petition recieved still shows the strength of feeling .
when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .
chandra , london just imagine how many people would have signed an anti-war petition in early 2003 , if approximately 1.8 million people physically made their way to london and marched about the issue .
upwards of 30 million ?
yet do we really think such a petition would have changed anything ?
with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?
i visited the 2020 vision site and saw a number of comments in their " have your say " section , prominently from major labour politicians , welcoming " this debate " .
i could n't find the link on the site to the debate itself .
douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .
what with libraries being shut due to a decrease in demand , cost etc ... and lots of places stereotyping that everyone has a computer with the internet , these locations are often difficult to get to .
where i live , only recently an internet " cafe " has closed , with another one seemingly hidden on a back street , and with a library that most people probably do n't even know exists which has only 1 computer available within it even if they do , sometimes even if you want to get involved you often can not .
but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .
hitler frequently used referendums too , do n't forget ...
andrew whiteside , london just because people watch videos on youtube and other websites -lrb- that may or may not have a political agenda -rrb- does not mean that they are influenced by them of even agree with them .

analysis by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news the downing street website crashes under the weight of e-mails from angry voters .
a pro-american ad is making waves on you tube former cabinet ministers alan milburn and charles clarke - not men previously associated with the cutting edge of technology - make a big splash at westminster with the launch of a website .
a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
milburn and clarke are the latest converts to web politics the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
road pricing protesters crashed the downing street website but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .

a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
milburn and clarke are the latest converts to web politics the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
road pricing protesters crashed the downing street website but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups .
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .
as successive british style governments do n't listen to , or abide by , the wishes of the people , how can we call the uk a democracy .
we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .
you would be amazed how many tony blair from downing street had signed the last petition i saw !
robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .
only a certain slice of the demographic ever spend time spouting their opinion on the internet , and e-petitions are very open to ' viral ' abuse. ed , london david j , david l and j smith all sound like they work for the government .
desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .
whilst some anoraks may have signed the petition more than once , the vast majority of british people have more integrity than that .
i have over a dozen email addresses put i chose to sign the petition just once .
david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .
it provides a refreshing platform for free speech and unlimited possibilities in networking with other like-minded people - a marvellous antidote to a reactionary mainstream media that sides with the powerful and scapegoats the powerless .
the powers-that-be would love nothing more than to curb our use of the ' world wide web ' and indeed we have already seen clamp-downs occurring .
but we justice-seeking net-surfers remain ever-vigilant to this !
athena murphy , london , england ah , but the fact that david actually bothered to vote at all goes to show the strength of feeling .
if it was all such a joke then why bother to vote even once , let alone multiple times ?
paul , aldershot i love the way that people are talking about the pointlessness of e-forums on one .
surely that 's ironic ?
h , uk while it is true that an individual could sign an e-petition several times , the fact that there is a balancing " pro road pricing " petition with a tiny fraction of the support the " anti " petition recieved still shows the strength of feeling .
when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .
chandra , london just imagine how many people would have signed an anti-war petition in early 2003 , if approximately 1.8 million people physically made their way to london and marched about the issue .
upwards of 30 million ?
yet do we really think such a petition would have changed anything ?
with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?
i visited the 2020 vision site and saw a number of comments in their " have your say " section , prominently from major labour politicians , welcoming " this debate " .
i could n't find the link on the site to the debate itself .
douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .
what with libraries being shut due to a decrease in demand , cost etc ... and lots of places stereotyping that everyone has a computer with the internet , these locations are often difficult to get to .
where i live , only recently an internet " cafe " has closed , with another one seemingly hidden on a back street , and with a library that most people probably do n't even know exists which has only 1 computer available within it even if they do , sometimes even if you want to get involved you often can not .
but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .
hitler frequently used referendums too , do n't forget ...
andrew whiteside , london just because people watch videos on youtube and other websites -lrb- that may or may not have a political agenda -rrb- does not mean that they are influenced by them of even agree with them .

analysis by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news the downing street website crashes under the weight of e-mails from angry voters .
a pro-american ad is making waves on you tube former cabinet ministers alan milburn and charles clarke - not men previously associated with the cutting edge of technology - make a big splash at westminster with the launch of a website .
a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
milburn and clarke are the latest converts to web politics the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
road pricing protesters crashed the downing street website but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups .
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .
as successive british style governments do n't listen to , or abide by , the wishes of the people , how can we call the uk a democracy .
we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .
you would be amazed how many tony blair from downing street had signed the last petition i saw !
robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .
only a certain slice of the demographic ever spend time spouting their opinion on the internet , and e-petitions are very open to ' viral ' abuse. ed , london david j , david l and j smith all sound like they work for the government .
desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .
whilst some anoraks may have signed the petition more than once , the vast majority of british people have more integrity than that .
i have over a dozen email addresses put i chose to sign the petition just once .
david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .
it provides a refreshing platform for free speech and unlimited possibilities in networking with other like-minded people - a marvellous antidote to a reactionary mainstream media that sides with the powerful and scapegoats the powerless .
the powers-that-be would love nothing more than to curb our use of the ' world wide web ' and indeed we have already seen clamp-downs occurring .
but we justice-seeking net-surfers remain ever-vigilant to this !
athena murphy , london , england ah , but the fact that david actually bothered to vote at all goes to show the strength of feeling .
if it was all such a joke then why bother to vote even once , let alone multiple times ?
paul , aldershot i love the way that people are talking about the pointlessness of e-forums on one .
surely that 's ironic ?
h , uk while it is true that an individual could sign an e-petition several times , the fact that there is a balancing " pro road pricing " petition with a tiny fraction of the support the " anti " petition recieved still shows the strength of feeling .
when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .
chandra , london just imagine how many people would have signed an anti-war petition in early 2003 , if approximately 1.8 million people physically made their way to london and marched about the issue .
upwards of 30 million ?
yet do we really think such a petition would have changed anything ?
with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?
i visited the 2020 vision site and saw a number of comments in their " have your say " section , prominently from major labour politicians , welcoming " this debate " .
i could n't find the link on the site to the debate itself .
douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .
what with libraries being shut due to a decrease in demand , cost etc ... and lots of places stereotyping that everyone has a computer with the internet , these locations are often difficult to get to .
where i live , only recently an internet " cafe " has closed , with another one seemingly hidden on a back street , and with a library that most people probably do n't even know exists which has only 1 computer available within it even if they do , sometimes even if you want to get involved you often can not .
but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .
hitler frequently used referendums too , do n't forget ...
andrew whiteside , london just because people watch videos on youtube and other websites -lrb- that may or may not have a political agenda -rrb- does not mean that they are influenced by them of even agree with them .

when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .
chandra , london just imagine how many people would have signed an anti-war petition in early 2003 , if approximately 1.8 million people physically made their way to london and marched about the issue .
upwards of 30 million ?
yet do we really think such a petition would have changed anything ?
with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?
i visited the 2020 vision site and saw a number of comments in their " have your say " section , prominently from major labour politicians , welcoming " this debate " .
i could n't find the link on the site to the debate itself .
douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .
what with libraries being shut due to a decrease in demand , cost etc ... and lots of places stereotyping that everyone has a computer with the internet , these locations are often difficult to get to .
where i live , only recently an internet " cafe " has closed , with another one seemingly hidden on a back street , and with a library that most people probably do n't even know exists which has only 1 computer available within it even if they do , sometimes even if you want to get involved you often can not .
but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .

analysis by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news the downing street website crashes under the weight of e-mails from angry voters .
a pro-american ad is making waves on you tube former cabinet ministers alan milburn and charles clarke - not men previously associated with the cutting edge of technology - make a big splash at westminster with the launch of a website .
a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
milburn and clarke are the latest converts to web politics the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
road pricing protesters crashed the downing street website but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups .
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .
as successive british style governments do n't listen to , or abide by , the wishes of the people , how can we call the uk a democracy .
we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .
you would be amazed how many tony blair from downing street had signed the last petition i saw !
robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .
only a certain slice of the demographic ever spend time spouting their opinion on the internet , and e-petitions are very open to ' viral ' abuse. ed , london david j , david l and j smith all sound like they work for the government .
desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .
whilst some anoraks may have signed the petition more than once , the vast majority of british people have more integrity than that .
i have over a dozen email addresses put i chose to sign the petition just once .
david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .
it provides a refreshing platform for free speech and unlimited possibilities in networking with other like-minded people - a marvellous antidote to a reactionary mainstream media that sides with the powerful and scapegoats the powerless .
the powers-that-be would love nothing more than to curb our use of the ' world wide web ' and indeed we have already seen clamp-downs occurring .
but we justice-seeking net-surfers remain ever-vigilant to this !
athena murphy , london , england ah , but the fact that david actually bothered to vote at all goes to show the strength of feeling .
if it was all such a joke then why bother to vote even once , let alone multiple times ?
paul , aldershot i love the way that people are talking about the pointlessness of e-forums on one .
surely that 's ironic ?
h , uk while it is true that an individual could sign an e-petition several times , the fact that there is a balancing " pro road pricing " petition with a tiny fraction of the support the " anti " petition recieved still shows the strength of feeling .
when all three parties are in favour of a flawed concept , how else does the public make it 's wishes known ?
you ca n't vote against this in the next election can you ?
tony hart , guildford looking over your shoulder dead tree media ... ?
i 'm off to a bonfire with guido and the co-conspirators .
gareth dee , brighton it is incorrect to say that only a small number of people can use the internet .
free internet access in libraries and cheap internet cafes , where you get access for as little as £ 1 an hour , have made it available to anyone interested enough to try it out - and just like politics , there will always be a disinterested majority , but that 's life .

with so much evidence of " garbage out " in instances of managed political e-participation , why should people feel compelled to provide anything more than " garbage in " ?

douglas , glasgow although chandra is fairly correct , once you leave the big cities the availability of internet access in places like libraries and cafes all but disappear .

but as you say , ' that 's life ' .
emily , aberystwyth thank goodness that we have an elective democracy where we only decide our ruling party once every four or five years , and then leave lawmaking to professional politicians .
the prospect of an ignorant electronic mob making life-or-death decisions on what are effectively a series of endless referendums at the click of a mouse is terrifying .
hitler frequently used referendums too , do n't forget ...

analysis by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news the downing street website crashes under the weight of e-mails from angry voters .
a pro-american ad is making waves on you tube former cabinet ministers alan milburn and charles clarke - not men previously associated with the cutting edge of technology - make a big splash at westminster with the launch of a website .
a british-made film praising american foreign policy becomes a hit on you tube .
there have been more than a few false dawns since e-evangelists first predicted the internet would revolutionalise british politics .
but in the past few weeks a watershed moment may have been reached .
the net finally appears to be moving into the mainstream of british political life .
the question now is where does it go from here ?
and is it a good or bad thing for democracy ?
feeling the road pricing petition , which saw 1.8 million people e-mailing the downing street website , was arguably the biggest protest against government policy since 2003 's anti-war march .
but the jury is out on what it actually achieved and whether such petitions can truly be said to be democratic , given that many people still do not have access to a computer .
milburn and clarke are the latest converts to web politics the government is pushing ahead with road pricing pilot schemes , giving ammunition to those who say it was just the latest in a long line of cosmetic consultation exercises .
if nothing else , its supporters say , it made tony blair aware of the strength of feeling on the issue among a section of the electorate .
but although the government was portrayed as having been given a bloody nose by the protesters , it is ministers who may have the last laugh .
the e-mail addresses harvested by the petition are likely to prove a valuable resource for the government - even if downing street is only permitted to send one further e-mail to protesters , under data protection rules .
a judiciously timed message announcing a change of policy could work wonders on sceptical voters .
' virtual party ' the main political parties have all ramped up their spending on internet campaigning in recent months .
the conservatives , in particular , have spent heavily on their web presence , hiring ex-google staffer sam roake to come up with innovations such as webcameron , david cameron 's video blog .
the labour deputy leadership contest has also seen a flurry of web activity , with each of the six contenders using websites and blogs to build a support base .
but the only contender to emerge from the backbenches , john cruddas , is suspicious of the internet as a political tool .
rather than breathing much-needed new life into local party structures , he is concerned labour will use the net to create a " virtual party , " divorced from messy real-life diversions such as meetings and face-to-face debate .
he is not alone .
' opium ' on wednesday , charles clarke and alan milburn made history by launching what some cynics were describing as the first virtual party leadership bid .
the pair , long tipped as potential challengers to gordon brown , unveiled a website , the 2020 vision , which aims to provoke debate on future labour policy .
road pricing protesters crashed the downing street website but why launch a website , critics asked at the launch .
if they really wanted to provoke debate , why not simply launch a leadership bid ?
veteran labour mp austin mitchell - one of the first mps to write a blog - derided political websites as the new " opium of the masses " .
clarke and milburn are not ruling out leadership bids in the future and the site could be useful way of building support , but they both insisted their real intention was to open up the debate on important issues such as the environment and social mobility .
web forums mr clarke said he wanted it to be a wide-ranging " big tent " debate , rather than a narrowly focused attempt to construct an alternative manifesto , but , he added , he hoped it would not be too " woolly " and inconclusive .
mr milburn said he wanted the site to throw open the debate about labour 's future to the public at large .
they both pointed to the influence in us politics of web-based debates .
they said current debates - such as mr blair 's number 10 based policy review and the deputy leadership race - were too inward looking and did not address the wider country .
mr milburn 's argument was that people were far more engaged in politics than they were in the past .
they are no longer content to wait around for a general election every four or five years to have their say .
you only have to look at the growth in popularity of political blogs and discussion forums , many of them highly critical of the government , to see his point .
and it is a view gaining ground in government , which has made tentative efforts to open up the policy making process to the public through the internet .
video sharing web chats with ministers or officials formulating policy are still few and far between and those that have taken place have not attracted many hits , although this may be down to lack of publicity , according to a recent hansard society report .
but , their digital dialogues report adds , government departments are keen to continue with the experiment , seeing it as a way of broadening out the consultation process beyond professional lobbyists and the usual special interest groups .
it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like tim montgomerie , 18 doughty street on internet campaigning perhaps the most significant development in recent months has been the growth of video sharing .
politicians are starting to wake up to the potential of site such as you tube as a way of bypassing traditional media outlets , with their strict rules on impartiality and balance .
but others are also getting in on the act .
debate political web tv channel 18 doughty street has caused a bit of a stir with its latest video " a world without america , " which has attracted about 250,000 hits , with the vast bulk coming from you tube viewers .
tim montgomerie , one of the people behind 18 doughty street and the influential conservative home website , says it is the opening salvo in a campaign to combat what he sees as the growing tide of anti-american sentiment .
" it is much easier for british people to defend america , than for americans to defend america .
this is n't being funded by american business , it is not being funded by american tv networks , " he tells the bbc news website .
the ad , which takes is a satirical look at what life might be like if america had remained in political isolation , with spoof news bulletins announcing " margaret thatcher arriving at the world hunger summit in her state lada " and so on , has generated fierce , if incoherent , debate on you tube 's message board .
it was paid for by stephan shakespeare , a former adviser to lord archer , who was one of the founders of online polling company yougov .
' attack ads ' in the past , mr shakespeare might have put his money into a think tank in order to influence the political agenda , says mr montgomerie , but the internet is now the only game in town .
doughty street is quite open about its desire to bring us-style " attack " ads to the uk , via the internet .
it recently produced a scathing clip about london mayor ken livingstone .
but mr montgomerie insists it will generally steer clear of direct , personal attacks on individuals , of the type that have become so familiar during us elections , in favour of campaigns on political issues .
future campaigns include an attack on the ethics of the arms trade and the way the bbc is funded , apparently .
despite its close links to the conservative party - mr montgomerie was iain duncan smith 's chief of staff and was sent by the party to study web politics in the us - he insists 18 doughty street is home to a wide spectrum of views and its choice of campaigns is driven by its viewers .
as for the rise of e-democracy , he believes it has hardly started .
mr montgomerie said : " it is moving into the mainstream but i do n't think we have seen anything yet , as to what it is going to be like .
" we have n't had one really take off within britain , such as a personal , strong attack on gordon brown or david cameron .
we are not intending to go down that route . "
but others , he argues , just might , raising the prospect of the electoral commission or the government attempting to legislate political advertising on the web .
a quick glance at you tube shows that ukiphome have their own 17 doughty st films attacking david cameron .
while the tory leader 's webcameron films were also the subject of a much ridiculed spoof by labour mp sion simon .
and of course the george galloway backed ugly rumours band - featuring a tony blair lookalike - look set to see their net-based single war enter the charts at the weekend .
but even if the authorities tried to clamp down on web-based negative campaigns , sites such as 18 doughty street could simply move abroad , says mr montgomerie .
the genie , in other words , is out of the bottle .
the following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
whilst e-democracy seems attractive , the anti pay as you go road tax petition demonstrates a fundamental flaw .
voters are lazy .
it is almost impossible to get balanced discussions on web forums so voters tend to be swayed by peer based comments .
the media is expert at this but at least there is some form of restraint and comeback .
this is not so with the internet and public forums .
i am aware of individuals encouraged into signing the anti-pay as you go petition who upon reflection now regret attaching their signature .
e-democracy makes it too easy to respond and encourages poor decision making / voting .
david johnstone , aberdeenshire please stop peddling the nonsense that the road pricing petition was signed by 1.8 million people .
it was signed by 1.8 million email addresses .
most people have more that one email address and some isps give you an unlimited number .
i was able to sign one of the joke petitions on the 10 downing street web site multiple times under false names .
david l , reading , uk the problem with e-democracy is that it can easily be faked - 1.8m e-mail addresses , for example , represents nothing like 1.8m signatures .
i currently have active 4 email addresses for various purposes , and could set up several additional ones for free in minutes from hotmail or gmail - it would look like several people despite only being me .
john smith , somerset , uk the internet is awash with lies , deceit and conspiracy so seems like a fairly logical step for the politicians to get involved - what took them so long !
charles , london i used to think that democracy was essentially , government of the people , by the people and for the people .

we may as well be without a " government " tom leeds thomas lowry , leeds uk in response to the other views displayed so far that it is easy to fake an e-petition , it 's also easy to fake a written petition .

robert clayton , maidenhead the bbc continues to peddle a strong line that web politics , ' blogs ' , internet ranting make any difference to the real world .
in fact , this suggestion is always dismissed by real politicians and businessmen .
maybe this is linked to the decision to report less and less hard news in favour of the consensus opinions and speculation of more and more ' geeks ' , at the license payers expense , is related ?
what is always forgotten about is that most people in the uk are at best distrustful of the internet , if they even know about it .

desperately running off potential excuses to push ahead with this road pricing scheme despite its obvious unpopularity .
this is the true flaw in e-democracy as well as the normal kind ; unless it is near election time politicians do not give a damn what we say .
tony sweeting , leicester , uk just as cheaper printing in the 18th century spread the ideas of the enlightenment , so blogging is breaking down the cosy relationship between conventional media and the political classes .
it is born out of the abuse of this relationship that this government has done so much to discredit .

david w , london the internet has been used by political activists for some time now and this is nothing new .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- are we there yet -pipe- episode four : aviation bbc news / are we there yet graphics version bbc sport home friday , 2 march 2007 , 10:02 gmt episode four : aviation in the final episode of his personal journey around the uk transport system , john ware tackles the government 's mixed message about flying and the environment .
are we there yet ?
tuesday 27 march 2007 1930 gmt on bbc two when it comes to flying , ware says the maths do not appear to add up .
while the government is committed to reducing the uk 's total carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050 , it also forecasts air travel will , by then , have also nearly tripled .
aviation emissions are among the fastest growing greenhouse gases , yet the government is underwriting a huge expansion in air travel by allowing most uk airports to expand .
at the same time , ware points out , chancellor gordon brown has doubled airport duty to reduce the growth in flying and said " each country must take action domestically " to reduce aviation emissions .
but the prime minister 's message is that not flying away on holiday or on business is " just not practical . "
no wonder , ware argues , the house of commons transport select committee recently criticised the government for lacking a clear strategy for dealing with the only sector of the economy in which greenhouse gas emissions have risen consistently since 1990 .
how else can we cure our addiction for flying ?
ware explores france 's high speed railways and finds they are not the answer , then goes to southend which he says could provide it .

tuesday 27 march 2007 1930 gmt on bbc two when it comes to flying , ware says the maths do not appear to add up .
while the government is committed to reducing the uk 's total carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050 , it also forecasts air travel will , by then , have also nearly tripled .
aviation emissions are among the fastest growing greenhouse gases , yet the government is underwriting a huge expansion in air travel by allowing most uk airports to expand .
at the same time , ware points out , chancellor gordon brown has doubled airport duty to reduce the growth in flying and said " each country must take action domestically " to reduce aviation emissions .
but the prime minister 's message is that not flying away on holiday or on business is " just not practical . "
no wonder , ware argues , the house of commons transport select committee recently criticised the government for lacking a clear strategy for dealing with the only sector of the economy in which greenhouse gas emissions have risen consistently since 1990 .

assembly tory group leader nick bourne said £ 100 discounts would be given to every pensioner household in wales , at an estimated annual cost of £ 31m .
the announcement came ahead of the welsh party conference in cardiff .
mr bourne said his party would use this weekend 's conference to highlight the " positive difference " it could make .
the party 's council tax promise mirrors a one-off £ 100 payment made as a consequence of the 2005 assembly budget negotiations .
that money was paid to pensioners whose homes had increased by more than one band in the wales-wide revaluation process .
we are looking forward to a bright future for wales , not painting a dark , inaccurate picture of the past as labour has done nick bourne am , welsh conservative leader welsh conservatives have long criticised the way council bills have risen under labour .
' out of control ' labour regularly points out that it was conservative prime minister john major who introduced the property tax to replace the unpopular community charge , or poll tax , as it was widely known .
but the tories claim labour has allowed council tax bills to spiral out of control .
there is a precedent for cutting the tax for pensioners .
in 2005 budget negotiations in cardiff bay , the opposition parties won a concession that the tax bills would be cut by £ 100 in pensioner households where homes had risen by more than one council tax band due to revaluation .
mr bourne has promised to use the conference to highlight the positive difference his party could make to wales .
it follows last week 's welsh labour conference claims that voter apathy could lead to a tory-led " nightmare alliance " running the country .
he said : " welsh conservatives will fight the election on our strengths , our record , our policies and our vision for wales .
" we are looking forward to a bright future for wales , not painting a dark , inaccurate picture of the past as labour has done . "

sales fell by a larger-than-expected 5.1 % from the previous month , the biggest fall in almost eight years , the federal statistics office reported .
germany raised value-added tax on purchases to 19 % on 1 january , in an attempt to lift federal finances .
experts have warned that the vat rise will crimp spending in the first three months of the year .
" this is a real blow , " said sebastian wanke at dekabank .
" this exceeds the worst fears .
aggressive rebates and mild weather should have lured consumers into the stores .
we still ca n't exclude the possibility of a vat shock . "
january 's slide followed a surprise gain in december , when demand for household goods and clothing saw retail sales in europe 's biggest economy rise by 2.4 % .
the latest figures exclude vehicle and petrol sales and are based on data from six german states , which account for more than two-thirds of total sales .
