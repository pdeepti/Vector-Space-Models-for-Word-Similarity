last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "

speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .

kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .
otherwise there is a painful future waiting for the country that is not only a hinge between cultures and religions but also in the crosshairs of superpowers and international terrorism . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish service -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .

the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 21.07.2007 facing reality , europe moves to lure skilled immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german green card flopped partly because it was restricted to five years germany is n't the only eu country trying to attract skilled immigrants .
with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" her aim is to ensure ... further actions to improve the safety track record of chinese manufactured non-food consumer goods , " said the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
china ’ s cheap labor market has made it the world ’ s factory , producing consumer goods at a fraction of the price of western manufacturers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .

it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .

the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .

foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .

the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .

with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 21.07.2007 facing reality , europe moves to lure skilled immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german green card flopped partly because it was restricted to five years germany is n't the only eu country trying to attract skilled immigrants .
with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .

with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .

the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries .

the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .
otherwise there is a painful future waiting for the country that is not only a hinge between cultures and religions but also in the crosshairs of superpowers and international terrorism . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish service -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 21.07.2007 facing reality , europe moves to lure skilled immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german green card flopped partly because it was restricted to five years germany is n't the only eu country trying to attract skilled immigrants .
with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she will also visit toy factories and a testing laboratory .
" her aim is to ensure ... further actions to improve the safety track record of chinese manufactured non-food consumer goods , " said the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
china ’ s cheap labor market has made it the world ’ s factory , producing consumer goods at a fraction of the price of western manufacturers .

with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .

the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?

speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .

soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .

speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .

the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .

none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .

speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "
germans have been criticizing cruise since 1996 when the actor played in " mission impossible . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.07.2007 plotter 's grandson cast in hitler movie with tom cruise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise 's casting as stauffenberg has stirred a controversy in germany germany 's stauffenberg family has broken ranks over a controversial true-life movie in which tom cruise is to depict their ancestor who tried to kill nazi dictator adolf hitler , with a family member playing in the film . the film 's production company said on friday that philipp von schulthess , who is a grandson of count claus von stauffenberg , would play the role of a 1944 german army adjutant in the film " valkyrie , " which began shooting this week .
last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "
germans have been criticizing cruise since 1996 when the actor played in " mission impossible . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 21.07.2007 facing reality , europe moves to lure skilled immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german green card flopped partly because it was restricted to five years germany is n't the only eu country trying to attract skilled immigrants .
with the continent 's population graying and personnel shortfalls in key areas , most european nations are scrambling to lure talent from abroad . amid calls in germany from some politicians and businesses to lower barriers for highly-skilled immigrants , experts say europe is finally waking up to the economic benefits that these foreign workers bring . georges lemaitre , an expert on migration at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , says that if states want to attract essential workers and avoid alienating already existing immigrant populations , they will need to change public discourse as well as legislation . " here -lsb- in europe -rsb- you have politicians ready to use the issue for political ends .
i 'm flabbergasted by this .
i think xenophobia exists everywhere , but i 'm a north american and there you have a consensus that this issue is too sensitive to be used in this way , " said lemaitre . " it 's something that political parties need to manage very carefully , " he added party-political football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's green card scheme failed to draw the foreign talent it was meant to that could be one reason why germany 's much-touted green card scheme , modeled on the american one , flopped so spectacularly . in 2000 , a top politician of the then opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , coined the populist slogan " kinder statt inder " or " children rather than indians " during a regional election campaign .
the move was meant to stir fears among voters that the planned green card scheme would see an influx of skilled foreigners , indians among them , who would take away jobs from germans . in addition to the tight bureaucratic restrictions largely blamed for the green card scheme 's failure , lemaitre said germany also faces fundamental problems when it comes to attracting highly qualified migrants from abroad . " language is a major obstacle .
-lsb- immigrants -rsb- really need to speak very good german if they are to feel comfortable , " he said , adding that in germany 's mainly small and medium-sized businesses the working language is german . " where is the pool of people who are going to speak german ?
france , britain and spain are privileged in having large numbers of native speakers of their languages outside their boundaries . " lemaitre pointed out that other european nations faced with similar language problems are struggling to draw top talent from overseas . " in the netherlands they 're also having difficulties attracting people .
they have tax breaks for highly skilled people . " he said . lemaitre believes the solution is to attract younger immigrants , preferably as students . wooing students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say germany should focus on training and holding on to talented students the sentiment is shared by the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- . " we want first and foremost to enable students who have got a good degree in germany to be offered immediate professional prospects , and their whole families should also have the prospect of staying on or joining them from the outset , " said peter clever , a member of the bda executive board . " this is the only way that germany will become an interesting option for highly-qualified researchers and technical specialists , because , of course , they want a long-term perspective , " he said . at the moment , entry to germany for highly qualified workers from non-eu countries is pegged to the yearly salary of the job they have been offered .
the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she will also visit toy factories and a testing laboratory .
" her aim is to ensure ... further actions to improve the safety track record of chinese manufactured non-food consumer goods , " said the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
china ’ s cheap labor market has made it the world ’ s factory , producing consumer goods at a fraction of the price of western manufacturers .

she will also visit toy factories and a testing laboratory .
" her aim is to ensure ... further actions to improve the safety track record of chinese manufactured non-food consumer goods , " said the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
china ’ s cheap labor market has made it the world ’ s factory , producing consumer goods at a fraction of the price of western manufacturers .
in 2006 , china exported goods worth 191 billion euros -lrb- $ 264 billion -rrb- to the eu , running up a trade surplus of 128 billion euros .

the worst scandals have occurred in the united states , where toxic dog and cat food imported from china was responsible for multiple animal deaths .
officials said kuneva would also discuss issues such as enforcement of safety and quality standards , rapid alert systems and effective market surveillance .
rebuilding trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soft toys are an area of concern for the eu the commissioner will insist that " trust in the market is essential , " an official said , adding that it was in both china and the eu 's interest to build strong co-operation and to expand the eu-china product safety monitoring system .
china is keen to take action on safety concerns in order to avoid a loss of consumer confidence .
the recent spate of incidents culminated in china executing a former drug and safety chief earlier this month for corruption .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .

the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .

it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .

depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .

the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .

foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "
germans have been criticizing cruise since 1996 when the actor played in " mission impossible . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .
otherwise there is a painful future waiting for the country that is not only a hinge between cultures and religions but also in the crosshairs of superpowers and international terrorism . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish service -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .
when the military staged a coup on sept .
12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .
otherwise there is a painful future waiting for the country that is not only a hinge between cultures and religions but also in the crosshairs of superpowers and international terrorism . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish service -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the threshold stands at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 117,156 -rrb- , far in excess of what can be expected in most starting positions . with shortages now being reported in the engineering and electronic sectors , a number of leading christian democrats , currently in government with the social democrats , are pushing for the salary bar to be lowered to 40,000 euros . but the bda says the government needs to do more to address the situation .
it is pushing for the introduction of a points-based system , such as exists in a number of major " new world " countries . awarding points the oecd says that europe is beginning to gravitate towards canadian or australian models of managing immigration . britain is currently in the process of changing its entire immigration scheme to one based on points , replacing a myriad of different routes to get into the country .
the aim is to facilitate entry to those whose skills are deemed of particular benefit to the uk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's graying population is a major reason to look abroad for skilled workers applicants will be categorized in five different groups , with doctors , engineers and it specialists included in the top bracket who will be able to come to britain without a job offer .
factors such as youth and previous earnings will also be taken into account . europe seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic , self-centered approach to immigration .
even the nordic countries , according to georges lemaitre from the oecd , have less compunction now than in the past about the impact on emerging or developing countries , where foreign students only used to be eligible for residence permits if they first returned home for five years after completing studies in scandinavia . the effect of europe 's push to attract highly qualified workers from elsewhere varies from country to country , according to oecd research . " there is a serious " brain drain " problem in africa and the caribbean .
in china and india this is not the case .
they 're putting out so many people each year , " lemaitre said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.07.2007 opinion : all eyes on military leaders after turkish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 42 million turks are going to the polls on sunday , but the parliament they choose may not have a very long lifespan and the military may again interrupt the democratic process , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . ahead of parliamentary elections in turkey , it 's not just the anticipated distribution of seats in the assembly that is driving the public 's discussions .
speculations also surround the date the public will make its next trip to the poll , which is expected to be sometime this year .
the newly elected national assembly and turkey 's 60th national government could go down in history as the country 's shortest government in the republic 's 84-year history .
turkish democracy remains so unfathomable because the polarization between the secular nationalists and the religious conservatives has driven turkey into a dead end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör both friends and enemies can , however , agree that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's religious-conservative justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- will increase its take from the 34 percent of votes it received five years ago to over 40 percent , as is predicted by polls that can be taken seriously .
it is also clear that about 30 mostly " independent " kurdish representatives will be elected to parliament .
kurdish politicians have labeled themselves " independent " to circumvent a 10-percent hurdle that has kept pro-kurdish parties out of parliament in all their previous attempts .
despite the high percentage of votes it will recieve , erdogan 's akp will have fewer of the 550 parliamentary seats and will not achieve the nearly two-thirds majority of 367 mandates it currently enjoys .
the akp may still be able to govern without a coalition partner , but even that is uncertain .
depending on their strength in the election , the nationalistic movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- and the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , which was founded by atatürk , may have enough power to form a coalition and push erdogan into the opposition .
the kurds could then become the finger that tips the scales if they throw their support behind a coalition with the akp .
in any case , it is hardly expected that the kurds will give their support to the left or the nationalistic right .
the lifespan of the coming legislative period may be the shortest in the country 's history if the parliament does not succeed in electing the country 's president within two months .
if there is no head of state the parliament can not dedicate itself to supporting , it can not begin its actual legislative tasks and would be forced to dissolve itself .
foreign minister abdullah gül was nominated for the post by the akp and would have been elected if the army had not declared him persona non grata for the country 's highest office .
the fact that the constitutional court declared the parliament 's vote invalid permitted a referendum on whether the public should choose the next president .
none of turkey 's political parties has suggested other candidates for the job .
this is the point where all turkish eyes turn to the military leaders .
the army still represents an insurmountable hurdle for civil turkish bodies .
this is because the army sees itself as the protector of the secular republic - based on the reforms instituted by atatürk , the country 's founder - and because it would not accept a change of direction that would diminish turkey 's laity , the strict separation of religion and state affairs .
this is exactly what erdogan is being accused of because he is suspected of promoting the islamization of turkey by means of democracy .
unfortunately , it can therefore be expected that the generals will not be shy , about intervening and temporarily abandoning a pluralistic democracy , as occurred in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 .
the spoiling will , at any rate , come after the choosing .
none of the parties can offer a panacea .
the daily rising death toll from the fight with the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan workers ' party -rrb- is adding to the already enormous domestic pressure .
soldiers ' burials are time and again turned into nationalistic demonstrations aimed against the akp .
meanwhile the burials of kurds lead to protest demonstrations aimed against the state and often lead to violent confrontations .
considering all of these circumstances , it does n't come as a surprise that turkey 's eu accession talks have been marginalized as far as the election campaign goes .
erdogan 's faint attempts to influence european governments ' turkey policies , such as during the recent german integration summit , have not helped in the domestic confrontation .
it remains to be feared that history repeats itself and turkey falls into another sorrowful period .
a political fight for power in the 70s led to circumstances similar to a civil war , during which some 5,000 people were killed in 1980 alone .

12 , 1980 , it was not just people in turkey but europeans as well who exhaled and at first did n't give another thought to democracy .
the long-term damage three years of military rule had on democracy and justice , however , has still not been completely remedied and the wounds have still not healed .
for this reason it would be advisable for the parties and politicians to back away from extreme positions and end the political crisis by showing a democratic willingness to compromise .
otherwise there is a painful future waiting for the country that is not only a hinge between cultures and religions but also in the crosshairs of superpowers and international terrorism . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish service -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , the late hero 's son berthold von stauffenberg forecast the film would be " rubbish " and said it was " not nice " that a " practicing scientologist " was playing the part of his father .
german politicians have continued to assail cruise 's philosophy of life as harmful , outraging us commentators who said he was being victimized on account of his creed .
a us-german co-production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting of " valkyrie " began at the babelsberg studios near berlin on thursday the film , directed by bryan singer , 41 , is a joint production by us and german studios and has qualified for 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- in grants from germany 's film industry board .
it was not known friday how schulthess came to be in the cast , but it appeared he had attended an audition .
studio babelsberg also disclosed that hitler would be played by british actor david bamber , who played a bob geldof look-alike in the movie " i am bob " earlier this year .
the production company said cruise was present during the second day of filming .
not exactly a perfect match on friday , the 63rd anniversary of the july 20 coup attempt , german newspapers reviewed other reasons why cruise , 45 , might make a poor plotter such as the age difference : stauffenberg was 36 .
the mass-circulation bild noted that stauffenberg was about 1.85 metres tall and cruise less than 1.70 .
officials deny that scientology was the reason rules were not relaxed to allow location shooting in a government office building where colonel stauffenberg had his office and was summarily shot by the nazis .
germany , which bans anti-democracy groups and monitors neo-nazis , keeps scientology under surveillance .
junior politicians have continued to attack cruise .
" stauffenberg risked his life for freedom , " said rudolf köberle , state secretary for interior issues in baden-wuerttemberg state .
" it sullies his heritage to have a scientology adherent act him . "
germans have been criticizing cruise since 1996 when the actor played in " mission impossible . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they represent the biggest expense for many households , but are not included in the consumer prices index -lrb- cpi -rrb- .
mr king acknowledges the omission is " controversial " and causes " particular difficulty " for the bank .
his comments come as economists debate whether interest rates should rise again to keep inflation in check .
the monetary policy committee 's task is ensure the cpi stays within range of 2 % , a target set by the government .
in the past year , the committee has increased interest rates five times to 5.75 % , the highest level since 2001 .
however , fears about inflation persist .
the cpi fell to 2.4 % in june , official figures show .
but at the same time , the more familiar retail prices index , which does take mortgage costs into account , rose to 4.4 % .
some critics fear the cpi may not reflect the true cost of living and that could mean interest rates are still not high enough to keep inflation properly under control .
' surprising ' omission speaking to bbc radio 4 's inside money programme , mervyn king said the cpi is a broad measure of a representative sample of goods and services .
however , he admitted the absence of mortgage costs is " surprising " . "
if we have made wrong decisions there ca n't have been very many of them " mervyn king " some of these issues are controversial .
i wish it did include housing , but it does n't - at least at present .
maybe one day it will , " he said .
the reason , he explained , is because of the way the index has been designed .
" cpi is meant to be constructed in the same manner in all european countries , and so far the european statisticians have not worked out a way of how they can calculate the cost of housing in a way that can be done uniformly across europe , " he said .
overall mr king defended the performance of the monetary policy committee since its inception in 1997 .
" the track record is pretty good , so if we have made wrong decisions from time to time , there ca n't have been very many of them and they ca n't have been that wrong , " he said .
" the monetary policy committee i think was well designed , " he added .
" i think it 's been successful for 10 years and i see no reason to believe that it can not be successful for another 10 years and decades after that . "

they represent the biggest expense for many households , but are not included in the consumer prices index -lrb- cpi -rrb- .
mr king acknowledges the omission is " controversial " and causes " particular difficulty " for the bank .
his comments come as economists debate whether interest rates should rise again to keep inflation in check .
the monetary policy committee 's task is ensure the cpi stays within range of 2 % , a target set by the government .
in the past year , the committee has increased interest rates five times to 5.75 % , the highest level since 2001 .
however , fears about inflation persist .
the cpi fell to 2.4 % in june , official figures show .
but at the same time , the more familiar retail prices index , which does take mortgage costs into account , rose to 4.4 % .
some critics fear the cpi may not reflect the true cost of living and that could mean interest rates are still not high enough to keep inflation properly under control .
' surprising ' omission speaking to bbc radio 4 's inside money programme , mervyn king said the cpi is a broad measure of a representative sample of goods and services .
however , he admitted the absence of mortgage costs is " surprising " .
if we have made wrong decisions there ca n't have been very many of them mervyn king " some of these issues are controversial .
i wish it did include housing , but it does n't - at least at present .
maybe one day it will , " he said .
the reason , he explained , is because of the way the index has been designed .
" cpi is meant to be constructed in the same manner in all european countries , and so far the european statisticians have not worked out a way of how they can calculate the cost of housing in a way that can be done uniformly across europe , " he said .
overall mr king defended the performance of the monetary policy committee since its inception in 1997 .
" the track record is pretty good , so if we have made wrong decisions from time to time , there ca n't have been very many of them and they ca n't have been that wrong , " he said .
" the monetary policy committee i think was well designed , " he added .
" i think it 's been successful for 10 years and i see no reason to believe that it can not be successful for another 10 years and decades after that . "

in the memo , leaked to the daily telegraph , gen sir richard dannatt said the army was undermanned because of operations in afghanistan and iraq .
he also said vital equipment was being used " at the edge of sustainability " .
a spokesman for the ministry of defence said the forces were working hard but the current situation was " manageable " .
gen dannatt also said the army has " almost no capability to react to the unexpected " .
he said : " it is difficult to predict the long-term effect of this level of pressure on people .
it is critical that we improve manning as quickly as we can . "
there is reportedly just one battalion of 500 troops , called the spearhead lead element , available to be used in an emergency , such as a major domestic terrorist attack or a rapid deployment overseas .
bbc defence correspondent paul wood said the army currently comprised about 98,000 personnel , some 2,000 soldiers short of capacity .
he said the internal memo was leaked to put political pressure on the government ahead of a spending review .
" although clearly there 's politics at play here , i think this is a heartfelt plea from gen dannatt that if things are just about sustainable now , it can not go on for much longer like this , " our correspondent added .
revisit planning the document also said that britain 's second back-up unit , the airborne task force , which is formed around the parachute regiment , could not deploy fully .
it blamed this on " shortages in manpower , equipment and stocks " .
the mod conceded that if " operations continue at this pace , we will have to revisit our planning assumptions " .
the spokesman added : " in recent months , we have drawn down our force levels in a number of operations .
" the armed forces ' mission in northern ireland will end on 31 july ; we withdrew the bulk of our forces from bosnia-herzegovina earlier this year and ... we will reduce further our force levels in iraq by 500 . "
it is critical that we improve manning as quickly as we can " gen sir richard dannatt " we are certainly not complacent about the longer term implications , which we are acutely aware of and are addressing . "
liam fox , the shadow defence secretary , said the lack of reserves was " an appalling situation and damning indictment " of the way the government handled the services .
" they are being asked to carry out tasks for which they are neither funded nor equipped .
there is an urgent need to review our strategic approach because we can not continue over-stretching our forces . "
in october gen dannatt said that the presence of uk armed forces in iraq " exacerbates the security problems " and they should " get out some time soon " .
he also said that initial planning for the post-war period had been poor .

in the memo , leaked to the daily telegraph , gen sir richard dannatt said the army was undermanned because of operations in afghanistan and iraq .
he also said vital equipment was being used " at the edge of sustainability " .
a spokesman for the ministry of defence said the forces were working hard but the current situation was " manageable " .
gen dannatt also said the army has " almost no capability to react to the unexpected " .
he said : " it is difficult to predict the long-term effect of this level of pressure on people .
it is critical that we improve manning as quickly as we can . "
there is reportedly just one battalion of 500 troops , called the spearhead lead element , available to be used in an emergency , such as a major domestic terrorist attack or a rapid deployment overseas .
bbc defence correspondent paul wood said the army currently comprised about 98,000 personnel , some 2,000 soldiers short of capacity .
he said the internal memo was leaked to put political pressure on the government ahead of a spending review .
" although clearly there 's politics at play here , i think this is a heartfelt plea from gen dannatt that if things are just about sustainable now , it can not go on for much longer like this , " our correspondent added .
revisit planning the document also said that britain 's second back-up unit , the airborne task force , which is formed around the parachute regiment , could not deploy fully .
it blamed this on " shortages in manpower , equipment and stocks " .
the mod conceded that if " operations continue at this pace , we will have to revisit our planning assumptions " .
the spokesman added : " in recent months , we have drawn down our force levels in a number of operations .
" the armed forces ' mission in northern ireland will end on 31 july ; we withdrew the bulk of our forces from bosnia-herzegovina earlier this year and ... we will reduce further our force levels in iraq by 500 .
it is critical that we improve manning as quickly as we can gen sir richard dannatt " we are certainly not complacent about the longer term implications , which we are acutely aware of and are addressing . "
liam fox , the shadow defence secretary , said the lack of reserves was " an appalling situation and damning indictment " of the way the government handled the services .
" they are being asked to carry out tasks for which they are neither funded nor equipped .
there is an urgent need to review our strategic approach because we can not continue over-stretching our forces . "
in october gen dannatt said that the presence of uk armed forces in iraq " exacerbates the security problems " and they should " get out some time soon " .
he also said that initial planning for the post-war period had been poor .

sir liam donaldson told the daily telegraph he would " strongly commend " the use of tax as a deterrent to excessive drinking .
and he said a ban should be considered on drinks companies sponsoring sporting activities and fitness-linked events .
sir liam also said he would welcome a review of 24-hour licensing .
he said : " in our culture , getting drunk is seen as an exciting and status thing to do .
we need to try and get away from that .
under control " i worry about the overall problem of alcohol misuse , the rising levels of cirrhosis .
" tobacco is a good example of a public health problem that is in hand , but when we turn to obesity and alcohol misuse those are not yet anywhere near under control . "
sir liam also spoke about the relaxation of licensing hours , a measure that was introduced in november 2005 .
" some of us worried about the decision when it was brought in and any review of the policy would be welcome . "
he also added that changes in the law on sponsorship by drinks companies would be " fruitful " .
he said : " it 's something that worked with tobacco .
i would say that there 's fruitful things to be looked at in that territory . "
