" it has not yet been made official , but informally minister steinmeier has suggested that the fuel cycle be made international , " erler told the conference .
" we are in the process of considering how we can take these proposals forward and formalize them .
at present there is great interest from various sides . " steinmeier first floated the idea of central enrichment site that would provide nuclear fuel to interested nations before a meeting of the international atomic energy agency last september . uranium would not be weapons grade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries can produce nuclear energy under the non-proliferation treaty as current president of the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , germany could potentially put finding a multilateral approach to enriching uranium on the international agenda . observers present at the conference , where several international approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle were presented , said a shared facility would eliminate the need for countries to create their own enrichment operations and lower the risk of the facilities being used to produce nuclear weapons . instead of enriching their own nuclear fuel , states would legally obtain fuel rods from enrichment centers outside their borders and under the control of the united nations . the fuel used in atomic power reactors is similar , but not as highly enriched , as the radioactive material used in nuclear bombs . plan to include more than only iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and the west are divided on the intentions of tehran 's nuclear program erler said the program would be aimed at more countries than only iran , with which the un has engaged in drawn-out nuclear negotiations as the united states and eu fear it is developing nuclear weapons .
tehran , however , insists its nuclear program is of a purely peaceful nature . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said on monday that his agency was still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , as the united states claims it is , adding that it was " long overdue " for iran to " answer all the agency 's questions and concerns about its past nuclear activities in an open and transparent manner . " the european union prepared to deliver a statement on thursday in which the bloc " reaffirms its continuous support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " according to a copy of the text shown to the afp news agency . the statement said " a comprehensive offer is still on the table and the door remains open , " referring to a deal of trade , security and technology benefits for iran if it guarantees it will not seek nuclear weapons . the eu also said it " deplores that iran has not complied with the terms of unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution 1737 , " which calls on iran to halt uranium enrichment work and to stop building a nuclear reactor . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forum seeks new strategies towards global disarmament arms control is waning worldwide , as weapons of mass destruction and other arms increasingly threaten global security .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating .

" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .

" a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2007 germany debates travel 's environmental impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the travel industry expects more germans to take off on vacation in 2007 the world 's largest travel fair opened wednesday in berlin , just as politicians and environmental protection groups debated the sustainability of jetting off to foreign destinations for a vacation break . faced with international terrorism , the war in iraq and bird flu , the travel industry is used to dealing with one crisis after another , but participants at the international tourism exchange -lrb- itb -rrb- in berlin now have a new reason for concern : vacationers who choose to stay home to prevent global warming . visitors to the world 's biggest travel exhibition would need to climb aboard a plane before they 're able to see most of the 184 regions of the world being presented by nearly 11,000 exhibitors , and that 's exactly what some environmental protection organizations are trying to avoid . planes hurting the planet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alps and baltic sea are germany 's most popular vacation destinations " whoever wants to do something for climate protection should avoid plane trips and vacation in germany , " said manfred stock of the potsdam institute for climate impact research . short flights are especially harmful to the environment , according to greenpeace germany head brigitte behrens . " weekend trips by plane are out of bounds from a climate point of view , " she said .
" discount flights at cut-rate prices should be forbidden . " some 20 percent of germans have traveled on discount airlines and would also consider booking a low-cost flight , according to a tns infratest survey . environmental protection groups have called for an end to germany protecting jet fuel from taxes , a step german economics minster michael glos rejected . " what 's the sense of one airline paying a fuel tax and its competition flying the same route without added costs ? " he asked , insisting on an international response to climate protection . balance between economy and environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plane contrails and cirrus cloud effects were not accounted for in global warming estimates glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though it added that the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . glos also said more needs to be taken into account than the environment , as travel plays an important role in the country 's economy , and additional taxes could hurt competition by making german carriers more expensive and endangering airline jobs . germans spent about 60.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- on travel last year , and the vacation and travel research group estimated that 70 percent of germans were planning at least one trip in 2007 , the highest percentage since 2001 and a 3-percent increase over 2006 . a changing industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future itb trade fairs will also have to deal with climate protection travel industry officials said they realized climate change would be of growing importance . " it is an issue we have to face as a sector , " said mario köpers , a spokesman for thomas cook travel . itb head martin buck told the süddeutsche zeitung on monday that he was concerned about the travel industry 's future . " in a few years it will no longer be chic for large portions of the population to poison the environment with too much co2 during vacations , " he said . tui spokesman robin zimmerman told the paper the current political discussion was being exaggerated and had " little to do with german vacation reality . "
about a third of germans spend their vacations in their home country , and travel giants tui and thomas cook both said germany was second only to spain as a destination for german vacations . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.03.2007 poland heads for eu crash over highway in nature haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed highway would cut through rospuda valley in northeast poland for some , the via baltica highway is northeast poland 's ticket to economic prosperity .
the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.03.2007 poland heads for eu crash over highway in nature haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed highway would cut through rospuda valley in northeast poland for some , the via baltica highway is northeast poland 's ticket to economic prosperity .
the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .

elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .
" it is a unique nature area in central europe , and not only belongs to the polish people , but also to the people of europe , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels seeks power to jail international polluters the eu drafted a plan to harmonize european law on serious environmental crimes and set minimum cross-border penalties .
it is the eu commission 's second-ever foray into individual governments ' criminal law .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

" " if we act decisively now , we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change , " she said in her invitation to the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore says the eu is vital to leading the way on green issues merkel told the british financial times newspaper on wednesday that she wanted " europe to take a ' pioneering lead ' on meaningful green initiatives . " merkel was seconded by former us vice president , al gore who recently picked up an oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming . speaking to reporters on a visit to brussels to address a conference on biofuels , gore said a european lead on the issue was vital .
" i 'm trying to get my country to change its policies , but in the meantime the european union is absolutely key to helping the world make the change it must , " he said . securing energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for an energy rethink in europe ?
british prime minister tony blair said that europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change , but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition . " i think there is the real possibility of showing how europe can lead the debate on climate change , on energy security , and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive european economy , " blair said on tuesday in london . eu leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels , and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies , particularly china and india , join them . the european union produces about 14 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions while the united states , the world 's largest polluter , produces some 25 percent . although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity , tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources . one of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of europe 's energy needs by 2020 , after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on monday . environmentalists : " it 's not enough " although europe is leading efforts to combat climate change , some environmentalists warned that the eu leaders are not aiming high enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel engines are popular in europe , sooty particles in the exhaust are not " the eu 's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making europe 's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened , " said friends of the earth climate campaigner jan kowalzig . energy policy has climbed to the top of the eu political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs . however , despite the growing importance attached to energy , the eu has struggled to hammer out a common approach , with member countries often putting national interests first , much to the frustration of the european commission . increasing competition such is the case with a european commission idea to inject greater competition into the eu energy market with plans to make large , integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks . leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with france and to a lesser extent germany opposed to the idea , which could cause a major shake-up of french and german energy groups . the summit comes amid a shifting european political landscape with italian prime minister romano prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis , british prime minister tony blair increasingly a lame duck , and looming french presidential elections in april and may . it will also be french president jacques chirac 's last chance to leave his mark on eu policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending french interests during meetings with eu leaders . looking ahead as germany chairs the group of eight industrial nations this year , merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week 's meetings into the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany in june . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

" it has not yet been made official , but informally minister steinmeier has suggested that the fuel cycle be made international , " erler told the conference .
" we are in the process of considering how we can take these proposals forward and formalize them .
at present there is great interest from various sides . " steinmeier first floated the idea of central enrichment site that would provide nuclear fuel to interested nations before a meeting of the international atomic energy agency last september . uranium would not be weapons grade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries can produce nuclear energy under the non-proliferation treaty as current president of the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , germany could potentially put finding a multilateral approach to enriching uranium on the international agenda . observers present at the conference , where several international approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle were presented , said a shared facility would eliminate the need for countries to create their own enrichment operations and lower the risk of the facilities being used to produce nuclear weapons . instead of enriching their own nuclear fuel , states would legally obtain fuel rods from enrichment centers outside their borders and under the control of the united nations . the fuel used in atomic power reactors is similar , but not as highly enriched , as the radioactive material used in nuclear bombs . plan to include more than only iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and the west are divided on the intentions of tehran 's nuclear program erler said the program would be aimed at more countries than only iran , with which the un has engaged in drawn-out nuclear negotiations as the united states and eu fear it is developing nuclear weapons .
tehran , however , insists its nuclear program is of a purely peaceful nature . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said on monday that his agency was still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , as the united states claims it is , adding that it was " long overdue " for iran to " answer all the agency 's questions and concerns about its past nuclear activities in an open and transparent manner . " the european union prepared to deliver a statement on thursday in which the bloc " reaffirms its continuous support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " according to a copy of the text shown to the afp news agency . the statement said " a comprehensive offer is still on the table and the door remains open , " referring to a deal of trade , security and technology benefits for iran if it guarantees it will not seek nuclear weapons . the eu also said it " deplores that iran has not complied with the terms of unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution 1737 , " which calls on iran to halt uranium enrichment work and to stop building a nuclear reactor . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forum seeks new strategies towards global disarmament arms control is waning worldwide , as weapons of mass destruction and other arms increasingly threaten global security .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .
" it is a unique nature area in central europe , and not only belongs to the polish people , but also to the people of europe , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels seeks power to jail international polluters the eu drafted a plan to harmonize european law on serious environmental crimes and set minimum cross-border penalties .
it is the eu commission 's second-ever foray into individual governments ' criminal law .
-lrb- 08.02.2007 -rrb- eu clamps down on members for breaking environmental laws the european commission has clamped down on member states , with a flurry of legal actions against them for failing to respect eu environmental laws .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects .

via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

" " if we act decisively now , we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change , " she said in her invitation to the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore says the eu is vital to leading the way on green issues merkel told the british financial times newspaper on wednesday that she wanted " europe to take a ' pioneering lead ' on meaningful green initiatives . " merkel was seconded by former us vice president , al gore who recently picked up an oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming . speaking to reporters on a visit to brussels to address a conference on biofuels , gore said a european lead on the issue was vital .
" i 'm trying to get my country to change its policies , but in the meantime the european union is absolutely key to helping the world make the change it must , " he said . securing energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for an energy rethink in europe ?
british prime minister tony blair said that europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change , but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition . " i think there is the real possibility of showing how europe can lead the debate on climate change , on energy security , and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive european economy , " blair said on tuesday in london . eu leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels , and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies , particularly china and india , join them . the european union produces about 14 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions while the united states , the world 's largest polluter , produces some 25 percent . although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity , tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources . one of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of europe 's energy needs by 2020 , after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on monday . environmentalists : " it 's not enough " although europe is leading efforts to combat climate change , some environmentalists warned that the eu leaders are not aiming high enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel engines are popular in europe , sooty particles in the exhaust are not " the eu 's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making europe 's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened , " said friends of the earth climate campaigner jan kowalzig . energy policy has climbed to the top of the eu political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs . however , despite the growing importance attached to energy , the eu has struggled to hammer out a common approach , with member countries often putting national interests first , much to the frustration of the european commission . increasing competition such is the case with a european commission idea to inject greater competition into the eu energy market with plans to make large , integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks . leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with france and to a lesser extent germany opposed to the idea , which could cause a major shake-up of french and german energy groups . the summit comes amid a shifting european political landscape with italian prime minister romano prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis , british prime minister tony blair increasingly a lame duck , and looming french presidential elections in april and may . it will also be french president jacques chirac 's last chance to leave his mark on eu policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending french interests during meetings with eu leaders . looking ahead as germany chairs the group of eight industrial nations this year , merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week 's meetings into the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany in june . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

she is , of course , also responsible for being the perfect host at the upcoming eu and g8 summits . and with france 's connoisseur president jacques chirac at the table , merkel is n't taking any chances . according to wine industry officials , the chancellor has handpicked just which nectar of the gods will be served during dinner . finding the right red wine for chirac 's palate germany , of course , has nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to wine . germany leads the world in production of the white wine riesling , which has enjoyed a global renaissance over the past decade , said michael prince zu salm-salm , president of the vdp , an elite group of top german wine producers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit wine comes from the vineyards of eberbach monastery but merkel 's protocol office was stumped when it came to the red wine and contacted the prince for assistance .
after all , there are fewer growers of world-class red wines in germany and prince zu salm-salm said merkel was concerned about serving a wine that would measure up to chirac 's standards . merkel is right to be worried about the gastronomically outspoken french president .
two years ago , chirac slammed finnish food as the worst in europe followed by that of britain . " one ca n't trust people who have a cuisine that bad , " chirac was quoted as saying in reference to british cooking . that stinging criticism did little for france 's relations with either country and merkel clearly wants to prevent any such outbursts from overshadowing the summits she is hosting . merkel has chosen " hell 's mountain " to drink so what can political leaders expect in their glasses ?
after the vdp sent over samples of 12 leading red wines to the chancellery , merkel chose a 2003 " assmannshausen höllenberg spätburgunder , " a pinot noir from the rheingau region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to play the perfect host it will be served at the eu summits in brussels this week and in berlin on march 25 as well as at at the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june . although its name literally translates as " hell 's mountain , " it 's actually a corruption of the german word halden , which describes the steep vineyards where the grapes are grown . nonetheless , it should certainly liven up merkel 's meetings .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .

" graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .

" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .

" " if we act decisively now , we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change , " she said in her invitation to the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore says the eu is vital to leading the way on green issues merkel told the british financial times newspaper on wednesday that she wanted " europe to take a ' pioneering lead ' on meaningful green initiatives . " merkel was seconded by former us vice president , al gore who recently picked up an oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming . speaking to reporters on a visit to brussels to address a conference on biofuels , gore said a european lead on the issue was vital .
" i 'm trying to get my country to change its policies , but in the meantime the european union is absolutely key to helping the world make the change it must , " he said . securing energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for an energy rethink in europe ?
british prime minister tony blair said that europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change , but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition . " i think there is the real possibility of showing how europe can lead the debate on climate change , on energy security , and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive european economy , " blair said on tuesday in london . eu leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels , and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies , particularly china and india , join them . the european union produces about 14 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions while the united states , the world 's largest polluter , produces some 25 percent . although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity , tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources . one of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of europe 's energy needs by 2020 , after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on monday . environmentalists : " it 's not enough " although europe is leading efforts to combat climate change , some environmentalists warned that the eu leaders are not aiming high enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel engines are popular in europe , sooty particles in the exhaust are not " the eu 's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making europe 's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened , " said friends of the earth climate campaigner jan kowalzig . energy policy has climbed to the top of the eu political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs . however , despite the growing importance attached to energy , the eu has struggled to hammer out a common approach , with member countries often putting national interests first , much to the frustration of the european commission . increasing competition such is the case with a european commission idea to inject greater competition into the eu energy market with plans to make large , integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks . leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with france and to a lesser extent germany opposed to the idea , which could cause a major shake-up of french and german energy groups . the summit comes amid a shifting european political landscape with italian prime minister romano prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis , british prime minister tony blair increasingly a lame duck , and looming french presidential elections in april and may . it will also be french president jacques chirac 's last chance to leave his mark on eu policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending french interests during meetings with eu leaders . looking ahead as germany chairs the group of eight industrial nations this year , merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week 's meetings into the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany in june . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

" it has not yet been made official , but informally minister steinmeier has suggested that the fuel cycle be made international , " erler told the conference .
" we are in the process of considering how we can take these proposals forward and formalize them .
at present there is great interest from various sides .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits . chancellor angela merkel had her work cut out for her when germany took over the rotating eu and g8 presidencies in january .
breathing new life into the nearly dead european constitution , reviving international efforts for peace in the middle east or battling climate change - all are top items on germany 's agenda . but merkel does n't just face political challenges .
she is , of course , also responsible for being the perfect host at the upcoming eu and g8 summits . and with france 's connoisseur president jacques chirac at the table , merkel is n't taking any chances . according to wine industry officials , the chancellor has handpicked just which nectar of the gods will be served during dinner . finding the right red wine for chirac 's palate germany , of course , has nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to wine . germany leads the world in production of the white wine riesling , which has enjoyed a global renaissance over the past decade , said michael prince zu salm-salm , president of the vdp , an elite group of top german wine producers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit wine comes from the vineyards of eberbach monastery but merkel 's protocol office was stumped when it came to the red wine and contacted the prince for assistance .
after all , there are fewer growers of world-class red wines in germany and prince zu salm-salm said merkel was concerned about serving a wine that would measure up to chirac 's standards . merkel is right to be worried about the gastronomically outspoken french president .
two years ago , chirac slammed finnish food as the worst in europe followed by that of britain . " one ca n't trust people who have a cuisine that bad , " chirac was quoted as saying in reference to british cooking . that stinging criticism did little for france 's relations with either country and merkel clearly wants to prevent any such outbursts from overshadowing the summits she is hosting . merkel has chosen " hell 's mountain " to drink so what can political leaders expect in their glasses ?
after the vdp sent over samples of 12 leading red wines to the chancellery , merkel chose a 2003 " assmannshausen höllenberg spätburgunder , " a pinot noir from the rheingau region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to play the perfect host it will be served at the eu summits in brussels this week and in berlin on march 25 as well as at at the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june . although its name literally translates as " hell 's mountain , " it 's actually a corruption of the german word halden , which describes the steep vineyards where the grapes are grown . nonetheless , it should certainly liven up merkel 's meetings .
with an alcohol content of 15 percent , it packs a lot more punch than most red wines . " a good glass of wine will give them some good ideas , " prince zu salm-salm said .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation .

she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement .

" markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.03.2007 poland heads for eu crash over highway in nature haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed highway would cut through rospuda valley in northeast poland for some , the via baltica highway is northeast poland 's ticket to economic prosperity .
the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .
" it is a unique nature area in central europe , and not only belongs to the polish people , but also to the people of europe , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels seeks power to jail international polluters the eu drafted a plan to harmonize european law on serious environmental crimes and set minimum cross-border penalties .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.03.2007 poland heads for eu crash over highway in nature haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed highway would cut through rospuda valley in northeast poland for some , the via baltica highway is northeast poland 's ticket to economic prosperity .
the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .
" it is a unique nature area in central europe , and not only belongs to the polish people , but also to the people of europe , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels seeks power to jail international polluters the eu drafted a plan to harmonize european law on serious environmental crimes and set minimum cross-border penalties .

" it has not yet been made official , but informally minister steinmeier has suggested that the fuel cycle be made international , " erler told the conference .
" we are in the process of considering how we can take these proposals forward and formalize them .
at present there is great interest from various sides . " steinmeier first floated the idea of central enrichment site that would provide nuclear fuel to interested nations before a meeting of the international atomic energy agency last september . uranium would not be weapons grade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries can produce nuclear energy under the non-proliferation treaty as current president of the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , germany could potentially put finding a multilateral approach to enriching uranium on the international agenda . observers present at the conference , where several international approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle were presented , said a shared facility would eliminate the need for countries to create their own enrichment operations and lower the risk of the facilities being used to produce nuclear weapons . instead of enriching their own nuclear fuel , states would legally obtain fuel rods from enrichment centers outside their borders and under the control of the united nations . the fuel used in atomic power reactors is similar , but not as highly enriched , as the radioactive material used in nuclear bombs . plan to include more than only iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and the west are divided on the intentions of tehran 's nuclear program erler said the program would be aimed at more countries than only iran , with which the un has engaged in drawn-out nuclear negotiations as the united states and eu fear it is developing nuclear weapons .
tehran , however , insists its nuclear program is of a purely peaceful nature . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said on monday that his agency was still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , as the united states claims it is , adding that it was " long overdue " for iran to " answer all the agency 's questions and concerns about its past nuclear activities in an open and transparent manner . " the european union prepared to deliver a statement on thursday in which the bloc " reaffirms its continuous support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " according to a copy of the text shown to the afp news agency . the statement said " a comprehensive offer is still on the table and the door remains open , " referring to a deal of trade , security and technology benefits for iran if it guarantees it will not seek nuclear weapons . the eu also said it " deplores that iran has not complied with the terms of unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution 1737 , " which calls on iran to halt uranium enrichment work and to stop building a nuclear reactor . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forum seeks new strategies towards global disarmament arms control is waning worldwide , as weapons of mass destruction and other arms increasingly threaten global security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2007 german expellee leader compares polish parties with neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach wants to raise awareness for german wartime expellees the outspoken head of the german league of expellees has shaken fragile polish-german relations by comparing poland 's ruling parties with german far-right extremists .
polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous .

after all , there are fewer growers of world-class red wines in germany and prince zu salm-salm said merkel was concerned about serving a wine that would measure up to chirac 's standards . merkel is right to be worried about the gastronomically outspoken french president .
two years ago , chirac slammed finnish food as the worst in europe followed by that of britain . " one ca n't trust people who have a cuisine that bad , " chirac was quoted as saying in reference to british cooking . that stinging criticism did little for france 's relations with either country and merkel clearly wants to prevent any such outbursts from overshadowing the summits she is hosting . merkel has chosen " hell 's mountain " to drink so what can political leaders expect in their glasses ?

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2007 german expellee leader compares polish parties with neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach wants to raise awareness for german wartime expellees the outspoken head of the german league of expellees has shaken fragile polish-german relations by comparing poland 's ruling parties with german far-right extremists .
polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2007 e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cross-border deals in the energy sector are tricky the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .
the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation .

she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement .

" " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .

but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating .

" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it .

" a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .
helfferich of the european commission said it 's not just up to the polish to decide .
" it is a unique nature area in central europe , and not only belongs to the polish people , but also to the people of europe , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels seeks power to jail international polluters the eu drafted a plan to harmonize european law on serious environmental crimes and set minimum cross-border penalties .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .

the european commission says the planned transport corridor could harm protected nature preserves and break eu law . imagine thick , green forests as far as the eye can see .
envisage a rich peat bog and a marshland over which rare eagles soar .
elegant orchids grace the landscape ; wolves and lynx slink through the shadows . now envision a multiple-lane highway running right through it all . that 's the quagmire poland is in - the classic dilemma of economic development vs. nature protection . and time is running out for solving the quandary : possibly endanger the rare species of animals and plants living in the rospuda valley , or give up northeast poland 's and the baltic states ' hopes for a link to the eu 's urban centers and the economic opportunities that it could bring ? nature protection laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red marks the proposed route , green the alternatives by environmentalists the european commission has given poland a wednesday deadline to stop parts of a planned highway called the via baltica from being built .
the highway is designed to go through areas protected by eu environmental protection laws .
the commission and environmentalists fear that construction of the highway could endanger the rare species of plants and animals living in the rospuda valley .
marta wisniewska of the polish branch of the non-governmental organization world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the construction of the highway and accompanying fences through the nature preserves would cut off essential migratory routes for many mammals in the region .
traffic noise would also scare away birds .
eu ultimatum the eu commission says poland must first provide an official assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed highway and offer alternative routes to the proposed one to be reviewed before building can begin .
if it does not , the commission says poland is breaking eu law and would be taken to europe 's highest court .
" if poland fails to respond in a timely and satisfactory manner , the commission will consider taking urgent action and request the european court of justice to look at the case and issue an order to suspend work pending a hearing , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
should it go that far , the court could also impose heavy fines on poland and be forced to halt building .
via baltica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rospuda valley is home to 19 of poland 's 31 orchid species the roadway would connect poland to finland via the baltic states , connecting lithuania , latvia and estonia to europe 's highway network .
the dispute centers , among other things , on approval by polish authorities to build a 17-kilometer -lrb- 10-mile -rrb- stretch of the highway through the rospuda valley .
the river valley hosts an ecosystem regarded as the last of its kind in europe - home to rare species of flora and fauna .
a highway could put that at risk .
the rospuda valley is protected by natura 2000 - a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment and an ecological network program - which aims to work with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
" the polish government has defied eu requests for impact assessment and gone ahead and signed papers for work to start construction , " said barbara helferrich , european commission environment spokeswoman .
the proposed highway would also go through two other protected nature areas , which environmentalists and the eu commission say is unacceptable .
the commission already issued poland a warning last december for infringing on environmentally protected areas and in april 2006 , natura 2000 took legal action against poland for failing to protect biodiversity regions .
ready for battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland became an eu member in 2004 poland says it is prepared to defend itself should the via baltica issue go all the way to the european court of justice .
" we are ready for that because we are presenting a matter-of-fact , objective and , i think , very detailed argument of our reasons , " said polish transport minister jerzy polaczek .
poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , approved the plans for the highway ’ s construction .
polish officials argue that it would be too expensive to reroute the highway .
also , the planned part of the via baltica known as the augustow bypass is designed to ease the burden on the nearby town of augustow , which must cope with over 4,000 heavy goods trucks a day .
in addition , the landscape is lined with decrepit rural roads over which all long-distance traffic must pass .
officials say the via baltica connecting warsaw and helsinki would boost transport , alleviate augustow and help the region begin the climb out of out of poverty .
tourist traffic would also help fill regional coffers , they claim .
environmentalist protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace is known world-wide for dramatic acts but that would come at the expense of the natural environment , say the highway 's critics .
activists from greenpeace and other environmental groups have camped out in the forests for weeks , vowing to chain themselves to trees and block road construction work .
the protestors are not necessarily against construction of the highway , but they argue it should run along a different route that would cause less environmental damage .
one alternative would be designing the highway to go northwest - around the nature preserves - rather than the more northeasterly route right through them .
" frankly , we just do n't understand why polish officials do n't see that as a viable option , " said the wwf 's wisniewska .
a battle of wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski one reason could be possible corruption .
in february , polish president lech kaczynski ordered poland 's anti-corruption office to probe into possible wrong-doing in a public tender to a private company called budimex dromex for the roadway ’ s construction .
meanwhile , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - lech 's brother - has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of the rospuda valley .
until now , many local residents have supported the construction of the highway because it could cut down on fatal traffic accidents in the area .
however , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted a recent polish survey showing that 67 percent are in favor of the longer , more costly route proposed by environmentalists that would bypass the nature preserves .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

but the bishops say they were expressing their shock . the israeli ambassador in berlin has said he was shocked and disappointed by comments from a german bishop in which the cleric compared the situation of the palestinians to jews in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii . " one can have differing opinions on israeli policies , one can criticize them , but it depends on the choice of words , the terms and the historical comparisons one uses , " said ambassador shimon stein in a statement . german media quoted the bishop of the southern city of eichstätt , gregor maria hanke , earlier this week as deploring the conditions imposed on palestinians in the occupied territories after a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
hanke was part of a group of 26 german roman catholic bishops traveling through israel for one week . " in the morning we saw photographs from the inhumane warsaw ghetto , in the evening we drove through the ghetto in ramallah , " hanke said .
" it is infuriating . " stein questioned hanke 's choice of words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish ghetto in warsaw was the largest set up by the nazis " when terms such as ' warsaw ghetto ' or ' racism ' are used in connection with israeli or palestinian policies , one has forgotten everything or never learned a thing and failed morally , " stein said . the german council of jews called hanke 's remarks " horrifying and utterly unacceptable . " " with friends like them , who needs enemies ? " said dieter graumann , the council 's vice-president , in wednesday 's edition of the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" anyone who compares the condition of the palestinians with the sufferings of the jews in the ghettoes under the nazis has learned nothing from history . " graumann called the remarks " anti-semitic in character . " bishop simply wanted to express his personal grief the german news agency dpa asked hanke if he had been correctly quoted . " i just wanted to express my personal grief , " hanke said .
he added that the immediate impression of the concrete barrier in the west bank had been shocking to him . " a comparison between the events of the holocaust and the contemporary situation in palestine is not acceptable and was not intended , " hanke told dpa . in 1940 , months after invading poland in september 1939 , the nazis forced some 500,000 jews into the warsaw ghetto , surrounding it with a high wall .
about 100,000 died inside from hunger and disease , and over 300,000 were sent to death camps .
the ghetto was destroyed in 1943 . " this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " cologne 's archbishop cardinal joachim meisner and other bishops were quoted as comparing israel 's controversial separation barrier to the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's separation barrier reminded some bishops of the berlin wall " i never thought i would have to see something like this ever again in my life , " meisner said according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" this wall will fall like the berlin wall before it . " stein said the bishops had " demonized " israel in the conflict and used double standards to attack its policies . " a fence or a wall built by people as a security measure can , when the political conditions change , be dismantled , " stein said .
" the victims of terrorists can not be brought back to life . " the conference of german catholic bishops has rejected stein 's remarks .
it said in a statement that cardinal karl lehmann , the conference chairman , had repeatedly endorsed israel 's right to exist and denounced terrorism against its people . the conference secretary , hans langendörfer , said the bishops ' few " very personal expressions of shock " had since been corrected by them in a self-critical fashion . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

" weekend trips by plane are out of bounds from a climate point of view , " she said .
" discount flights at cut-rate prices should be forbidden . " some 20 percent of germans have traveled on discount airlines and would also consider booking a low-cost flight , according to a tns infratest survey . environmental protection groups have called for an end to germany protecting jet fuel from taxes , a step german economics minster michael glos rejected . " what 's the sense of one airline paying a fuel tax and its competition flying the same route without added costs ? " he asked , insisting on an international response to climate protection . balance between economy and environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plane contrails and cirrus cloud effects were not accounted for in global warming estimates glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

polish and german politicians were taken aback . the speaker of the polish parliament marek jurek has called on germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to reprimand erika steinbach , a cdu parliamentarian and head of the german league of expellees . steinbach had told the daily passauer neue presse that the ruling polish coalition , led by the conservative law and justice party , had no interest in reconciliation . " the parties that govern poland are comparable to the german republicans , dvu and npd , " the paper quoted steinbach as saying in its tuesday edition .
she was referring to germany 's most prominent far-right parties .
the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which has been compared to hitler 's national socialists , has said it wants germany 's borders redrawn along pre-world war ii lines .
a number of npd web sites have also claimed poland was to blame for the outbreak of the war . " all the gestures from chancellor angela merkel towards warsaw have apparently gone unnoticed there , " steinbach said . steinbach 's remarks came as leaders from germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and its polish counterpart , the sejm , met in berlin on tuesday .
after the meeting , jurek said steinbach 's comment was " not an appropriate statement . " " i hope there will be an end to these kinds of comments in the future and that steinbach 's party colleagues will respond to such remarks more forcefully , " jurek said . steinbach 's remarks could aggravate strained relations between the two neighbors ahead of a crucial meeting .
merkel is due to travel to poland in mid-march to try to win support for her drive to re-launch the european constitution . cdu distances itself from steinbach steinbach received unexpected support from opposition green politician volker beck . beck , parliamentary secretary of the green party , said steinbach 's remarks held true for some polish parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's leaders are identical twins " in my opinion , the league of polish families , which supplies the culture minister , has neo-nazi traits , " beck told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . beck said law and justice - the party founded by polish president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - was a mix of the right wing of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and right-wing extremists . steinbach 's party distanced itself from her remarks . cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said they " did not correspond with the german cdu 's opinion . " markus meckel , a lawmaker with the cdu 's coalition partner , the center-left social democrats , called steinbach 's remarks " outrageous . " " erika steinbach should apologize immediately to the polish government , " meckel said in a statement . a sensitive bilateral issue steinbach is well-known - and unpopular - in poland for her efforts to build a memorial center in berlin for german wartime expellees .
many poles who recall the brutal nazi occupation of their country during world war ii are suspicious of her efforts to draw attention to the plight of expelled germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displaced headed west by any means towards the end of the war some 14 million german nationals were displaced , deported or expelled from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 onwards as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's third reich crumbled . the case of germans expelled from formerly occupied polish territory or regions transferred to poland after germany 's defeat has posed diplomatic problems for the countries for years .
but it has been a particular bone of contention since the conservatives came to power in poland in 2005 . merkel , in line with all postwar german governments , has attempted to remain as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head-on with the large numbers of affected germans or with the poles . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines vintners toast german wine 's popularity news -pipe- 07.03.2007 at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good wine can certainly facilitate some tough summit talks there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits . chancellor angela merkel had her work cut out for her when germany took over the rotating eu and g8 presidencies in january .
breathing new life into the nearly dead european constitution , reviving international efforts for peace in the middle east or battling climate change - all are top items on germany 's agenda . but merkel does n't just face political challenges .
she is , of course , also responsible for being the perfect host at the upcoming eu and g8 summits . and with france 's connoisseur president jacques chirac at the table , merkel is n't taking any chances . according to wine industry officials , the chancellor has handpicked just which nectar of the gods will be served during dinner . finding the right red wine for chirac 's palate germany , of course , has nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to wine . germany leads the world in production of the white wine riesling , which has enjoyed a global renaissance over the past decade , said michael prince zu salm-salm , president of the vdp , an elite group of top german wine producers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit wine comes from the vineyards of eberbach monastery but merkel 's protocol office was stumped when it came to the red wine and contacted the prince for assistance .
after all , there are fewer growers of world-class red wines in germany and prince zu salm-salm said merkel was concerned about serving a wine that would measure up to chirac 's standards . merkel is right to be worried about the gastronomically outspoken french president .
two years ago , chirac slammed finnish food as the worst in europe followed by that of britain . " one ca n't trust people who have a cuisine that bad , " chirac was quoted as saying in reference to british cooking . that stinging criticism did little for france 's relations with either country and merkel clearly wants to prevent any such outbursts from overshadowing the summits she is hosting . merkel has chosen " hell 's mountain " to drink so what can political leaders expect in their glasses ?
after the vdp sent over samples of 12 leading red wines to the chancellery , merkel chose a 2003 " assmannshausen höllenberg spätburgunder , " a pinot noir from the rheingau region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to play the perfect host it will be served at the eu summits in brussels this week and in berlin on march 25 as well as at at the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june . although its name literally translates as " hell 's mountain , " it 's actually a corruption of the german word halden , which describes the steep vineyards where the grapes are grown . nonetheless , it should certainly liven up merkel 's meetings .

the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa . " we need to take bolder steps towards a european energy market , " e.on chief executive officer wulf bernotat said at his company 's annual press conference in düsseldorf . bernotat said he had proposed a european core market in the energy sector , linking austria , france , germany , switzerland and the benelux countries - the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . bernotat said e.on would be holding discussions on the plan with the eu commission , calling it more favorable than an eu proposal to separate electricity and natural gas suppliers from their networks . double-digit growth sparked by higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu to discuss alternatives to traditional power supply on thursday higher prices paid by consumers for electricity and natural gas helped e.on achieve double-digit growth in 2006 , with sales up 21 percent from 2005 to 67.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 88.8 billion -rrb- , the company said . e.on said adjusted net income rose 20 percent to 4.4 billion euros , but the unadjusted figure was down 32 percent at 5.1 billion euros in comparison to last year , when the sale of property concern viterra and ruhrgas industries boosted e.on 's earnings . the company said the good results meant it would increase the dividend for shareholders by 60 euro cents to 3.35 euros .
e.on share prices were up 1.39 percent at 98.06 euros after the news . it also said five regional e.on suppliers would lower prices for consumers by up to 8.4 percent in may or june ; two had already done so this month . push for endesa bernotat said his company was still pressing ahead with its 41-billion-euros takeover bid for spain 's top electricity supplier endesa , despite a threat from italian rival enel which has acquired a 22 percent stake in the spanish company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle goes on on tuesday , e.on dropped a demand that endesa 's shareholders change company regulations to ease the takeover , a move that analysts said may result in enel and other large endesa investors being unable to form a voting majority . bernotat said a takeover by e.on would accelerate moves towards a fusion of the european energy market , which is currently operated on a regional basis . enel 's acquisition of a 22-percent stake in endesa has turned it into the company 's main shareholder .
others include the spanish builder acciona , which holds 21.3 per cent , and sepi with 2.9 percent . the german group said it would seek to establish contact with enel to discuss its intentions with regard to endesa . bernotat has not ruled out that e.on might content itself with a minority stake . european commission involvement the european commission earlier blocked attempts by madrid to impose strict conditions on e.on in a bid to keep endesa in spanish hands . endesa shareholders had been scheduled to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on march 20 .
but the spanish firm has called off the meeting in the wake of e.on 's latest announcement . meanwhile , european union regulators stepped up their threat of legal action against spain on wednesday , formally requesting madrid to withdraw key conditions on e.on bid to buy endesa . the european commission said it asked spain to reply by march 16 or face a possible legal battle at the eu 's high court in luxembourg . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy company ups spanish takeover bid germany 's e.on has sweetened its offer for endesa by more than 12 percent , valuing the spanish electricity utility at 41 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .

the opinion poll was conducted by polling firm nop about two weeks ahead of a report by sir michael lyons on the future of taxation .
property bands are currently based on the value of properties 16 years ago , and fail to take into account sharp increases in property prices or home improvements adding value . "
it is clear no form of taxation will ever win a popularity contest " phil woolas , local government minister half said they would support a revaluation of their home while 44 % were opposed .
the survey showed 41 % of respondents thought that revaluation would mean their house moved to a higher band .
two-thirds also supported the idea of adding extra bands at the top and bottom of the current scale , meaning the most expensive properties would pay more , and the cheapest , less .
responding to the survey , local government minister phil woolas said : " it is clear no form of taxation will ever win a popularity contest but i welcome these findings as a contribution to the debate on council tax , which is not helped by almost daily scaremongering and peddling of myths .
" we take the view that it is the increase in the council tax rather than the tax itself which is controversial .
that is why we have used our capping powers to protect the taxpayer .
" virtually all developed countries have a property tax which is widely recognised as the right way of paying for a proportion of the services that local people use , and there is a strong economic case for retaining a local property tax . "

the assembly audit committee said the trust has failed to deliver acceptable standards of emergency response times .
it said south east wales was hit particularly badly , with management failings and not lack of money blamed .
the ambulance trust said the report gave " cause for optimism " and was a " vote of confidence " in new management .
performance was significantly worse than in england , and this was due to inefficiency and not a shortage of staff or finance , said ams .
according to the report , the reasons for the ambulance trust 's failure were many and varied but were caused by weaknesses in all areas of management practice and not by a lack of resources .
the trust has had considerable resources at its disposal but has been inefficient in the way it has used them janet davies am , audit committee chair problems with the trust included inadequate leadership , a confused internal structure and poor use of financial resources .
however , the committee also found that there were grounds for optimism that that these problems could be resolved over time provided key challenges were met .
committee chair , janet davies am , said the problems pre-dated present chief alan murray adding she believed improvements were taking place .
she said : " the management failings which led to the poor performance of the ambulance service were completely unacceptable and should be a salutary lesson to other public sector organisations in wales and beyond . "
she said that the committee was " shocked by the scale of the failings " .
ms davies added : " the trust has had considerable resources at its disposal but has been inefficient in the way it has used them .
" we did find grounds for optimism that the service can be improved under the new team led by alan murray , but only if these key shortcomings are addressed . "
health minister dr brian gibbons launches the new ambulance fleet the trust has been beset by problems , with two changes in the post of chief executive over the last 10 months and ams voting for a public inquiry .
the welsh ambulance service nhs trust said the report echoed findings of earlier reports by the auditor general and healthcare inspectorate wales .
it said it also pointed to optimism and said it was " another vote of confidence in its new leadership " .
chief executive alan murray said : " we did not wait for those reports to be published before we started making improvements and we are already addressing all the major issues raised . "
he said it was a " three-to-five-year project " but that immediate improvements were being made .
mr murray added his role was the " toughest job " he had been involved in .
emergency calls last week , the trust announced an improvement in is response times .
its quarterly figures to december showed a 1.3 % improvement across wales in ambulances reaching emergency calls within the target time of eight minutes .
only north wales -lrb- 62.9 % -rrb- passed the 60 % target , with an all-wales average of 54.2 % of calls being met within eight minutes .
the busiest region , south east wales achieved 49.2 % but the trust said locally , cardiff , merthyr and newport were now hitting the 60 % target .

researchers found that in areas of the alps heavily used for sports , black grouse produced large amounts of a hormone indicating stress .
writing in the royal society 's journal proceedings b , they say these sports represent a new threat to wildlife .
climatic change is also affecting habitat for these birds .
during the winter , they make burrows , or " igloos " , in the snow .
they come out twice each day to feed , then make a new igloo in which to hide .
rising winter temperatures are reducing the availability of these hiding places on lower slopes , while this new study , by scientists based in switzerland and austria , suggests the growing popularity of " extreme " winter sports is affecting their chances higher up the slopes .
under pressure in a wide variety of animals , production of the hormone corticosterone rises in conditions of stress .
black grouse are apparently no different .
in the first part of their study , the research team tagged three of the birds for identification .
they then put them under stress for several days by repeatedly forcing them out of their snow burrows , mimicking conditions the birds face in areas heavily used for human recreation .
signs of stress were evident in the birds ' faeces in the form of elevated levels of corticosterone .
the second part of the study involved collecting black grouse faeces left in 32 sites , some close to winter sports centres and others in unused parts of the mountains .
birds closer to human sites produced higher levels of corticosterone , the stress marker .
stress can affect animals in a variety of ways , potentially affecting even reproduction , though this study did not look for or find any specific impacts of the elevated stress .
but there may be other factors too .
increased disturbance may mean birds leaving their igloos more frequently , exposing them to cold and predation .
more research would be needed to measure these impacts and to extend the analysis to other species .
looking at other regions used for winter sports would be another approach .
but the research team , led by raphael arlettaz from the university of bern , believes alpine wildlife might need extra protection as winter sports and winter melting spread .
" only the creation of suitable protected wintering refuges will enable the alpine fauna to endure the growing pressure exerted by human activities on these vulnerable mountain ecosystems , " the scientists write .

researchers found that in areas of the alps heavily used for sports , black grouse produced large amounts of a hormone indicating stress .
writing in the royal society 's journal proceedings b , they say these sports represent a new threat to wildlife .
climatic change is also affecting habitat for these birds .
during the winter , they make burrows , or " igloos " , in the snow .
they come out twice each day to feed , then make a new igloo in which to hide .
rising winter temperatures are reducing the availability of these hiding places on lower slopes , while this new study , by scientists based in switzerland and austria , suggests the growing popularity of " extreme " winter sports is affecting their chances higher up the slopes .
under pressure in a wide variety of animals , production of the hormone corticosterone rises in conditions of stress .
black grouse are apparently no different .
in the first part of their study , the research team tagged three of the birds for identification .
they then put them under stress for several days by repeatedly forcing them out of their snow burrows , mimicking conditions the birds face in areas heavily used for human recreation .
" extreme " sports are taking people into more remote parts of the alps signs of stress were evident in the birds ' faeces in the form of elevated levels of corticosterone .
the second part of the study involved collecting black grouse faeces left in 32 sites , some close to winter sports centres and others in unused parts of the mountains .
birds closer to human sites produced higher levels of corticosterone , the stress marker .
stress can affect animals in a variety of ways , potentially affecting even reproduction , though this study did not look for or find any specific impacts of the elevated stress .
but there may be other factors too .
increased disturbance may mean birds leaving their igloos more frequently , exposing them to cold and predation .
more research would be needed to measure these impacts and to extend the analysis to other species .

the move follows a decision by a group of top consultants to boycott the process .
the consultants , from the west midlands , said they would not interview any candidates , claiming the system was flawed and unfair .
the british medical association said the current round of interviews should be suspended .
not only is this response , too late , it also does not go far enough dr jo hilborne bma junior doctors committee the department of health refused this request - but did agree to a review .
it will be completed by the end of march , so that any changes deemed necessary can be put in place before a second round of recruitment begins in late april .
this will allow doctors not granted an interview in the current round a second chance .
doctors ' training was revamped in 2005 , with the aim of speeding up progress so juniors could reach consultant level in an average of 11 years , rather than the current 14 .
however , doctors who have been through their initial stage of training under both the old and the new systems are all competing for a limited number of specialist training posts this year .
as a result the bma says over 28,000 uk doctors are currently competing for 22,000 posts .
badly organised the bma said the new system set up to process applications was badly organised , failed to draw out applicants ' expertise and could not cope with demand .
it said there was growing evidence that able doctors had not been offered any interviews .
it also claimed that non-medically qualified staff were involved in the recruitment process , while consultants had insufficient time to shortlist applicants fairly .
a computer system set up to deal with the recruitment process crashed after being overwhelmed by the number of applications .
the west midlands consultants had been due to select candidates to work in general surgery .
in a statement they objected to the fact that a longlist of candidates had not been drawn up prior to the selection panel , and said the new system had been rushed in to meet an unrealistic deadline .
they said : " we owe it to our patients and the profession that we are able to select and appoint the best candidates to surgical training posts and felt strongly that this was impossible today . "
they said the decision had been explained to the candidates , who were supportive .
warning letter meanwhile , the bma wrote to health secretary patricia hewitt , warning the continued failure of the government to act could have disastrous consequences for both doctors and patients .
dr jo hilborne , chairman of the bma junior doctors committee , welcomed the review .
but she said : " not only is this response , too late , it also does not go far enough .
" the only fair solution now is for the interview process to be suspended until it can be clearly shown that no doctor has been disadvantaged as a result of the government 's mistakes . "
lord hunt , the health minister , denied doctors had been unfairly treated , and said many would have another chance to apply successfully .
" this system was designed with a huge input from doctors themselves .
it did emphasise practical skills and competencies .
" let me assure you that in the first round of appointments , only the candidates of very good quality will be appointed .
" there is then to be a second round starting in april , and there will be many more places , many more people will be shortlisted , and the second round will of course be informed by the review which is going led to be the medical royal colleges . "
andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , said : " the government has waited until thousands of junior doctors were in despair about their career before they understood the need for action .
" they have badly mishandled the recruitment process . "

badly organised the bma said the new system set up to process applications was badly organised , failed to draw out applicants ' expertise and could not cope with demand .
it said there was growing evidence that able doctors had not been offered any interviews .
it also claimed that non-medically qualified staff were involved in the recruitment process , while consultants had insufficient time to shortlist applicants fairly .
a computer system set up to deal with the recruitment process crashed after being overwhelmed by the number of applications .
the west midlands consultants had been due to select candidates to work in general surgery .
in a statement they objected to the fact that a longlist of candidates had not been drawn up prior to the selection panel , and said the new system had been rushed in to meet an unrealistic deadline .
they said : " we owe it to our patients and the profession that we are able to select and appoint the best candidates to surgical training posts and felt strongly that this was impossible today . "
they said the decision had been explained to the candidates , who were supportive .
warning letter meanwhile , the bma wrote to health secretary patricia hewitt , warning the continued failure of the government to act could have disastrous consequences for both doctors and patients .
dr jo hilborne , chairman of the bma junior doctors committee , welcomed the review .
but she said : " not only is this response , too late , it also does not go far enough .
" the only fair solution now is for the interview process to be suspended until it can be clearly shown that no doctor has been disadvantaged as a result of the government 's mistakes . "
lord hunt , the health minister , denied doctors had been unfairly treated , and said many would have another chance to apply successfully .
" this system was designed with a huge input from doctors themselves .
it did emphasise practical skills and competencies .
" let me assure you that in the first round of appointments , only the candidates of very good quality will be appointed .
" there is then to be a second round starting in april , and there will be many more places , many more people will be shortlisted , and the second round will of course be informed by the review which is going led to be the medical royal colleges . "
andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , said : " the government has waited until thousands of junior doctors were in despair about their career before they understood the need for action .
" they have badly mishandled the recruitment process . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- google helps terabyte data swaps home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 7 march 2007 , 10:19 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version google helps terabyte data swaps darren waters technology editor , bbc news website , san francisco the project was inspired by work on the archimedes palimpsest google is developing a program to help academics around the world exchange huge amounts of data .
the firm 's open source team is working on ways to physically transfer huge data sets up to 120 terabytes in size .
" we have started collecting these data sets and shipping them out to other scientists who want them , " said google 's chris dibona .
google sends scientists a hard drive system and then copies it before passing it on to other researchers .
data delays it hopes that one day the data it helps to swap will be available to the public .
mr dibona , open source program manager at google , said the team was inspired by work done by microsoft researcher jim gray , who delivered copies of the terraserver mapping data to people around the world .
the one terabyte of image data in the set was too large to send over a computer network .
" i wished people were doing that for biology , genetic research and antiquities research , " said mr dibona .
the team was spurred into action after speaking to the research group re-constructing the archimedes palimpsest , a medieval parchment manuscript containing seven treatises by the greek scientist .
because the parchment had been over-written several times by different authors , scientists have been reconstructing the original work by uncovering the layers using advanced imaging techniques .
dibona : networks are not big enough to ship terabytes of data said mr dibona : " the palimpsest group had been creating enormous data sets but had this problem - how to get it from place to place .
" the networks are n't basically big enough and you do n't want to ship the data in this manner , you want to ship it fast .
" you want to ship it sometimes on a hard drive .
what if you have these huge data sets - 120 terabytes - how do you get them from point a to point b for these scientists ? "
google has worked with the archimedes group - and subsequent institutions - to give them a hard drive recording system .
" we have a number of machines about the size of brick blocks , filled with hard drives .
" we send them out to people who copy the data on them and ship them back to us .
we dump them on to one of our data systems and ship it out to people . "
google keeps a copy and the data is always in an open format , or in the public domain or perhaps covered by a creative commons license .
the program is currently informal and not open to the general public .
google either approaches bodies that it knows has large data sets or is contacted by scientists themselves .
one of the largest data sets copied and distributed was data from the hubble telescope - 120 terabytes of data .
one terabyte is equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes .
mr dibona said he hoped that google could one day make the data available to the public .
" we have got those systems in development but we are not yet ready to launch to the public .
in the mean time we are useful and we need to do this for more groups . "
mr dibona 's team has the job of helping the development of open source projects around the world as well as building internal projects .
" my mission is also to release a lot of code and we 've released over a million lines of open source code between web tool kits and other things . "
code curriculum google also helps by offering funding to open source projects around the world and by offering engineering time .
more than $ 1.5m was spent last year in donations to projects , said mr dibona .
it also runs a program to place student developers with open source teams , called the summer of code .
google ships out hard drives to hold the huge amounts of data now in its third year , more than a 1,000 students from 90 countries have worked on hundreds of different projects .
" the founders of google are passionate about open source .
they see google as a net beneficiary of open source technology .
" they want to make sure that these people whose software we use everyday remain vital . "
google 's infrastructure relies on a lot of open source software , including using a version of linux as the desktop operating system for developers .
" a lot of googlers come out of this community - we are open source people . "
some have questioned why google has not done even more - such as releasing an open source operating system or opening up more of its software to the open source community .
mr dibona , who is a long-standing linux evangelist , said : " i am comfortable with where google is operating .
people are often upset and feel we should be releasing more .
" and i agree ; i would love to release more .
it 's more a function of engineering time , than it is a function of desire . "

the firm 's open source team is working on ways to physically transfer huge data sets up to 120 terabytes in size .
" we have started collecting these data sets and shipping them out to other scientists who want them , " said google 's chris dibona .
google sends scientists a hard drive system and then copies it before passing it on to other researchers .
data delays it hopes that one day the data it helps to swap will be available to the public .
mr dibona , open source program manager at google , said the team was inspired by work done by microsoft researcher jim gray , who delivered copies of the terraserver mapping data to people around the world .
the one terabyte of image data in the set was too large to send over a computer network .
" i wished people were doing that for biology , genetic research and antiquities research , " said mr dibona .
the team was spurred into action after speaking to the research group re-constructing the archimedes palimpsest , a medieval parchment manuscript containing seven treatises by the greek scientist .
because the parchment had been over-written several times by different authors , scientists have been reconstructing the original work by uncovering the layers using advanced imaging techniques .
dibona : networks are not big enough to ship terabytes of data said mr dibona : " the palimpsest group had been creating enormous data sets but had this problem - how to get it from place to place .
" the networks are n't basically big enough and you do n't want to ship the data in this manner , you want to ship it fast .
" you want to ship it sometimes on a hard drive .
what if you have these huge data sets - 120 terabytes - how do you get them from point a to point b for these scientists ? "
google has worked with the archimedes group - and subsequent institutions - to give them a hard drive recording system .
" we have a number of machines about the size of brick blocks , filled with hard drives .
" we send them out to people who copy the data on them and ship them back to us .
we dump them on to one of our data systems and ship it out to people . "
google keeps a copy and the data is always in an open format , or in the public domain or perhaps covered by a creative commons license .
the program is currently informal and not open to the general public .
google either approaches bodies that it knows has large data sets or is contacted by scientists themselves .
one of the largest data sets copied and distributed was data from the hubble telescope - 120 terabytes of data .
one terabyte is equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes .
mr dibona said he hoped that google could one day make the data available to the public .
" we have got those systems in development but we are not yet ready to launch to the public .
in the mean time we are useful and we need to do this for more groups . "
mr dibona 's team has the job of helping the development of open source projects around the world as well as building internal projects .
" my mission is also to release a lot of code and we 've released over a million lines of open source code between web tool kits and other things . "
code curriculum google also helps by offering funding to open source projects around the world and by offering engineering time .
more than $ 1.5m was spent last year in donations to projects , said mr dibona .
it also runs a program to place student developers with open source teams , called the summer of code .
google ships out hard drives to hold the huge amounts of data now in its third year , more than a 1,000 students from 90 countries have worked on hundreds of different projects .
" the founders of google are passionate about open source .
they see google as a net beneficiary of open source technology .
" they want to make sure that these people whose software we use everyday remain vital . "
google 's infrastructure relies on a lot of open source software , including using a version of linux as the desktop operating system for developers .
" a lot of googlers come out of this community - we are open source people . "
some have questioned why google has not done even more - such as releasing an open source operating system or opening up more of its software to the open source community .
mr dibona , who is a long-standing linux evangelist , said : " i am comfortable with where google is operating .
people are often upset and feel we should be releasing more .
" and i agree ; i would love to release more .
it 's more a function of engineering time , than it is a function of desire . "

mr dibona , who is a long-standing linux evangelist , said : " i am comfortable with where google is operating .
people are often upset and feel we should be releasing more .

the firm 's open source team is working on ways to physically transfer huge data sets up to 120 terabytes in size .
" we have started collecting these data sets and shipping them out to other scientists who want them , " said google 's chris dibona .
google sends scientists a hard drive system and then copies it before passing it on to other researchers .
data delays it hopes that one day the data it helps to swap will be available to the public .
mr dibona , open source program manager at google , said the team was inspired by work done by microsoft researcher jim gray , who delivered copies of the terraserver mapping data to people around the world .
the one terabyte of image data in the set was too large to send over a computer network .
" i wished people were doing that for biology , genetic research and antiquities research , " said mr dibona .
the team was spurred into action after speaking to the research group re-constructing the archimedes palimpsest , a medieval parchment manuscript containing seven treatises by the greek scientist .
because the parchment had been over-written several times by different authors , scientists have been reconstructing the original work by uncovering the layers using advanced imaging techniques .
dibona : networks are not big enough to ship terabytes of data said mr dibona : " the palimpsest group had been creating enormous data sets but had this problem - how to get it from place to place .
" the networks are n't basically big enough and you do n't want to ship the data in this manner , you want to ship it fast .
" you want to ship it sometimes on a hard drive .
what if you have these huge data sets - 120 terabytes - how do you get them from point a to point b for these scientists ? "
google has worked with the archimedes group - and subsequent institutions - to give them a hard drive recording system .
" we have a number of machines about the size of brick blocks , filled with hard drives .
" we send them out to people who copy the data on them and ship them back to us .
we dump them on to one of our data systems and ship it out to people . "
google keeps a copy and the data is always in an open format , or in the public domain or perhaps covered by a creative commons license .
the program is currently informal and not open to the general public .
google either approaches bodies that it knows has large data sets or is contacted by scientists themselves .
one of the largest data sets copied and distributed was data from the hubble telescope - 120 terabytes of data .
one terabyte is equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes .
mr dibona said he hoped that google could one day make the data available to the public .
" we have got those systems in development but we are not yet ready to launch to the public .
in the mean time we are useful and we need to do this for more groups . "
mr dibona 's team has the job of helping the development of open source projects around the world as well as building internal projects .
" my mission is also to release a lot of code and we 've released over a million lines of open source code between web tool kits and other things . "
code curriculum google also helps by offering funding to open source projects around the world and by offering engineering time .
more than $ 1.5m was spent last year in donations to projects , said mr dibona .
it also runs a program to place student developers with open source teams , called the summer of code .
google ships out hard drives to hold the huge amounts of data now in its third year , more than a 1,000 students from 90 countries have worked on hundreds of different projects .
" the founders of google are passionate about open source .
they see google as a net beneficiary of open source technology .
" they want to make sure that these people whose software we use everyday remain vital . "
google 's infrastructure relies on a lot of open source software , including using a version of linux as the desktop operating system for developers .

they see google as a net beneficiary of open source technology .
" they want to make sure that these people whose software we use everyday remain vital . "
google 's infrastructure relies on a lot of open source software , including using a version of linux as the desktop operating system for developers .
" a lot of googlers come out of this community - we are open source people . "
some have questioned why google has not done even more - such as releasing an open source operating system or opening up more of its software to the open source community .
mr dibona , who is a long-standing linux evangelist , said : " i am comfortable with where google is operating .
people are often upset and feel we should be releasing more .
" and i agree ; i would love to release more .
it 's more a function of engineering time , than it is a function of desire . "

construction work is due to begin in march on the new uk supreme court , following a blueprint designed by a team of top british architects .
the plan is for the new court to emerge , like a £ 30m butterfly , from the chrysalis that is middlesex guildhall crown court .
built in 1913 , the grade ii * building , which sits unnoticed and largely unloved on one side of westminster 's parliament square , presents a neo-gothic edifice .
it was , until 1965 , home to the now defunct middlesex county council .
the site 's new role is wrapped up with the government 's house of lords reform .
it is due to be transformed into a home fit for britain 's ultimate arbiters of justice , with its first case expected to be heard in the autumn of 2009 .
why do we need a uk supreme court ?
at present the outcome of criminal and civil cases can be appealed to the house of lords if a point of law needs clarifying .
that will be taken over by the supreme court and the country 's 12 top judges will be justices of the supreme court rather than law lords .
crucially , the justices will not have to be peers .
" -lsb- the law lords and their successors -rsb- are the cream of the crop , hugely learned and have survived very tough careers in the law to get where they are , " says brendan keith , house of lords judicial office .
in the us , the make-up of the supreme court is heavily partisan .
but lord lester qc , a liberal democrat peer and one of the supreme court 's most enthusiastic proponents , says a new appointments procedure will avoid the dangers of political influence .

save britain 's heritage has secured a judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission - a move that could delay the court .
david wilshire , a conservative mp who has taken a great interest in the plans , welcomes feilden and mawson 's plans .
the building works poorly as a modern court , he says .
lightwells , which originally brought natural light in , have since been filled in , making the building " dark and dank " .
the court is also one of only a handful in the country not to have a secure compound for prison vans , which must park in the street outside .
ancient name mr wilshire , whose spelthorne seat is one of 25 in what was once middlesex , only asks that the name not be airbrushed from history .
" middlesex , the kingdom of the middle saxons , has been around for 1,000 years and the guildhall symbolises that civic pride .
its place in history should be recognised and they should not touch the coat of arms or the war memorials of the middlesex regiment which are inside . "
architect hugh feilden , who leads the design team , says the lightwells would be restored and a cafe and exhibition centre will be added as part of a plan to encourage " open justice " .
" the building 's position on parliament square is quite symbolic , " he says " it represents the judiciary and on the other sides are the executive -lrb- the treasury -rrb- , parliament and faith -lrb- westminster abbey -rrb- . "
though he sympathises with save 's concerns , the " long-term benefits to the building far outweigh the damage done by removing the furniture . "

the rate for workers aged 18-21 will rise by 15p to £ 4.60 an hour , while workers aged 16 and 17 will get a 10p rise to £ 3.40 an hour .
the increases will affect 1.3 million workers and are in line with inflation .
unions said the government should have been " bolder " and increased the minimum wage by a rate above inflation for the eighth year in a row .
government ' proud ' the increases in the minimum wage were recommended by the government 's low pay commission and were accepted by the trade and industry secretary , alistair darling .
minimum wage levels from october workers aged 22 and over : £ 5.52 an hour workers aged 18 to 21 : £ 4.60 an hour workers aged 16 and 17 : £ 3.40 an hour however , mr darling rejected a recommendation that 21-year-olds should receive the full adult rate of £ 5.52 an hour , saying that such a move could damage their job prospects .
overall , mr darling said that the establishment of a minimum wage had been a major achievement .
" just 10 years ago home workers could be paid as little as 35p an hour , cleaners £ 1.30 an hour and security guards £ 2.25 an hour , which was bad for families and just plain wrong , " he said .
" i am proud of the minimum wage , proud of how it is helping families and proud of the role it plays in the modern economy we are delivering . "
competitiveness warning when the minimum wage was first introduced in 1999 the adult rate stood at £ 3.60 an hour , and it has risen at a rate above inflation every year until now .
there is still scope to continue raising the wages of the lowest paid compared to the rest of us without ill effects brendan barber , tuc general secretary the low pay commission said that the established pattern of above-inflation rises in the minimum wage would have to come to an end .
" there has been a small fall in the number of jobs in the low paying sectors for the first time since the introduction of the minimum wage , " said paul myners , chairman of the low pay commission .
" given these and other factors we concluded that a cautious approach to our recommended minimum wage upratings was advisable . "
employers have warned for a long time that above-inflation increases could damage business and employment prospects .
however , unions have called for a £ 6-an-hour minimum for adult workers .
" the low pay commission could have been bolder and kept the minimum wage rising faster than pay overall , " said brendan barber , general secretary of the tuc .
" there is still scope to continue raising the wages of the lowest paid compared to the rest of us without ill effects . "

nhs staff told researchers obese women need closer monitoring and special equipment , and have a higher risk of complications such as pre-eclampsia .
they also said additional abdominal fat can make it hard to feel and scan a developing baby properly .
the university of teesside researchers , who spoke to maternity staff , called for better education about the risks .
the researchers interviewed 33 heads of midwifery , midwives , obstetricians and other professionals from 16 maternity units in the north east of england for their research in bjog : international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology .
the bjog research is the first to look at the impact on the nhs of caring for pregnant women who are obese . "
to be told you 're partly responsible for the death of your child is absolutely devastating " maria thornton , whose son was stillborn weight linked to baby 's death they found the women needed more tests because of an increased risk of conditions such as pregnancy-related diabetes , high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia .
additional layers of abdominal fat make it hard to feel and scan a developing baby to check its size and heart-rate .
obese mothers-to-be also need specialist equipment , such as modified beds and wheelchairs .
and they are also more likely to require an emergency caesarean - and are at an increased risk of complications , such as wound infection and blood clots , after the surgery .
complications professor carolyn summerbell , head of the university of teesside 's centre for food , physical activity and obesity research , said : " we 're not trying to blame or stigmatise obese pregnant mothers and we would certainly not recommend that overweight mums-to-be go on crash diets . "
i do n't think women realise how big a risk factor being overweight is " professor philip steer , bjog " but our initial findings show reasons for concern with obese pregnant mothers , and there is a lack of weight management guidance and support readily available for them . "
the researchers said the practice of monitoring the height and weight of pregnant women , abandoned in the late 1980s , should be re-introduced , professor philip steer , editor-in-chief of bjog , told the bbc he had carried out a caesarean where it had taken two doctors to hold up a woman 's fat during the operation .
he said : " i do n't think women realise how big a risk factor being overweight is .
" but women are between five and 15 times more likely to suffer complications in pregnancy if they have a body mass index of over 30 .
" much forward planning and co-ordination is required and public education campaigns should focus on a healthy lifestyle agenda , starting in our primary schools .
" we need to nip this in the bud . "
semen quality a second , separate study , published in the journal human reproduction , found obese couples are three times more likely to have trouble conceiving - defined as when becoming pregnant takes more than a year - than those of normal weight .
danish researchers studied almost 48,000 couples between 1996 and 2002 .
if both partners were overweight , there was a 1.4 higher chance of a couple waiting more than a year to conceive .
it has been shown that being overweight or obese can affect semen quality in men and ovulation , conception and implantation in women .
