several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .

the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .

the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .

" the lack of clinics , poor equipment and insufficient doctors and nurses are among the main obstacles to access to basic health care in developing countries , " brown said in a statement .
" so the next challenge is to devise , organize and manage health care as a whole . " issues of infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the fight to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases are also likely to be topics of discussion , according to the british statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and brown will talk about expanding health care in the developing world under german leadership the group of eight highly industrialized countries agreed in june to coordinate action to improve health care in the developing world .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister 's office would not confirm the exact agenda whether or not the european union 's new reform treaty , which replaced the planned constitution that went down to defeat in 2004 , would be a matter for discussion , saying only that the leaders would discuss " key issues " facing both countries .
the pair may also touch on the middle east , iraq and afghanistan .
germany , which held the european union 's rotating presidency for the first half of the year , brokered the reform treaty deal at the 27-member bloc 's june summit .
calls for referendum grow the eu treaty remains a hot topic in largely euro-skeptic britain .
a survey published earlier this week showed that 82 percent of british voters - including 80 percent of labour voters - want a referendum on the treaty .
members of the conservative party and labor unions have also called for a public vote .
in britain there has been speculation since blair left downing street on whether brown would alter the country 's foreign policy and begin to distance london from its " special relationship " with washington .
merkel and brown last met when the newly elected prime minister visited berlin in his first foreign trip .
after the meeting , the pair is scheduled to attend the international friendly soccer match between their countries at the renovated wembley stadium . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .

that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "

the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .

in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence .

" i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .

all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .

" i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years .

influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .
" those behind the attacks and kidnappings want to sabotage our long-term engagement , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told weekly newspaper die zeit .
" that 's why we ca n't give in to them . "

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .
" the deciding factor is whether one moves closer on the important themes . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .

the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .

all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .

" dresdner bank is ending its activities with iran and in iran , " the financial daily quoted a bank spokesman as saying on wednesday .
by the end of 2006 , dresdner bank 's lending , which was already below 500 million euros -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- , had already fallen to under 100 million .
export finance guarantees will be maintained through to their expiration date , according to ftd . a growing number of european financial institutions , including germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank , have also scaled back on existing business or restricted their dealings in iran .
in july , deutsche bank closed all personal and business accounts in iran . us has tried to cut off business to iran for years for years , the us government , which has accused iran of supporting terrorism , has been trying to isolate the country and cut off international business there .
washington has also spearheaded a crackdown on trade and the un security council has imposed sanctions on iran in order to put pressure on tehran ’ s leaders for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program . germany is one of iran 's leading trade partners , but after germany 's major commercial banks scaled back business last year , exports dropped by 12 percent for the first half of 2006 compared to the same period the previous year . analysts say , however , that punitive measures against the state are unlikely to force tehran to bow to international pressure to halt uranian enrichment , and that sanctions will have a limited impact as long as the oil money keeps flowing . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "
proposals fall short of goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build more than 20 new coal-fired power plants also came under fire a spokesman for the environment ministry said the government 's plan set some of the world 's most ambitious climate protection goals .
" before the professional bean counters talk about everything that is not in the packet , i can only suggest they read everything that is in it , " the spokesman told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on tuesday .
german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

" the lack of clinics , poor equipment and insufficient doctors and nurses are among the main obstacles to access to basic health care in developing countries , " brown said in a statement .
" so the next challenge is to devise , organize and manage health care as a whole . " issues of infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the fight to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases are also likely to be topics of discussion , according to the british statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and brown will talk about expanding health care in the developing world under german leadership the group of eight highly industrialized countries agreed in june to coordinate action to improve health care in the developing world .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister 's office would not confirm the exact agenda whether or not the european union 's new reform treaty , which replaced the planned constitution that went down to defeat in 2004 , would be a matter for discussion , saying only that the leaders would discuss " key issues " facing both countries .
the pair may also touch on the middle east , iraq and afghanistan .
germany , which held the european union 's rotating presidency for the first half of the year , brokered the reform treaty deal at the 27-member bloc 's june summit .
calls for referendum grow the eu treaty remains a hot topic in largely euro-skeptic britain .
a survey published earlier this week showed that 82 percent of british voters - including 80 percent of labour voters - want a referendum on the treaty .
members of the conservative party and labor unions have also called for a public vote .
in britain there has been speculation since blair left downing street on whether brown would alter the country 's foreign policy and begin to distance london from its " special relationship " with washington .

" the lack of clinics , poor equipment and insufficient doctors and nurses are among the main obstacles to access to basic health care in developing countries , " brown said in a statement .
" so the next challenge is to devise , organize and manage health care as a whole . " issues of infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the fight to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases are also likely to be topics of discussion , according to the british statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and brown will talk about expanding health care in the developing world under german leadership the group of eight highly industrialized countries agreed in june to coordinate action to improve health care in the developing world .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister 's office would not confirm the exact agenda whether or not the european union 's new reform treaty , which replaced the planned constitution that went down to defeat in 2004 , would be a matter for discussion , saying only that the leaders would discuss " key issues " facing both countries .
the pair may also touch on the middle east , iraq and afghanistan .
germany , which held the european union 's rotating presidency for the first half of the year , brokered the reform treaty deal at the 27-member bloc 's june summit .
calls for referendum grow the eu treaty remains a hot topic in largely euro-skeptic britain .
a survey published earlier this week showed that 82 percent of british voters - including 80 percent of labour voters - want a referendum on the treaty .
members of the conservative party and labor unions have also called for a public vote .
in britain there has been speculation since blair left downing street on whether brown would alter the country 's foreign policy and begin to distance london from its " special relationship " with washington .

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .
" the deciding factor is whether one moves closer on the important themes . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .

the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years .

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .

they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 .

" the lack of clinics , poor equipment and insufficient doctors and nurses are among the main obstacles to access to basic health care in developing countries , " brown said in a statement .
" so the next challenge is to devise , organize and manage health care as a whole . " issues of infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the fight to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases are also likely to be topics of discussion , according to the british statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and brown will talk about expanding health care in the developing world under german leadership the group of eight highly industrialized countries agreed in june to coordinate action to improve health care in the developing world .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister 's office would not confirm the exact agenda whether or not the european union 's new reform treaty , which replaced the planned constitution that went down to defeat in 2004 , would be a matter for discussion , saying only that the leaders would discuss " key issues " facing both countries .
the pair may also touch on the middle east , iraq and afghanistan .
germany , which held the european union 's rotating presidency for the first half of the year , brokered the reform treaty deal at the 27-member bloc 's june summit .
calls for referendum grow the eu treaty remains a hot topic in largely euro-skeptic britain .
a survey published earlier this week showed that 82 percent of british voters - including 80 percent of labour voters - want a referendum on the treaty .
members of the conservative party and labor unions have also called for a public vote .
in britain there has been speculation since blair left downing street on whether brown would alter the country 's foreign policy and begin to distance london from its " special relationship " with washington .
merkel and brown last met when the newly elected prime minister visited berlin in his first foreign trip .
after the meeting , the pair is scheduled to attend the international friendly soccer match between their countries at the renovated wembley stadium . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one who has detonated the mine is a boy and has been arrested , " sayed ansari , spokesman for the intelligence service national directorate for security -lrb- nds -rrb- told the german dpa news agency .
" he was arrested by our national directorate of security forces two hours after the incident , " ansari said , adding that the boy , who was reported to be either 15 or 16 years old , was being interrogated and that the reason for the attack remained unclear .
the online version of the german newsmagazine der spiegel also reported tuesday that a young afghan had been arrested in connection with the bombing .
neither the german foreign office nor the federal criminal police , in which the three officers served , confirmed the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in berlin fear germans may become the targets of further violence western security officials told dpa they highly doubted the boy was responsible for causing the explosion that killed the three officers attached to the german embassy in kabul last wednesday .
taliban members said they were responsible for the attack , though the claim could not be independently confirmed .
influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .
" those behind the attacks and kidnappings want to sabotage our long-term engagement , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told weekly newspaper die zeit .
" that 's why we ca n't give in to them . "

the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "

the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ?

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .
the afghanistan question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's afghanistan missions are up for a vote another contentious issue between coalition members has been the german military 's involvement in the operation enduring freedom , part of the united states-led war on terror , and two other bundeswehr mandates for operations in afghanistan .
the social democrats will support extending the mandates for two of germany 's missions in afghanistan .
these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .
" the deciding factor is whether one moves closer on the important themes . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .

german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .
" the family ministry is overwhelmed . " excess of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70 police officers were engaged in breaking up the assailants the german government meanwhile has condemned sunday 's attack , in which eight indian men were pursued through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony by a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans . around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence . " volker kauder , head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , expressed shame and disappointment . " i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the lack of clinics , poor equipment and insufficient doctors and nurses are among the main obstacles to access to basic health care in developing countries , " brown said in a statement .
" so the next challenge is to devise , organize and manage health care as a whole . " issues of infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the fight to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases are also likely to be topics of discussion , according to the british statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and brown will talk about expanding health care in the developing world under german leadership the group of eight highly industrialized countries agreed in june to coordinate action to improve health care in the developing world .
a spokeswoman for the prime minister 's office would not confirm the exact agenda whether or not the european union 's new reform treaty , which replaced the planned constitution that went down to defeat in 2004 , would be a matter for discussion , saying only that the leaders would discuss " key issues " facing both countries .
the pair may also touch on the middle east , iraq and afghanistan .

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "

the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "
proposals fall short of goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build more than 20 new coal-fired power plants also came under fire a spokesman for the environment ministry said the government 's plan set some of the world 's most ambitious climate protection goals .
" before the professional bean counters talk about everything that is not in the packet , i can only suggest they read everything that is in it , " the spokesman told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on tuesday .
german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .

the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility .

in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .

afghanistan , a minimum wage for postal workers and a controversial high-speed train project in munich topped the agenda . germany 's shaky grand coalition presented a united front tuesday after a late-night meeting to discuss the government 's plan of action until the next general elections , currently scheduled for 2009 .
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said she was extremely satisfied with the meeting .
the coalition does n't merely plan to soldier on until elections , but wants to have " good and successful cooperation , " merkel said tuesday .
the reunion was attended by leaders of the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
minimum wage for postal workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing a minimum wage for postal employees the cdu and spd have expressed disagreement over a wide range of issues in recent months including counter-terrorism measures , family policy , tax reforms and calls for a minimum wage .
on tuesday , the coalition agreed to institute a minimum wage for postal workers .
the spd has fought to get a general minimum wage while the cdu wants to see wage protections limited to approximately a dozen industrial sectors .
deutsche post , whose monopoly on letter delivery ends in 2008 , had expressed concern that foreign companies would import labor at below-market wages .
deutsche post has said that 32,000 postal jobs are endangered because many other countries have not opened their markets to competition .

these include the some 3,000 soldiers that serve as part of a nato-led peacekeeping effort in the north of the country .
the second mandate call for six tornado fighter jets and several hundred staff to operate and maintain them to be deployed to afghanistan .
the jets fly reconnaissance missions in afghanistan .
both mandates expire in october .
but a third deployment is more controversial and the parties agreed to delay a vote on it to give the spd more time to discuss the matter .
it centers on german special forces who are involved in operation enduring freedom campaign .
several parliamentarians have threatened to vote against extending the mandate due to an increasing number of civilian casualties and concerns about the way the program is run .
the issue will be discussed at the spd party conference at the end of october , vice chancellor franz müntefering , a social democrat , said tuesday in berlin .
" there is an open and public discussion " among party members about germany 's role in afghanistan , müntefering said .
fast train to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast , but pricey it also seems that the german government will end its opposition to a high-speed transrapid train planned for munich .
the project is expected to cost 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion . -rrb-
the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 .
the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes . the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
the german-designed transrapid floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks .
leading politicians , after the meeting , said the talks were productive and that the coalition would survive the differences of opinion that occur within it .
" differences of opinion are part of a democracy , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the csu .

" the one who has detonated the mine is a boy and has been arrested , " sayed ansari , spokesman for the intelligence service national directorate for security -lrb- nds -rrb- told the german dpa news agency .
" he was arrested by our national directorate of security forces two hours after the incident , " ansari said , adding that the boy , who was reported to be either 15 or 16 years old , was being interrogated and that the reason for the attack remained unclear .
the online version of the german newsmagazine der spiegel also reported tuesday that a young afghan had been arrested in connection with the bombing .
neither the german foreign office nor the federal criminal police , in which the three officers served , confirmed the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in berlin fear germans may become the targets of further violence western security officials told dpa they highly doubted the boy was responsible for causing the explosion that killed the three officers attached to the german embassy in kabul last wednesday .
taliban members said they were responsible for the attack , though the claim could not be independently confirmed .
influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .
" those behind the attacks and kidnappings want to sabotage our long-term engagement , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told weekly newspaper die zeit .
" that 's why we ca n't give in to them . "

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "
proposals fall short of goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build more than 20 new coal-fired power plants also came under fire a spokesman for the environment ministry said the government 's plan set some of the world 's most ambitious climate protection goals .
" before the professional bean counters talk about everything that is not in the packet , i can only suggest they read everything that is in it , " the spokesman told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on tuesday .
german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

" dresdner bank is ending its activities with iran and in iran , " the financial daily quoted a bank spokesman as saying on wednesday .
by the end of 2006 , dresdner bank 's lending , which was already below 500 million euros -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- , had already fallen to under 100 million .
export finance guarantees will be maintained through to their expiration date , according to ftd . a growing number of european financial institutions , including germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank , have also scaled back on existing business or restricted their dealings in iran .
in july , deutsche bank closed all personal and business accounts in iran . us has tried to cut off business to iran for years for years , the us government , which has accused iran of supporting terrorism , has been trying to isolate the country and cut off international business there .
washington has also spearheaded a crackdown on trade and the un security council has imposed sanctions on iran in order to put pressure on tehran ’ s leaders for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program . germany is one of iran 's leading trade partners , but after germany 's major commercial banks scaled back business last year , exports dropped by 12 percent for the first half of 2006 compared to the same period the previous year . analysts say , however , that punitive measures against the state are unlikely to force tehran to bow to international pressure to halt uranian enrichment , and that sanctions will have a limited impact as long as the oil money keeps flowing . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .
" those behind the attacks and kidnappings want to sabotage our long-term engagement , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told weekly newspaper die zeit .

german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .
" the family ministry is overwhelmed . " excess of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70 police officers were engaged in breaking up the assailants the german government meanwhile has condemned sunday 's attack , in which eight indian men were pursued through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony by a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans . around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence . " volker kauder , head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , expressed shame and disappointment . " i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "
proposals fall short of goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build more than 20 new coal-fired power plants also came under fire a spokesman for the environment ministry said the government 's plan set some of the world 's most ambitious climate protection goals .
" before the professional bean counters talk about everything that is not in the packet , i can only suggest they read everything that is in it , " the spokesman told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on tuesday .
german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "
complete data available in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files in bad arolsen are in a variety of sizes , forms and writing styles the two institutions received some 12 million digitized documents , about one-third of the bad arolsen archive .
the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .
prisoner-of-war data is kept separately by the central tracing agency in geneva , switzerland . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .
" the family ministry is overwhelmed . " excess of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70 police officers were engaged in breaking up the assailants the german government meanwhile has condemned sunday 's attack , in which eight indian men were pursued through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony by a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans . around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence . " volker kauder , head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , expressed shame and disappointment . " i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.08.2007 england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal of contention during the 1966 world cup final at wembley stadium the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades . for english soccer fans too young to remember the country 's finest soccer moment - lifting the world cup in 1966 - the past 41 years without a trophy have provided few reasons to become truly cheerful . without a world cup or european championship title to celebrate since the ' 66 win in front of a home crowd , england fans take solace in certain defining matches that punctuate the darkness of failure like stars in a gloomy night .
and none of those stars shines brighter than victories over one old foe in particular : germany . classic european duels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. high and wide english memories of the bad-tempered 1-0 win in euro 2000 and the 5-1 demolition job in munich in 2001 can sometimes be enough to raise a weary english fan 's spirits .
but reminiscing about germany can also lead to some of the darkest parts of the english soccer psyche .
that spot in the semi-conscience that is dominated by visions of england players firing penalties high and wide and a cup landing in the hands of lothar matthäus or jürgen klinsmann . the pleasure and pain of recollection go hand in hand .
such is the common soccer history and emotionally charged relationship between england and germany . as the two international rivals face off against each other again at the new wembley stadium for the first time in nearly six years , soccer fans are presented with one of the game 's biggest spectacles .
while both sides in wednesday 's friendly will be well below full strength due to injuries , england versus germany remains one of the sport 's classic matches and a duel between two of soccer 's greatest rivals . envy fuels english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's greatest moment : beating germany for the 1966 world cup title " for the english , the main cause for the rivalry comes from the combination of germany 's success in world cup competitions and england losing its competitive edge over germany from the 1970 's onwards , " jeff hill of the international center for sport history at de montfort university told dw-world.de.
" there was n't much rivalry before 1966 and not much during the world cup of that year until the final . " england won that final but have suffered at the feet of germany in the most important tournament matches between the two countries since .
for the english , a world cup semi-final defeat in 1990 and a european championship semi-final loss on home soil six years later are the most prominent scars from modern skirmishes between the two nations . so is it revenge that drives england into a frenzy whenever germany appears on the match schedule ? " there is a certain amount of envy involved , " said hill , alluding to germany 's more successful record .
" the english also seem to think that national pride is at stake , that the germans must be beaten at all costs .
whereas the traditional rivalry with scotland has waned as they 've become less of a force , germany has replaced the scots in the english mind . " ' a good game to win ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an english soccer fan 's reoccurring nightmare and what about germany ?
are the germans still motivated by a desire to avenge the controversial wembley goal that may or may not have crossed the line to send england onto victory in 1966 ? " i think the rivalry is a little one-sided , " said raphael honigstein , the european soccer correspondent for germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" for the germans it is a classic game and always a good one to win but the big grudge match is always against the dutch . " honigstein said he believes that , for germany , the 1966 final is now nothing more than a nostalgic talking point with few negative connotations .
he said the germans look at the game as just one of the clashes between the two countries which altered sporting history , rather than a touchstone for some epic rivalry . " the germans are aware of the english perception of a great rivalry ; they respect england , but prepare for the game in much the same way as , say , a match against the italians , " he said . england a benchmark for german teams still , there is a particular sense of nostalgia exists among german soccer fans when their country takes the field against england because the matches have nearly always served the germans as a barometer of their abilities , honigstein said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated england in the 1990 semi-final " the germans have always used games against the english to test out how good their current side is , " he said .
" when west germany came to wembley in 1972 and won 3-1 , it was a turning point for that side .
they went on to win that year 's european championship and then the world cup in 1974 . " with key players missing on both teams , honigstein said it will be difficult to tell if wednesday 's match will serve as a bellwether for german coach joachim löw 's goal of winning the 2008 european championships in switzerland and austria . focus falls on sport even without many of the stars making the trip to london , the germans ' arrival is an event the english football association is using to thank their guests for the hospitality offered to england fans at last year 's world cup . a huge banner saying " danke für 2006 " will be unfurled not only be a gesture of gratitude but also a statement on how far relations between the two sets of fans have come in recent years . " it used to all be about the war , " honigstein said .
" world war ii was a defining moment for england as a nation and germany was the defeated enemy .
generations grew up with stories of heroic brits and evil germans and this was reflected in the fan culture for many years . " things have calmed down a lot now ; england has moved on , and it 's more to do with the sport now .

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "
complete data available in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files in bad arolsen are in a variety of sizes , forms and writing styles the two institutions received some 12 million digitized documents , about one-third of the bad arolsen archive .
the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "
complete data available in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files in bad arolsen are in a variety of sizes , forms and writing styles the two institutions received some 12 million digitized documents , about one-third of the bad arolsen archive .
the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

" the one who has detonated the mine is a boy and has been arrested , " sayed ansari , spokesman for the intelligence service national directorate for security -lrb- nds -rrb- told the german dpa news agency .
" he was arrested by our national directorate of security forces two hours after the incident , " ansari said , adding that the boy , who was reported to be either 15 or 16 years old , was being interrogated and that the reason for the attack remained unclear .
the online version of the german newsmagazine der spiegel also reported tuesday that a young afghan had been arrested in connection with the bombing .
neither the german foreign office nor the federal criminal police , in which the three officers served , confirmed the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in berlin fear germans may become the targets of further violence western security officials told dpa they highly doubted the boy was responsible for causing the explosion that killed the three officers attached to the german embassy in kabul last wednesday .
taliban members said they were responsible for the attack , though the claim could not be independently confirmed .
influencing german debate the bombing last week , the kidnapping of a german aid worker , who was later released and returned to germany on wednesday , and the ongoing hostage crisis surrounding a 62-year-old german engineer have raised concerns that the taliban is targeting germans to influence the domestic debate surrounding three bundeswehr deployments to afghanistan .
" those behind the attacks and kidnappings want to sabotage our long-term engagement , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told weekly newspaper die zeit .
" that 's why we ca n't give in to them . "

german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .
" the family ministry is overwhelmed . " excess of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70 police officers were engaged in breaking up the assailants the german government meanwhile has condemned sunday 's attack , in which eight indian men were pursued through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony by a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans . around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence . " volker kauder , head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , expressed shame and disappointment . " i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these documents reflect the most despicable operations of the nazi era and constitute an essential part of our archive , " its director reto meister said in a statement tuesday .
the its , an arm of the international committee of the red cross , helps survivors of the camps to claim pensions and compensation and assists families who want to know where their loved ones suffered .
more access for researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerusalem 's yad vashem received one of the partial copies of the archive " above all , the victims of the holocaust , their families and researchers stand to benefit from this development , " meister said .
" after a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files . "
the its had withheld the papers from researchers until the 11-member , international commission governing the archives agreed in may to sidestep legal barriers and allow wider access in a move jakob kellenberger , the president of the icrc , called " a first step " to providing broader access to the documents .
the change will allow historians to view the collections in bad arolsen as well as the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the yad vashem martyrs ' and heroes ' remembrance authority in jerusalem .
" this first transfer is the beginning of a major undertaking , " sara j. bloomfield , director of the washington museum , said in a statement tuesday .
" our goal is to help survivors . "
complete data available in 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files in bad arolsen are in a variety of sizes , forms and writing styles the two institutions received some 12 million digitized documents , about one-third of the bad arolsen archive .
the rest of the files , most of which are written by hand and sometimes in an old german script , are scheduled to be digitized and delivered by early 2009 .
all of the data will be made available to researchers and the public after all 11 its member states ratify the legal change .
italy , france and greece have yet to ratify the agreement , while the united states led pressure to open the sealed archives to families and others before the last holocaust survivors die .
the data was transferred under embargo to allow officials to begin processing the files and making technical preparations for the archive 's formal opening , meister said .
" the material received last night is complex and vast , taken from a number of camps , which is organized in complicated and varying ways , " avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem , said in a statement tuesday .
" we expect it will take a lot of resources to sift through the material and catalog it . "
the documents , kept in six buildings at bad arolsen , a remote town in hills north of frankfurt , are only a part of the world 's scattered stock of personal data on nazi victims .

" yesterday , it was people of color , today it 's foreigners , and tomorrow it could be gays and lesbians , or , perhaps , jews , " kramer was quoted as saying on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephan kramer say the government is not doing enough he lamented the lack of a coordinated " nationwide plan of action " when it comes to right-wing extremism and accused german politicians of taking up predictable positions without re-evaluating their strategy in combating racism . " in the last few months , nothing really changed in the way this topic is treated , " he said .
" instead , we 've lost a lot of time and have new victims to mourn for . " measures against right-wing extremism falls under the jurisdiction of germany 's family ministry .
the ministry has allotted 24 million euros -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- this year for outreach programs that promote tolerance , many focusing on anti-semitism and xenophobia . according to kramer , however , the ministry is unable to cope with the issue and should be relieved of this responsibility . " the interior ministry has the necessary experience and the know-how for dealing with the issue , " he said .
" the family ministry is overwhelmed . " excess of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70 police officers were engaged in breaking up the assailants the german government meanwhile has condemned sunday 's attack , in which eight indian men were pursued through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony by a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans . around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital . the minister responsible for reconstruction in the states of former east germany , wolfgang tiefensee , spoke on tuesday of an " unendurable excess of violence . " volker kauder , head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , expressed shame and disappointment . " i am deeply hurt that something like this is possible in our country , " kauder told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , also a cdu member , said that such a form of violence , " whether it 's directed towards foreigners , or locals , can not be tolerated . "
he warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pleaded in an interview on national television for an objective police investigation of the case . on tuesday , some 200 demonstrators gathered in mügeln to condemn the attack . rekindled debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating the incident indian ambassador to germany meera shankar also voiced her concern over the incident and called for measures to be taken so that such events could be avoided in the future . " it has to be ensured that there is no repetition of such a thing , " she told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , also calling for a thorough police investigation of the attack . shankar said an indian diplomat had been dispatched to mügeln to speak to the victims and discuss the security situation with officials in the area . the debate about right-wing extremism and , in particular , the so-called " no-go areas " in eastern german states , was sparked shortly before the soccer world cup in 2006 , by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said at the time that non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . the incident in mügeln has rekindled the debate . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . saxony is a stronghold of the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which received 9 percent of votes in a state election in 2004 and is now represented in the state parliament in dresden . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he put in his first application to immigrate to germany with his family in 2000 , motivated by what he perceived as a growing anti-semitism in russia . as a jew , he had already had a number of unpleasant experiences involving verbal and even physical abuse , as some people took out on him their frustrations with the spread of anarchy and uncertainty in russian society .
in his younger days , konstantin had been to germany a number of times , singing with a boys ' choir .
he felt a kinship with german culture .
but his financial situation was another factor .
konstantin was singing in four ensembles , including the moscow jewish men 's choir , but still had difficulties feeding his family .
he felt undeterred by germany 's own dark history of anti-semitism , convinced that the german people had fundamentally changed since then .
his mother , however , is constantly haunted by the knowledge that most of her own family was killed by the nazis in the ukraine .
but she had little choice but to agree to accompany konstantin , her only child , and her daughter-in-law and grandson .
the family 's first address in germany is temporary housing for immigrants in bosdorf , outside leipzig .

the government watered down its climate goals to protect companies from added costs , according to a statement wednesday from the climate alliance , which represents over 60 german environmental protection groups .
the umbrella organization said the transportation and economics ministries were particularly at fault for slowing german greenhouse gas reductions by not requiring companies to lower their emissions .
groups want clear-cut plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups questioned whether merkel will be known for helping the environment the world wildlife fund said the government would " fail terrifically " if it did not set strict limits for industrial greenhouse gas emissions , according to regine günther , head of wwf germany 's climate section .
" the plan lacks verifiable , quantifiable goals for the individual measures , " she said tuesday in a statement .
the " abundance of announcements without a concrete timetable " needed to be supplemented with clear targets , gerhard timm , director of friends of the earth germany , said tuesday in a statement .
" our main criticism is that the package of measures is simply not enough , " timm added .
" we hope the government is going to improve it . "
proposals fall short of goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build more than 20 new coal-fired power plants also came under fire a spokesman for the environment ministry said the government 's plan set some of the world 's most ambitious climate protection goals .
" before the professional bean counters talk about everything that is not in the packet , i can only suggest they read everything that is in it , " the spokesman told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on tuesday .
german chancellor angela merkel has set a goal of reducing germany 's greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 .
proposals to reach this goal include extending support for more efficient energy use in homes , better automobile fuel consumption and increasing electricity production from renewable sources to between 25 percent and 30 percent by 2020 .
a study commissioned by greenpeace , however , said suggested measures for cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a drop of 215 tons of co2 by 2020 , falling short of the government 's goal of 260 millon tons .
" anyone who is still trying to curb the measures , as some industrial sectors are doing , has n't understood how serious the situation is and what kinds of big steps are really necessary , " greenpeace germany climate expert karsten smid said in a statement .

janitor travis brookins found the gun - once owned by elvis - while cleaning the toilet outside the museum .
the pistol was taken from a display case in the elvis after dark museum in graceland as fans marked the 30th anniversary of his death last week .
thousands of fans held a candlelight vigil at elvis 's graceland mansion and queued for hours to visit his grave .
caught on tape mr brookins first thought the gun was a toy , police told the memphis commercial appeal newspaper .
he pulled the black 9mm smith & wesson handgun out of the toilet and took it home to clean it , unaware of its significance until he saw news reports about the theft .
" he called us and said he thinks he had the gun and brought it to us , " memphis police lt jerry gwyn said .
lt gwyn said the thief may have accidentally dropped the gun into the toilet .
" of course , whoever dropped it would n't go in there , " he said .
the theft was discovered on friday when a visitor to the museum noticed a glass panel on the case was unfastened , and graceland officials checked the security camera footage .
a video camera had caught a man removing the gun from the display case .
the singer , otherwise known as " the king " , died of a heart attack on 16 august 1977 , aged 42 .
he is buried in a small garden beside the house at graceland .

welsh lib democrat leader mike german highlighted monmouthshire council where £ 89 is owed per household , compared to £ 55 arrears owed on average in wales .
however , the council said their tax collection rates were improving after installing a new computer system .
latest assembly government figures show across wales , £ 71.3m arrears are owed .
mr german , who is am for south wales east , said that local councils in gwent were " struggling to reduce a mountain of debt . "
he added : " and our local experience is being repeated across wales and in councils across the uk .
" every pound uncollected means more money has to be paid by those that do pay . "
according to figures released by the assembly government 's national statistics department , monmouthshire was the local authority in wales with the most arrears outstanding per household .
at the end of march 2007 , £ 89 was owed per dwelling against the welsh average of £ 55 .

" we also hope to install a new cash receipting system during this financial year , which will give council tax payers more payment options and therefore hopefully increase the collection figures , " the spokesperson added .
the council said it wanted to encourage people to pay their council tax by direct debit as it lessened " the financial impact on residents , reduces overall collection costs , creates a certainty of income for the council and avoids unnecessary recovery costs . "
but the council said it did not look to collect uncollected council tax directly from other council tax payers , if there was a shortfall in income .
it said it would be met from the council 's overall finances , which includes council tax .
overall , the total amount outstanding in wales at the end of march was £ 71.3m , a rise of 5 % on the previous year .
welsh local authorities collected 96.6 % of council tax owed in 2006-07 , the same as the previous year , but 10 of the 22 councils managed to increase their collection rate .
powys recorded the highest - collecting 98.8 % .
but mr german , whose party have backed a local income tax , said he thought that the council tax system was flawed .
" it 's expensive and complex to collect and by the looks of the latest figures too many people are not paying their share , " he said .

the tool is an add-on to google earth , a program that allows users to search a 3d rendition of our planet 's surface .
sky will allow astronomers a chance to glide through images of more than one million stars and 200 million galaxies .
optional layers allow users to explore images from the hubble space telescope as well as animations of lunar cycles .
" the basic idea is to take google earth and turn it on its head , " ed parsons , geospatial technologist at google told the bbc news website .
" so rather than using it to view imagery of the earth , use it to view imagery of space . "
dr john mason of the british astronomical association , britain 's largest body for amateur astronomers said : " light pollution and air pollution is now so bad in many areas that all you can see when you look up is a few dozen stars .
" if this helps people to realise just what they are missing , it is a jolly good thing . "
clear view to use the new system , users will need to have google earth installed on their computer .
digital astronomers can then zoom into an area from which they want to view the night sky .
sky layers constellations : connects stars and labels with name backyard astronomy : information on objects visible to the eye and small telescopes hubble space telescope imagery : 129 high-resolution pictures from hubble moon : two months of lunar positions and moon phases planets : positions of seven planets two months ahead users guide to galaxies : virtual tours through different types of galaxies life of a star : the different stages of a star 's life cycle " click a button and the world flips round and you see the sky from that particular location , " explained mr parsons .
" -lsb- the view -rsb- would be the constellations that you would see oriented in the sky on that particular day at that particular time . "
users can overlay the night sky with other information such as galaxies , constellations and detailed images from the hubble space telescope .
imagery for the system came from six research institutions including the digital sky survey consortium , the palomar observatory in california and the united kingdom astronomy technology centre .
much of the imagery can be found through searches on the internet but google hope the add-on will be simpler and more fun .
mr parsons said : " the sky you will be seeing will be a completely clear and you will be able to see objects which are very faint indeed - that you can only see with very large telescopes . "
virtual tour sky is not the first time google has ventured into space .
in march 2006 , the company launched google mars which allows users to explore the surface of the red planet .
another service , google moon , lets users view the sites of the apollo moon landings .
both services use data from the us space agency nasa , with which google signed an agreement in december 2006 .
the space agreement act was intended to put " the most useful of nasa 's information on the internet " .
at the time , nasa administrator michael griffin said the agreement would soon allow " every american to experience a virtual flight over the surface of the moon or through the canyons of mars " .
the two organisations also said they would collaborate in a variety of areas including adding data collected by nasa to google earth .
however , mr parsons said the latest tool was not a product of the partnership .
mass market google sky is not the only tool that allows astronomers to explore the night sky from their computer .
for example , stellarium is a free open source tool that gives people a chance to access more than 210 million stars , in addition to planets and moons .
the software is the brainchild of fabien chereau , a research engineer at the paris astronomical observatory , and is used in many planetariums .
like the suite of google applications , it allows people to explore places of interest on earth , as well as mission sites on the moon and mars .
commercial alternatives also exist , such as imaginova 's starry night , that offers a range of software packages aimed at beginners to " the serious astronomer " .
apple mac users can download a starry night widget that will allow them to see the night sky from any location on earth .
" the other astronomy packages are designed for maybe the more professional amateur market , " said mr parsons .
" we are aiming this more at the mass market .
if people get hooked and interested they may migrate to these other packages . "

stellarium shows the night sky in 3d for example , stellarium is a free open source tool that gives people a chance to access more than 210 million stars , in addition to planets and moons .
the software is the brainchild of fabien chereau , a research engineer at the paris astronomical observatory , and is used in many planetariums .
like the suite of google applications , it allows people to explore places of interest on earth , as well as mission sites on the moon and mars .
commercial alternatives also exist , such as imaginova 's starry night , that offers a range of software packages aimed at beginners to " the serious astronomer " .
apple mac users can download a starry night widget that will allow them to see the night sky from any location on earth .
" the other astronomy packages are designed for maybe the more professional amateur market , " said mr parsons .

like the suite of google applications , it allows people to explore places of interest on earth , as well as mission sites on the moon and mars .
commercial alternatives also exist , such as imaginova 's starry night , that offers a range of software packages aimed at beginners to " the serious astronomer " .

the carbon hero , designed by royal college of art graduate andreas zachariah , is a personal carbon calculator and works by tracking a person through their phone signal every time they go on a journey .
this then allows the device to work out the method of transport the user is on , and from that calculate the amount of carbon dioxide going into the air as a result .
" the idea is that , with around two billion mobile phones around the globe , it 's quite simple that you 're very likely not to be without one , " mr zachariah told bbc world service 's culture shock programme .
" as you move around , it tracks and identifies your movement , and tries to figure out what transport you are using . "
snapshot the carbon hero has already been awarded the british standards institute -lrb- bsi -rrb- prize for sustainability design .
the invention is in two parts : a keychain which calculates the relative location , velocity and pattern of a user 's activity and the mobile phone which displays the carbon used and the amount of credits needed to be purchased in order to offset the amount used .
mr zachariah explained that he wanted the carbon hero to cause " minimum disruption " to the user , and so it works in the background of the phone .
he also said that , although it tracks the user through their signal , this need not equate to fears about the information being shared .
" i 'm not a particularly big fan of big brother watching me , so one thing quite pertinent to me is the way the system works - it does n't let anyone else know your movement , " he said .
i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents andreas zachariah " it 's a private system ; your privacy and security are n't compromised . "
mr zachariah added that the carbon hero can be " a lot more accurate " than any carbon calculator website .
" a carbon calculator site will inform you like a snapshot - like going to the doctors and being asked ' how many units of alcohol did you drink , how many cigarettes did you smoke ' and you rummage in your brain and come up with something .
" this is quite a leap , because unlike a carbon calculator site , this actually does it in the background for you , working out how much you drank and cigarettes you smoked . "
the device is currently configured to work in the uk , although it has also incorporated 1,000 thousand airports from around the world .
in theory , a person can travel anywhere and have their journey included in the carbon footprint calculation as well .
mr zachariah said that he is now working with a number of people to exploit commercial potential from the device .
" i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents .
" we 're in interesting times .
what i really like is that there is tremendous goodwill out there , and people really want to start to make a difference .
" if you look at the uk last year , 140,000 people voluntarily offset their flights .
so the consumer is pushing and engaging the organisations . "

the carbon hero , designed by royal college of art graduate andreas zachariah , is a personal carbon calculator and works by tracking a person through their phone signal every time they go on a journey .
this then allows the device to work out the method of transport the user is on , and from that calculate the amount of carbon dioxide going into the air as a result .
" the idea is that , with around two billion mobile phones around the globe , it 's quite simple that you 're very likely not to be without one , " mr zachariah told bbc world service 's culture shock programme .
" as you move around , it tracks and identifies your movement , and tries to figure out what transport you are using . "
snapshot the carbon hero has already been awarded the british standards institute -lrb- bsi -rrb- prize for sustainability design .
the invention is in two parts : a keychain which calculates the relative location , velocity and pattern of a user 's activity and the mobile phone which displays the carbon used and the amount of credits needed to be purchased in order to offset the amount used .
mr zachariah explained that he wanted the carbon hero to cause " minimum disruption " to the user , and so it works in the background of the phone .
he also said that , although it tracks the user through their signal , this need not equate to fears about the information being shared .
" i 'm not a particularly big fan of big brother watching me , so one thing quite pertinent to me is the way the system works - it does n't let anyone else know your movement , " he said .
i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents andreas zachariah " it 's a private system ; your privacy and security are n't compromised . "
mr zachariah added that the carbon hero can be " a lot more accurate " than any carbon calculator website .
" a carbon calculator site will inform you like a snapshot - like going to the doctors and being asked ' how many units of alcohol did you drink , how many cigarettes did you smoke ' and you rummage in your brain and come up with something .
" this is quite a leap , because unlike a carbon calculator site , this actually does it in the background for you , working out how much you drank and cigarettes you smoked . "
the device is currently configured to work in the uk , although it has also incorporated 1,000 thousand airports from around the world .
in theory , a person can travel anywhere and have their journey included in the carbon footprint calculation as well .
mr zachariah said that he is now working with a number of people to exploit commercial potential from the device .
" i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents .
" we 're in interesting times .
what i really like is that there is tremendous goodwill out there , and people really want to start to make a difference .
" if you look at the uk last year , 140,000 people voluntarily offset their flights .
so the consumer is pushing and engaging the organisations . "

" the idea is that , with around two billion mobile phones around the globe , it 's quite simple that you 're very likely not to be without one , " mr zachariah told bbc world service 's culture shock programme .
" as you move around , it tracks and identifies your movement , and tries to figure out what transport you are using . "
snapshot the carbon hero has already been awarded the british standards institute -lrb- bsi -rrb- prize for sustainability design .
the invention is in two parts : a keychain which calculates the relative location , velocity and pattern of a user 's activity and the mobile phone which displays the carbon used and the amount of credits needed to be purchased in order to offset the amount used .
mr zachariah explained that he wanted the carbon hero to cause " minimum disruption " to the user , and so it works in the background of the phone .
he also said that , although it tracks the user through their signal , this need not equate to fears about the information being shared .
" i 'm not a particularly big fan of big brother watching me , so one thing quite pertinent to me is the way the system works - it does n't let anyone else know your movement , " he said .
i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents andreas zachariah " it 's a private system ; your privacy and security are n't compromised . "
mr zachariah added that the carbon hero can be " a lot more accurate " than any carbon calculator website .
" a carbon calculator site will inform you like a snapshot - like going to the doctors and being asked ' how many units of alcohol did you drink , how many cigarettes did you smoke ' and you rummage in your brain and come up with something .
" this is quite a leap , because unlike a carbon calculator site , this actually does it in the background for you , working out how much you drank and cigarettes you smoked . "
the device is currently configured to work in the uk , although it has also incorporated 1,000 thousand airports from around the world .
in theory , a person can travel anywhere and have their journey included in the carbon footprint calculation as well .
mr zachariah said that he is now working with a number of people to exploit commercial potential from the device .
" i 'm already seeing people who understand the opportunity that this represents .
" we 're in interesting times .
what i really like is that there is tremendous goodwill out there , and people really want to start to make a difference .
" if you look at the uk last year , 140,000 people voluntarily offset their flights .
so the consumer is pushing and engaging the organisations . "

the dates are being rescheduled in early 2008 , but her uk concerts in october and november " remain in place " .
a statement said the problems were " due to the rigours involved in touring " .
the star , who was recently taken to hospital and has reportedly been in rehab , has apparently been ordered to rest herself .
in the statement , winehouse 's spokeswoman tracy miller said the singer had been " advised " to postpone her north american shows until next year .
" until then , amy has been ordered to rest and is working with medical professionals to address her health , " she said .
' exhaustion ' winehouse recently pulled out of commitments including the v festival , two gigs with the rolling stones in germany and scotland 's t in the park .
it is unclear whether she will still appear as at the mtv music video awards in las vegas on 9 september .
she has been nominated for three awards - best female artist , video of the year and best newcomer .
the singer was treated in hospital earlier this month suffering from " severe exhaustion " .
speaking to reporters in london last week , winehouse 's husband blake fielder-civil said newspaper reports saying winehouse was a drug addict had been greatly exaggerated .
" the main thing is that me and amy are getting better .
do n't worry , she 's being looked after , " he said .
" she 's determined to get well .
it 's not as bad as everyone thinks but she 's fine , she 's loved and looked after . "

the dates are being rescheduled in early 2008 , but her uk concerts in october and november " remain in place " .
a statement said the problems were " due to the rigours involved in touring " .
the star , who was recently taken to hospital and has reportedly been in rehab , has apparently been ordered to rest herself .
in the statement , winehouse 's spokeswoman tracy miller said the singer had been " advised " to postpone her north american shows until next year .
" until then , amy has been ordered to rest and is working with medical professionals to address her health , " she said .
' exhaustion ' winehouse recently pulled out of commitments including the v festival , two gigs with the rolling stones in germany and scotland 's t in the park .
it is unclear whether she will still appear as at the mtv music video awards in las vegas on 9 september .
she has been nominated for three awards - best female artist , video of the year and best newcomer .
the singer was treated in hospital earlier this month suffering from " severe exhaustion " .
speaking to reporters in london last week , winehouse 's husband blake fielder-civil said newspaper reports saying winehouse was a drug addict had been greatly exaggerated .
" the main thing is that me and amy are getting better .
do n't worry , she 's being looked after , " he said .
" she 's determined to get well .
it 's not as bad as everyone thinks but she 's fine , she 's loved and looked after . "

the bbc 's james coomarasamy says the criticism is in keeping with previous inquiries into the 11 september attacks .
it is notable , however , for having an unusually critical tone for an internal inquiry and for its personal criticism of mr tenet .
in a statement , the former cia director said he had implemented a " robust plan , marked by extraordinary effort and dedication to fighting terrorism , dating back to long before 9/11 " .

it said money was raised through media appeals and volunteers ' fund-raising .

he said a wooden building had been constructed for the centre and a shower installed for washing oiled birds . "

" the new unit will have two casualty rooms where prey and predator can be kept separately to reduce stress , " said unit manager alec anscombe .
he said the unit was in the grounds of the horsebridge veterinary practice and the charity would have access to veterinary facilities .
old cages and equipment are still being used while fund-raising continues , he added .
in may , the charity said it needed £ 15,000 for the unit , and was also facing a big increase in call-outs .
the aim of the wras is to reduce suffering and deals with a variety of animals from small birds to swans , mice and badgers .

staff and union representatives were picketing five sites - including the world museum and walker art gallery - in the one-day walkout on wednesday .
museum bosses said all the attractions remained open and the public would not be affected by the action .
members of the prospect and public commercial services unions are taking the action in a dispute over pay .
they claim an imposed pay offer of 1.8 % for 2007 and 1.3 % for 2008 amounts to less than half the rate of inflation .
' reasonable offer ' paul noon , general secretary of prospect , said : " the museum 's pathetic pay offer does no justice to our members , the museum itself or the great city of liverpool .
" next year liverpool is the european capital of culture and the museum will be promoting the city to millions of visitors .
" to impose a pay cut on staff for two years running while asking them to promote the city 's image at home and abroad is nothing less than cynical exploitation . "
the museum is funded by central government and bosses have said the pay settlement followed extensive discussion with the department for culture , media and sport and the treasury .
a spokeswoman for national museums liverpool said : " in this year 's pay award , the majority of our staff will receive an increase of at least 3.84 % , which we believe is reasonable and realistic . "

they claim an imposed pay offer of 1.8 % for 2007 and 1.3 % for 2008 amounts to less than half the rate of inflation .
' reasonable offer ' paul noon , general secretary of prospect , said : " the museum 's pathetic pay offer does no justice to our members , the museum itself or the great city of liverpool .
" next year liverpool is the european capital of culture and the museum will be promoting the city to millions of visitors .
" to impose a pay cut on staff for two years running while asking them to promote the city 's image at home and abroad is nothing less than cynical exploitation . "
the museum is funded by central government and bosses have said the pay settlement followed extensive discussion with the department for culture , media and sport and the treasury .
a spokeswoman for national museums liverpool said : " in this year 's pay award , the majority of our staff will receive an increase of at least 3.84 % , which we believe is reasonable and realistic . "

following heavy rain and mudslides early this month , only villagers , council and clean-up staff were allowed to enter .
however the initial clean-up of the coastal village has now been completed .
residents are still hoping to find out the fate of their village hall , which was badly damaged in cliff mudslides .
alan campbell , aberdeenshire council 's chief executive , said : " i would thank visitors , residents and property owners for their patience while this initial phase of work was completed .
continuing clean-up " although restrictions may need to be introduced when further clearance works begins , it was clear the community would benefit from having a return to some degree of normality in the meantime . "
the council is continuing to work with insurers to ensure mud and other material surrounding some of the properties can be removed as soon as possible , he added .
insurers will also decided if the village hall needs to be replaced or simply repaired .
locals are then likely to decide what level of fundraising will be necessary to replace the facilities that existed in the old hall .
