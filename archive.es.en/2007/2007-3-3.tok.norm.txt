steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .
" african leaders also don ’ t have the impression that germany fully backs partnerships where both sides can act on an equal footing . " german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul stressed the need to secure more european aid for women in africa , particularly with a view to improving their access to micro-credits .
she also pointed out that more resources were needed in the fight against hiv / aids , adding that in sub-saharan africa more than 60 percent of all those infected are women . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .
we were never able to establish the same reliability which we are used to from our german plant . " germany attractive again to businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are more favorable in germany now frank wallau , representative of the german association of small and medium-seized businesses , says that years of economic stagnation in germany have slimmed down workforces here , making the country attractive again as a place to invest in and repatriate business . " quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .
ignoring the basic economics for fear of admitting a past error , they say , could become a costly if not fatal mistake . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .

" quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.03.2007 the netherlands opens up labor market to recent eu members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open borders : the netherlands now welcomes a new wave of workers the netherlands has now opened its borders fully to workers from countries that joined the european union in 2004 .
it joins eight other eu nations which have already benefited from the same move . the netherlands has dismantled its barriers one at a time . the first move was lifting restrictions on the number of workers allowed to migrate to the nation from countries that joined the eu ; a total of 22,000 workers were formerly permitted entry . in june 2006 , the government freed employers in 23 different sectors from the obligation of first having to search for qualified dutch or other people from old member states before hiring , say , someone from poland . in december last year , 16 other sectors of the labor market were added to the list . polish supermarkets in the hague tens of thousands of polish , czech and hungarians workers have meanwhile settled in the netherlands . " the hague now has a slew of polish supermarkets , " said günther gülker of the german-dutch chamber of commerce and industry . yet the netherlands ' borders did not open completely until march 1 , 2007 .
since then , workers from new eu-member states are welcome to work everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende is placing his bets on foreign workers there are over 250,000 jobs up for grabs in a country with just four percent unemployment . the construction industry in particular is desperate .
" there 's an acute shortage in that area , " said gülker . the dutch government and employers ' associations are convinced that the influx of new workers is boosting economic growth , which reached 2.9 percent in 2006 . " opening up the employment market can certainly have a positive impact on the economy , " said paul de beer , an economics professor at the university of amsterdam . economic sectors which have a shortage of workers can anticipate growth , he said . equal pay for equal work there 's a flip side too , however .
in the long term , liberalization can push wages down . " many workers migrating to the netherlands are willing to work for lower pay , " de beer said .
" that 's going to have consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam , the netherlands is famed for other types of work as well yet the dutch government has taken steps to protect domestic workers .
dutch law requires employers to pay newly arrived , foreign workers the same wages as their dutch colleagues .
in addition , employment agencies are to locate jobs for foreign workers . employers have also obliged themselves to finding proper accommodation for the workers . furthermore , a supervisory agency has also been established to handle complaints or infringements . germany and austria lagging behind the netherlands is n't the first country to open up its labor market .
great britain , ireland and sweden did not even impose limits following the eu 's eastern enlargement .
finland , greece , italy , portugal and spain have already abolished entry restrictions .
belgium , denmark , france and luxembourg will follow suit in 2009 . only germany and austria want maintain their liberalization phase in transition until 2011 . those countries argue that their geographical location put their employment markets at risk : their proximity to the new eu-member states bulgaria and romania would make them even more vulnerable to foreign workers migration . studies by the european commission confirm austria 's fears .
the number of citizens from " new " eu countries in austria has doubled in the past three years - to 1.4 percent .
in germany , however , the number has increased only slightly - to 0.7 percent . the munich-based economic research institute ifo confirmed the figures .
in 2004 and 2005 , around 24,000 eastern europeans moved to austria to work ; only 12,000 moved to germany . positive economic effects the number of " new " eu citizens migrating to " old " eu countries has remained stable following expansion . interestingly , figures should that the effects of foreign worker migration are positive : employees from eastern europe did their part in filling the demand for qualified workers in other markets , the european commission said . jörg lackenbauer , an economist at the center for european policy in freiburg , agreed .
more than 450,000 people have migrated to great britain from the eu-acceding countries .
" the effect on domestic employees was minimal .
" but the economy benefited from the effects of migration in that the potential for production and the gross domestic product rose , " he said . in germany , the debate about liberalizing the employment market for migrants has quieted .
but it could get louder soon : the czech republic has announced it will focus on liberalization during its eu presidency beginning in january 2009 . without the current transitional periods for liberalization for countries like germany and austria , the eu 's gross domestic product would currently be up to one percent higher , " said lackenbauer . " besides , liberalization of the employment market is one of the basic tenants of the single european market , " he said .
" the treaty for establishing the european community clearly dictates its implementation , " he said . thorsten schäfer -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania beefs up security at eu 's eastern frontier romania has prepared for its role as the european union 's new eastern border by installing a new high-tech security system on its frontier to keep non-eu citizens from entering the bloc it joins in january .

german insurers have discovered the market niche . for a long time , many muslims were critical of western insurances .
some quran scholars saw them as a game of luck , which is forbidden by islam 's holy scripture .
that 's because neither the insured nor the insurer know whether an accident will ever happen .
religious experts also compare insurance with interest to the content of a fishing net that has not been lifted out of water - it could be empty or full . but banks and insurance companies have not been deterred by this when it comes to making a profit .
orthodox muslims are a booming market segment , with growth of up to 30 percent expected just this year .
some say that products catering to muslims will make up 20 percent of the insurance market in 20 years . pure insurances that 's why insurers have developed products that are acceptable under islamic law .
munich-based facility for worldwide unit insurance -lrb- fwu -rrb- , for example , has discovered the middle east 's market for life insurances . " when we began in 2000 , we saw that the offerings for life insurances in islamic countries are quite small while the demand is growing , " said manfred dirrheimer , the founder and head of fwu .
" western products offered there either did n't conform with religious laws or they did conform , but did n't make economic sense .
we said that someone , who takes his faith seriously , should n't be punished with bad products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for help from above ?
men at the kuwaiti stock exchange fwu developed so-called takaful , or guarantee policies that conform with the quran , and has been selling them in the united arab emirates and kuwait .
the money of the insured can only be invested in places that have been deemed " pure " according to islamic law . " a classic insurance uses death rate statistics , " dirrheimer said .
" i look at when someone was born and then i know the probability that he or she will survive the contract .
the policy premium is based on probability .
and that 's a game of luck , according to an islamic point of view . " no demand in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying at a berlin mosque takaful policies on the other hand have people paying money into a fund , which gets invested according to islamic law .
in the case of an accident , the affected receives the money that has been accumulated .
the insurer therefore only administers a fund . as the first western insurer , germany 's allianz has also begun offering takaful policies in indonesia last year .
company officials are especially hoping for good business in the country 's aceh province , the first in indonesia that 's introduced sharia law . while the market abroad is booming , similar policies are not offered in germany .
while more than two thirds of the country 's three million muslims consider themselves religious according to the institute of islamic banking and insurance , there 's apparently no demand for such insurances . nugraha rizki -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamic bonds provide debt relief for german state the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds .

how did this idea begin , and what are your goals ? currently there are 150 of us .
just 20 days ago , there were only 30 of us .
for about a year , we 've been meeting with various human rights organizations , like the international league of non-religious and atheists . we 've always tried to maintain a unified voice when topics like honor killings , headscarves or religion classes come up in germany .
we 've tried to present our position , but there 've been very few opportunities to do so .
the media has n't taken us seriously . there 's a stereotype that all people from iran , turkey and so on are all the same and are all muslims .
so we decided to find a way that is provocative and gets people 's attention , because we do n't agree with the policies of the german government or with those of the muslim organizations . so you have political goals ? we 're waving a flag that says , " stop !
not in our name . "
we do n't believe that the muslim organizations represent the people from iran , turkey , iraq and so on .
they themselves are the problem .
they represent political islam in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 3.5 million muslims live in germany secondly , we do n't think that the german government should start anything with the muslim organizations .
if you look closely , you 'll see that these organizations represent a policy of separation between natives and foreigners , muslims and non-muslims .
they say that muslims and islam are unique .
they represent shari 'a law , a law that is hostile to women , children 's headscarves , religions classes , and honor killings in germany . they can not talk about integration .
integration means that people are people and should have an opportunity to stay and live here - regardless of where they come from , which religion they belong to and what color skin they have . these people 's main identity is a religious identity , and that 's an entirely different direction than integration . is it necessary to turn away from islam in order to support the struggle of your organization ? on the one hand , there is political islam , which is why we have the political demand that the muslim orgnizations not get involved in politics or everyday life . secondly , there is the religion itself .
we believe that many people in european countries have managed to be critical and put religion back into the private sphere and not make it a political issue .
i do n't think that germany is a purely secular state .
church and state are quite separate here , although i 'm very critical of religion in germany . our organization seeks to educate people that they do n't need religion to be happy in this world , but that religion can theoretically be a restriction . we have turned away from religion and from islam because islam is very problematic and is a movement that meddles in our lives and in politics .
that 's why we 've decided to take this path and be provocative , and we 've been successful . you 've said that you do n't want the german government to sit at the same table with the central council of muslims .
the central council represents three million muslim , and you represent only 150 . but that is only the beginning .
and no one in germany has done a survey to find out who feels represented by the central council of muslims .
in the future , i would like to find out how many people agree with the the central council .
we represent the unreligious - all those who do n't identify with the central council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government should not get involved with the muslim organizations , said ahadi are you afraid of the islamic extremists ? i 'm not new in this area .
i 've had problems with the islamic organizations for a long time .
in iran i was sentenced to death - and the sentence is still valid .
now i have a second death sentence for appealing to people to express their approval or disapproval of the central council . i do n't think you can let yourself be intimidated , although these organizations have a lot of power .
terror is a very important instrument of these organizations .
but they have millions of critics in iran , turkey , saudi arabia , sudan , egypt and in germany . are you against all religions , or just against islam ? i 'm against all religions . do you see a possible to reform and modernize islam without abandoning it completely ? i do n't think that islam can be reformed - and other religions ca n't be either .
those who want to reform islam can be my guest , but many have tried it and been unsuccessful .
on the other hand , the modernizaton and reformation of islam is a policy move on the part of certain european governments , in my opinion .
it 's just a way to justifiy working together with islamic governments .
political islam ca n't be reformed , it has to be answered with a social movement . abdo al-mikhlafy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de founder of ex-muslims group gets police protection an iranian human rights activist living in exile in germany has founded a group called the central council of ex-muslims .

how did this idea begin , and what are your goals ? currently there are 150 of us .
just 20 days ago , there were only 30 of us .
for about a year , we 've been meeting with various human rights organizations , like the international league of non-religious and atheists . we 've always tried to maintain a unified voice when topics like honor killings , headscarves or religion classes come up in germany .
we 've tried to present our position , but there 've been very few opportunities to do so .
the media has n't taken us seriously . there 's a stereotype that all people from iran , turkey and so on are all the same and are all muslims .
so we decided to find a way that is provocative and gets people 's attention , because we do n't agree with the policies of the german government or with those of the muslim organizations . so you have political goals ? we 're waving a flag that says , " stop !
not in our name . "
we do n't believe that the muslim organizations represent the people from iran , turkey , iraq and so on .
they themselves are the problem .
they represent political islam in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 3.5 million muslims live in germany secondly , we do n't think that the german government should start anything with the muslim organizations .
if you look closely , you 'll see that these organizations represent a policy of separation between natives and foreigners , muslims and non-muslims .
they say that muslims and islam are unique .
they represent shari 'a law , a law that is hostile to women , children 's headscarves , religions classes , and honor killings in germany . they can not talk about integration .
integration means that people are people and should have an opportunity to stay and live here - regardless of where they come from , which religion they belong to and what color skin they have . these people 's main identity is a religious identity , and that 's an entirely different direction than integration . is it necessary to turn away from islam in order to support the struggle of your organization ? on the one hand , there is political islam , which is why we have the political demand that the muslim orgnizations not get involved in politics or everyday life . secondly , there is the religion itself .
we believe that many people in european countries have managed to be critical and put religion back into the private sphere and not make it a political issue .
i do n't think that germany is a purely secular state .
church and state are quite separate here , although i 'm very critical of religion in germany . our organization seeks to educate people that they do n't need religion to be happy in this world , but that religion can theoretically be a restriction . we have turned away from religion and from islam because islam is very problematic and is a movement that meddles in our lives and in politics .
that 's why we 've decided to take this path and be provocative , and we 've been successful . you 've said that you do n't want the german government to sit at the same table with the central council of muslims .
the central council represents three million muslim , and you represent only 150 . but that is only the beginning .
and no one in germany has done a survey to find out who feels represented by the central council of muslims .
in the future , i would like to find out how many people agree with the the central council .
we represent the unreligious - all those who do n't identify with the central council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government should not get involved with the muslim organizations , said ahadi are you afraid of the islamic extremists ? i 'm not new in this area .
i 've had problems with the islamic organizations for a long time .
in iran i was sentenced to death - and the sentence is still valid .
now i have a second death sentence for appealing to people to express their approval or disapproval of the central council . i do n't think you can let yourself be intimidated , although these organizations have a lot of power .
terror is a very important instrument of these organizations .
but they have millions of critics in iran , turkey , saudi arabia , sudan , egypt and in germany . are you against all religions , or just against islam ? i 'm against all religions . do you see a possible to reform and modernize islam without abandoning it completely ? i do n't think that islam can be reformed - and other religions ca n't be either .
those who want to reform islam can be my guest , but many have tried it and been unsuccessful .
on the other hand , the modernizaton and reformation of islam is a policy move on the part of certain european governments , in my opinion .
it 's just a way to justifiy working together with islamic governments .
political islam ca n't be reformed , it has to be answered with a social movement . abdo al-mikhlafy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de founder of ex-muslims group gets police protection an iranian human rights activist living in exile in germany has founded a group called the central council of ex-muslims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 03.03.2007 germany makes african cooperation a top priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to use its eu and g8 role to improve ties and lives in africa german parliamentarians have backed the berlin government 's resolve to make better co-operation with african nations a top priority during germany 's current eu and g8 presidencies . in a critical review of european policies towards africa , the bundestag on friday demanded that conventional development aid for africa be replaced steadily by a long-term strategy of political and economic co-operation . addressing the national parliament , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier emphasized that traditional instruments such as debt cancellation and poverty reduction were no longer sufficient to assist african nations in their future development . he said that the european union , germany included , had a major responsibility in creating joint institutions to co-ordinate co-operation and promote good governance and respect for human rights .
steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .
we were never able to establish the same reliability which we are used to from our german plant . " germany attractive again to businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are more favorable in germany now frank wallau , representative of the german association of small and medium-seized businesses , says that years of economic stagnation in germany have slimmed down workforces here , making the country attractive again as a place to invest in and repatriate business . " quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .
ignoring the basic economics for fear of admitting a past error , they say , could become a costly if not fatal mistake . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?

steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .

" quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .

steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .
" african leaders also don ’ t have the impression that germany fully backs partnerships where both sides can act on an equal footing . " german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul stressed the need to secure more european aid for women in africa , particularly with a view to improving their access to micro-credits .
she also pointed out that more resources were needed in the fight against hiv / aids , adding that in sub-saharan africa more than 60 percent of all those infected are women . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .
" african leaders also don ’ t have the impression that germany fully backs partnerships where both sides can act on an equal footing . " german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul stressed the need to secure more european aid for women in africa , particularly with a view to improving their access to micro-credits .
she also pointed out that more resources were needed in the fight against hiv / aids , adding that in sub-saharan africa more than 60 percent of all those infected are women . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

and while it will still be possible to mark a card with a cross in person , many will vote online in the first ever internet election . the healthiest economic growth figures since breaking away from the soviet union are expected to see the current government of prime minister andrus ansip easily win another term . but this election is special for another reason : even though voting is allowed per regular ballot , everyone has been issued with special id-cards that allows them to vote via the internet , making this theoretically , the world ’ s first online parliamentary poll . estonia is the smallest , most northern , and least populated of the three european countries commonly referred to as the baltic states . like its neighbors latvia and lithuania , estonia acquired independence from russia at the start of the 1990 when the soviet union collapsed .
this left estonia ’ s 1.3 million people free to promote economic and political ties with western europe . healthy economy a boost to incumbent pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has already felt the benefits of eu membership estonia joined both nato and the eu in 2004 .
it ’ s also a member of the world trade organization .
estonia ’ s economy has been positively influenced by developments in finland , sweden and germany , three of its major trading partners . these countries all have a strong electronics and telecommunications sector and that has no doubt helped estonia in its quest to become one of the world ’ s most advanced it countries : this sunday , estonia will become the world ’ s first country where everyone who is eligible to vote can do so , via the internet .
since the year 2000 , the government has been issuing electronic id-cards with the aim to bring everyone online so that the entire country can vote online . it-specialist linnar viik , one of the driving forces behind the country ’ s campaign to connect up new technology and everyday life believes it ’ s a revolution .
" one million id cards have been distributed .
that ’ s a lot for a population of 1.4 million . " no one is expecting everyone to vote online .
but , in a poll on wednesday , 30,000 people cast their ballot via the internet . online poll already popular in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernity sits comfortably with tradition in estonia an opinion survey by the emor polling agency predicts that prime minister andrus ansip ’ s reform party together with coalition partner the centre party are set to easily win more than half of the 101 seats in the single-chamber parliament .
why ?
estonia ’ s economy surged 11.5 percent last year - the fastest growth figures since it entered the free market 16 years ago . just five percent of the country ’ s population lives below the poverty line , unemployment is below six percent .
furthermore , there is no talk of austerity cuts ; instead , social benefits for workers and pensioners are expected to increase . some experts say no government in power has ever been in such a good position before an election . marc caldwell -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia sees its future in genes the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .

" quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .

how did this idea begin , and what are your goals ? currently there are 150 of us .
just 20 days ago , there were only 30 of us .
for about a year , we 've been meeting with various human rights organizations , like the international league of non-religious and atheists . we 've always tried to maintain a unified voice when topics like honor killings , headscarves or religion classes come up in germany .
we 've tried to present our position , but there 've been very few opportunities to do so .
the media has n't taken us seriously . there 's a stereotype that all people from iran , turkey and so on are all the same and are all muslims .
so we decided to find a way that is provocative and gets people 's attention , because we do n't agree with the policies of the german government or with those of the muslim organizations . so you have political goals ? we 're waving a flag that says , " stop !
not in our name . "
we do n't believe that the muslim organizations represent the people from iran , turkey , iraq and so on .
they themselves are the problem .
they represent political islam in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 3.5 million muslims live in germany secondly , we do n't think that the german government should start anything with the muslim organizations .
if you look closely , you 'll see that these organizations represent a policy of separation between natives and foreigners , muslims and non-muslims .
they say that muslims and islam are unique .
they represent shari 'a law , a law that is hostile to women , children 's headscarves , religions classes , and honor killings in germany . they can not talk about integration .
integration means that people are people and should have an opportunity to stay and live here - regardless of where they come from , which religion they belong to and what color skin they have . these people 's main identity is a religious identity , and that 's an entirely different direction than integration . is it necessary to turn away from islam in order to support the struggle of your organization ? on the one hand , there is political islam , which is why we have the political demand that the muslim orgnizations not get involved in politics or everyday life . secondly , there is the religion itself .
we believe that many people in european countries have managed to be critical and put religion back into the private sphere and not make it a political issue .
i do n't think that germany is a purely secular state .
church and state are quite separate here , although i 'm very critical of religion in germany . our organization seeks to educate people that they do n't need religion to be happy in this world , but that religion can theoretically be a restriction . we have turned away from religion and from islam because islam is very problematic and is a movement that meddles in our lives and in politics .
that 's why we 've decided to take this path and be provocative , and we 've been successful . you 've said that you do n't want the german government to sit at the same table with the central council of muslims .
the central council represents three million muslim , and you represent only 150 . but that is only the beginning .
and no one in germany has done a survey to find out who feels represented by the central council of muslims .
in the future , i would like to find out how many people agree with the the central council .
we represent the unreligious - all those who do n't identify with the central council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government should not get involved with the muslim organizations , said ahadi are you afraid of the islamic extremists ? i 'm not new in this area .
i 've had problems with the islamic organizations for a long time .
in iran i was sentenced to death - and the sentence is still valid .
now i have a second death sentence for appealing to people to express their approval or disapproval of the central council . i do n't think you can let yourself be intimidated , although these organizations have a lot of power .
terror is a very important instrument of these organizations .
but they have millions of critics in iran , turkey , saudi arabia , sudan , egypt and in germany . are you against all religions , or just against islam ? i 'm against all religions . do you see a possible to reform and modernize islam without abandoning it completely ? i do n't think that islam can be reformed - and other religions ca n't be either .
those who want to reform islam can be my guest , but many have tried it and been unsuccessful .
on the other hand , the modernizaton and reformation of islam is a policy move on the part of certain european governments , in my opinion .
it 's just a way to justifiy working together with islamic governments .
political islam ca n't be reformed , it has to be answered with a social movement . abdo al-mikhlafy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de founder of ex-muslims group gets police protection an iranian human rights activist living in exile in germany has founded a group called the central council of ex-muslims .

how did this idea begin , and what are your goals ? currently there are 150 of us .
just 20 days ago , there were only 30 of us .
for about a year , we 've been meeting with various human rights organizations , like the international league of non-religious and atheists . we 've always tried to maintain a unified voice when topics like honor killings , headscarves or religion classes come up in germany .
we 've tried to present our position , but there 've been very few opportunities to do so .
the media has n't taken us seriously . there 's a stereotype that all people from iran , turkey and so on are all the same and are all muslims .
so we decided to find a way that is provocative and gets people 's attention , because we do n't agree with the policies of the german government or with those of the muslim organizations . so you have political goals ? we 're waving a flag that says , " stop !

integration means that people are people and should have an opportunity to stay and live here - regardless of where they come from , which religion they belong to and what color skin they have . these people 's main identity is a religious identity , and that 's an entirely different direction than integration . is it necessary to turn away from islam in order to support the struggle of your organization ? on the one hand , there is political islam , which is why we have the political demand that the muslim orgnizations not get involved in politics or everyday life . secondly , there is the religion itself .

steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .
" african leaders also don ’ t have the impression that germany fully backs partnerships where both sides can act on an equal footing . " german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul stressed the need to secure more european aid for women in africa , particularly with a view to improving their access to micro-credits .
she also pointed out that more resources were needed in the fight against hiv / aids , adding that in sub-saharan africa more than 60 percent of all those infected are women . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .
we were never able to establish the same reliability which we are used to from our german plant . " germany attractive again to businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are more favorable in germany now frank wallau , representative of the german association of small and medium-seized businesses , says that years of economic stagnation in germany have slimmed down workforces here , making the country attractive again as a place to invest in and repatriate business . " quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.03.2007 german companies repatriating production in reverse trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming home : problems in foreign countries have led to some firms returning to germany a rising number of german firms are repatriating their production , breaking the trend of the past decade in which thousands of manufacturing jobs moved out of the country in the drive for lower costs and better markets . researchers at the berlin-based german economics institute have found that especially in small and medium sized businesses , which are the backbone of the german economy , every fifth relocation abroad fails within the first two years .
the alleged promises of moving production are often outweighed by the costly side effects of setting up shop in foreign lands and cultures . eginhard vietz is the head of a german company that specializes in welding technology and pipeline equipment .
some three years ago he moved part of the company ’ s production to china in the hope of getting a foot in the door towards what ’ s believed to be a rapidly expanding market . only one year and a wealth of experience later he repatriated production to germany after finding out that his chinese workers were looking after their own business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad experiences in china led to a pull-out of some german firms " one day we decided to see what they do after work , " he said .
" we came up to a factory about 10 kilometers away in which they were setting up an identical production line for a chinese manufacturer . " the bad experience made by the vietz company in china seems typical of a country where even the multi-billion-euro transrapid magnetic-levitation train from germany has been copied recently .
michael hüther , economist at the german economics institute in berlin , says that especially smaller companies are likely to suffer when venturing abroad . companies forced to move back after just two years " in the sector of small and medium-seized businesses some 50 percent of their offshore ventures end up in failure , " hüther says .
" and some 20 percent of these companies were forced to move parts or all of their production back to germany within the first two years . " patent violation as a result of an unbridled capitalism like in china is only one of the reasons .
more often companies feel lost without the close partnerships with other businesses that have made them successful in germany .
and sometimes differences in culture and work ethics are to blame , as in the case of the n-tec company which recently repatriated its main-frame computer production from the czech republic . " there were always delays in deliveries from our czech factory , " says sven meyerhofer , the n-tec ceo .
" they used all sorts of excuses to explain the difficulties .
we were never able to establish the same reliability which we are used to from our german plant . " germany attractive again to businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are more favorable in germany now frank wallau , representative of the german association of small and medium-seized businesses , says that years of economic stagnation in germany have slimmed down workforces here , making the country attractive again as a place to invest in and repatriate business . " quality of production , on-time delivery and absolute reliability are german qualities that are re-emerging , " he says .
" companies here are also more aware of their german roots .
most importantly , however : the cost pressure has substantially reduced as a result of restructuring and years of wage restraint . " economists here say that repatriating production is already becoming a matter of do or die for some small and medium-seized businesses .

it joins eight other eu nations which have already benefited from the same move . the netherlands has dismantled its barriers one at a time . the first move was lifting restrictions on the number of workers allowed to migrate to the nation from countries that joined the eu ; a total of 22,000 workers were formerly permitted entry . in june 2006 , the government freed employers in 23 different sectors from the obligation of first having to search for qualified dutch or other people from old member states before hiring , say , someone from poland . in december last year , 16 other sectors of the labor market were added to the list . polish supermarkets in the hague tens of thousands of polish , czech and hungarians workers have meanwhile settled in the netherlands . " the hague now has a slew of polish supermarkets , " said günther gülker of the german-dutch chamber of commerce and industry . yet the netherlands ' borders did not open completely until march 1 , 2007 .
since then , workers from new eu-member states are welcome to work everywhere .

" there 's an acute shortage in that area , " said gülker . the dutch government and employers ' associations are convinced that the influx of new workers is boosting economic growth , which reached 2.9 percent in 2006 . " opening up the employment market can certainly have a positive impact on the economy , " said paul de beer , an economics professor at the university of amsterdam . economic sectors which have a shortage of workers can anticipate growth , he said . equal pay for equal work there 's a flip side too , however .
in the long term , liberalization can push wages down . " many workers migrating to the netherlands are willing to work for lower pay , " de beer said .
" that 's going to have consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam , the netherlands is famed for other types of work as well yet the dutch government has taken steps to protect domestic workers .
dutch law requires employers to pay newly arrived , foreign workers the same wages as their dutch colleagues .
in addition , employment agencies are to locate jobs for foreign workers . employers have also obliged themselves to finding proper accommodation for the workers . furthermore , a supervisory agency has also been established to handle complaints or infringements . germany and austria lagging behind the netherlands is n't the first country to open up its labor market .
great britain , ireland and sweden did not even impose limits following the eu 's eastern enlargement .
finland , greece , italy , portugal and spain have already abolished entry restrictions .
belgium , denmark , france and luxembourg will follow suit in 2009 . only germany and austria want maintain their liberalization phase in transition until 2011 . those countries argue that their geographical location put their employment markets at risk : their proximity to the new eu-member states bulgaria and romania would make them even more vulnerable to foreign workers migration . studies by the european commission confirm austria 's fears .
the number of citizens from " new " eu countries in austria has doubled in the past three years - to 1.4 percent .
in germany , however , the number has increased only slightly - to 0.7 percent . the munich-based economic research institute ifo confirmed the figures .
in 2004 and 2005 , around 24,000 eastern europeans moved to austria to work ; only 12,000 moved to germany . positive economic effects the number of " new " eu citizens migrating to " old " eu countries has remained stable following expansion . interestingly , figures should that the effects of foreign worker migration are positive : employees from eastern europe did their part in filling the demand for qualified workers in other markets , the european commission said . jörg lackenbauer , an economist at the center for european policy in freiburg , agreed .
more than 450,000 people have migrated to great britain from the eu-acceding countries .
" the effect on domestic employees was minimal .
" but the economy benefited from the effects of migration in that the potential for production and the gross domestic product rose , " he said . in germany , the debate about liberalizing the employment market for migrants has quieted .
but it could get louder soon : the czech republic has announced it will focus on liberalization during its eu presidency beginning in january 2009 . without the current transitional periods for liberalization for countries like germany and austria , the eu 's gross domestic product would currently be up to one percent higher , " said lackenbauer . " besides , liberalization of the employment market is one of the basic tenants of the single european market , " he said .

steinmeier hinted that past obstacles to arrange summits between african and european leaders which have largely centered on the zimbabwean president robert mugabe could soon be overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler on a recent trip to ethiopia for six , no , even seven years there ’ s been no summit meeting between eu and african state and government leaders , " steinmeier said .
" together with portugal which will take over the eu presidency from us in july , we ’ re poised to remove all remaining obstacles on the way to such a summit meeting which will hopefully take place in september of this year . " germany must reverse abandonment marina schuster from the opposition liberal democrats said co-operation with african nations had to be taken more seriously than in the past .
she criticized the fact that even the most basic structures to do this were often not in place and cited understaffed or non-existent german embassies in africa as an example . " we definitely need to reinforce our embassy staff in african nations again , " schuster said .
" the policy of creeping withdrawal pursued by the former government of social democrats and greens was disastrous .
and the situation has not yet been remedied . " where we have three embassy people in a given african nation , the french and the british are bound to have 14 or more .
which means that we are confined to operational work , while there ’ s no capacity for any strategic partnership . " africa of strategic interest to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von kläden conservative foreign affairs spokesman eckart von kläden stressed that increased co-operation with african nations was in germany ’ s own strategic interests , including greater energy independence from russia .
he reported about his recent trips to africa during which his hosts had complained about europe ’ s inertia in striking exploration and exploitation deals . " we ’ d have liked to co-operate with you , they say , but you don ’ t offer the sort of all-inclusive contracts that the chinese do , " von kläden said .
" african leaders also don ’ t have the impression that germany fully backs partnerships where both sides can act on an equal footing . " german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul stressed the need to secure more european aid for women in africa , particularly with a view to improving their access to micro-credits .
she also pointed out that more resources were needed in the fight against hiv / aids , adding that in sub-saharan africa more than 60 percent of all those infected are women . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

swansea nhs trust has so far received 1,000 people 's views on how wide-ranging the ban should be .
it already stops people from smoking indoors in line with new legalisation that takes effect in wales on 2 april .
other hospital trusts in wales who already operate smoking bans in grounds admit they can be hard to enforce .
around 1,000 people have responded to the poll in swansea , which will run until the end of the month .
the swansea trust has put forward three options .
what we do n't want to do is drive it underground and go back to the bad old days where a nurse would nip into the linen cupboard for a quick smoke pat dwan , unison the first sticks to the legal minimum which would allow people to smoke under canopies , outside entrances and elsewhere on trust grounds .
but this has only attracted 10 % support .
another 39 % said they wanted to ban smoking from near buildings but allow it further away .
but 51 % want to see a blanket ban .
a trust spokeswoman said although the results would not be binding the aim was to gauge responses for future decisions .
" the trust is currently looking at its smoking policy to see if it will go further than the new legislation in the months which follow , " she said .
under welsh assembly government legislation smoking will no longer be allowed in enclosed public places from 2 april pat dwan , unison health spokesman for swansea , who represents many hospital staff , said the union was in favour of the new legislation .
but he said it was difficult to see how wider ranging bans could be enforced .
" what we do n't want to do is drive it underground and go back to the bad old days where a nurse would nip into the linen cupboard for a quick smoke , " he said .
" there has to be somewhere for these people to go to wean themselves off . "
carmarthenshire nhs trust has already announced its smoking ban will include hospital grounds and car parks .
from 14 march , which is national no smoking day , staff and patients will no longer be allowed to smoke in any part of its hospitals including entrances , grounds , car parks and staff residences .
the trust 's workplace health co-ordinator john price said other uk hospitals had already introduced similar restrictions .
" even though some people will disagree about the stance taken , we have an overwhelming responsibility toward improving health and reducing smoking must be a key priority , " he said .
cardiff and vale nhs trust 's smoking ban has applied to hospital grounds for the last two years .
it hopes the introduction of the new law will make this easier to enforce .
shelters are being put up to encourage smokers who insist on lighting up in hospital grounds to move away from the entrances .
previously , patients who had received bad news were sometimes allowed to smoke inside but this will no longer be the case .
smoking rooms at two hospitals will also be removed .
the only exception under the new law will be at mental health institutions , including whitchurch hospital and the llanfair unit at llandough .
a ban including hospital grounds is also already in place at north east wales nhs trust hospitals and clinics , although enforcing this outside the buildings can be difficult .

party sources have told the bbc that internal party polls suggest that they are on course for significant gains .
and they also indicate that for the first time the assembly campaign will be " properly funded " .
the conference has been designed to showcase conservative candidates and to launch some flagship initiatives .
these include a £ 100 per household rebate on council tax for pensioners , which will cost £ 31m .
speakers at the conference today include shadow welsh secretary cheryl gillan , and the shadow foreign secretary william hague as well as the welsh conservative leader nick bourne .
the bbc understands that the assembly elections have been given a high priority by the party with the conservatives commissioning their first private polls in wales since the 1960 's .
party strategists are confident of gaining cardiff north from labour and the party will hope to take the assembly seats in clwyd west and preseli pembrokeshire where it gained parliamentary seats in 2005 .
other target seats include the new aberconwy constituency and carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire where the party faces three way fights with labour and plaid cymru . "
we are looking forward to a bright future for wales , not painting a dark , inaccurate picture of the past as labour has done " nick bourne , welsh conservative leader it also hopes to take the vale of glamorgan , where the party controlled the local authority until recently .
the party is also claiming that it has an outside chance of making " surprise gains " in constituencies such as delyn and agriculture minister carwyn jones ' seat of bridgend .
it 's understood that the party is limiting campaigning visits by westminster shadow cabinet members in an attempt to " show its welsh face to the voters " although the party leader david cameron will address the conference .
under the slogan " a new team for wales " the party will be setting out its key themes for the assembly election with debates on health , education , culture and the environment to be held today .
the party is expected to stress the need for greater choice in public services and highlight what it claims are disparities between the standards of some public services in wales and england .
more than 400 representatives have registered to attend the conference - the largest number for many years according to party organisers .
all the political parties , including the tories , are seeking to find practical , easily understood policies to demonstrate the difference they could make if successful in may 's poll . "
in recent history , conservatives have been on the back foot in wales " as delegates arrive in cardiff for their conference conservative prospects appear brighter than they have been for a very long time at a uk level .
members hope the gradual recovery in welsh tory fortunes will accelerate in the welsh assembly elections .
the party has gone from having no welsh mps in 1997 to now having three members of parliament and 11 assembly members .
mr bourne has promised to use the conference to highlight the positive difference his party could make to wales .
it follows last week 's welsh labour conference warnings that voter apathy could lead to a tory-led " nightmare alliance " running the country .
mr bourne has attacked mr morgan for describing conservative leader david cameron as merely a smooth spin doctor " who has never had a proper job " .
concentrated he said : " welsh conservatives will fight the election on our strengths , our record , our policies and our vision for wales .
" we are looking forward to a bright future for wales , not painting a dark , inaccurate picture of the past as labour has done . "
the tories intend to present themselves as a positive alternative government in wales while casting labour as a negative party which has run out of ideas .
in recent history , conservatives have been on the back foot in wales and you could be forgiven for believing they had never been a real political force in these parts .
look a little bit further back in time though , to 1983 , and you see a party with 14 welsh mps and 31 % of the welsh vote .
in that general election labour mustered 37.5 % of welsh votes , as a post-falklands conflict margaret thatcher went head-to-head with labour leader michael foot .
from then on it was a story of tory decline in wales , culminating in a wipe-out of all welsh conservative mps in 1997 , and the tories fell to under 20 % of the vote .
but while the conservatives remained the second most popular party in wales , it suffered because of the way its support was spread , rather than concentrated in particular areas .
strangely enough , it was devolved politics and proportional representation -lrb- pr -rrb- , both of which many conservatives had fought , that offered the party a life line .
with nearly all of its ams elected under a pr system in 1999 and 2003 , cardiff bay provided the party with a stage that helped prevent it from disappearing without trace in wales .

the party has gone from having no welsh mps in 1997 to now having three members of parliament and 11 assembly members .
mr bourne has promised to use the conference to highlight the positive difference his party could make to wales .
it follows last week 's welsh labour conference warnings that voter apathy could lead to a tory-led " nightmare alliance " running the country .
mr bourne has attacked mr morgan for describing conservative leader david cameron as merely a smooth spin doctor " who has never had a proper job " .
concentrated he said : " welsh conservatives will fight the election on our strengths , our record , our policies and our vision for wales .
" we are looking forward to a bright future for wales , not painting a dark , inaccurate picture of the past as labour has done . "
the tories intend to present themselves as a positive alternative government in wales while casting labour as a negative party which has run out of ideas .
in recent history , conservatives have been on the back foot in wales and you could be forgiven for believing they had never been a real political force in these parts .
look a little bit further back in time though , to 1983 , and you see a party with 14 welsh mps and 31 % of the welsh vote .
in that general election labour mustered 37.5 % of welsh votes , as a post-falklands conflict margaret thatcher went head-to-head with labour leader michael foot .
from then on it was a story of tory decline in wales , culminating in a wipe-out of all welsh conservative mps in 1997 , and the tories fell to under 20 % of the vote .
but while the conservatives remained the second most popular party in wales , it suffered because of the way its support was spread , rather than concentrated in particular areas .
strangely enough , it was devolved politics and proportional representation -lrb- pr -rrb- , both of which many conservatives had fought , that offered the party a life line .
with nearly all of its ams elected under a pr system in 1999 and 2003 , cardiff bay provided the party with a stage that helped prevent it from disappearing without trace in wales .
more than a few welsh conservatives must be daring to hope more welsh voters will be prepared to give them a chance e-mail this to a friend printable version see also tories ' oap council tax promise 02 mar 07 -pipe- wales half voters ' unaware ' of election 01 mar 07 -pipe- wales tory poll lead ' not worrying ' pm 27 feb 07 -pipe- uk politics hoodie pic ' proves cameron point ' 23 feb 07 -pipe- uk politics shame bad fathers , says cameron 22 feb 07 -pipe- uk politics nhs ' at heart ' of tory campaign 18 jan 07 -pipe- wales related internet links welsh conservatives the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories admission over nhs ' underfunding ' farmers ' ' badger cull disaster ' funeral of family after home fire most popular stories now most shared most read brazil 's chinese bikini problem most popular now , in detail most shared most read arizona shooting suspect charged virgin ' wo n't pay ' fees over snow how giffords survived the shot ipl cricket auction breaks record gates expresses chinese concern scores killed in iran plane crash fury over doctor 's book on sex education for muslims undercover officer switches sides brazil warns of global trade war obama hails south sudanese vote most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis praying for revenge widowed governor in philippines seeks curse plastic fantastic the loyalty reward programme for facebook fans path to the presidency could sarah palin win the republican nomination ?

treasury spokesman vince cable wants to hit " obscenely large " property investments and believes an annual 1 % levy could be the solution .
the estimated £ 1bn return would be used to cut inheritance tax and stamp duty bills for the less well off .
the proposals were announced in a speech at the party 's spring conference in harrogate .
the lib dems dropped their flagship 50 % top tax rate policy after the 2005 general election in favour of taxes on pollution .
but mr cable said it was time to take action to help middle income families .
' super rich ' setting out his plans to tackle " extremes of wealth " , mr cable said : " one issue we are looking at in particular is the obscenely large property investments being made by britain 's new super rich .
" britain 's richest billionaire , and labour donor , mr lakshmi mittal recently stumped up £ 35m for a new house .
" but even he has been put in his place by an £ 84m flat in park lane .
" the owners of these properties probably pay no more tax in britain than council tax which , for these residences , is about the same as is paid by a pensioner couple in a decent-sized suburban bungalow .
" by contrast , those middle income british pensioners , when they die , can now expect to bequeath their families a large inheritance tax bill , " mr cable said .
" the super rich do n't have to worry about such nuisances since they will have organised a tax avoidance dodge through a trust .
" i am determined that , through our further work on tax , we shall have a strong message of support , through tax cuts , for those of modest means who are being dragged into inheritance tax and higher rate stamp duty and ensure that these tax cuts are paid for by the very wealthy . "
' credit boom ' the party is looking at ways to force the best-off to pay more as part of a radical tax package agreed at its major annual conference in september .
mr cable also accused labour of presiding over an explosion in credit card debts " close to the level at the peak of the last , disastrous tory credit boom " .
he said chancellor gordon brown had " bottled out " of a confrontation with the high street banks over their " excess profits " , as highlighted in a report six years ago by the head of the london stock exchange .
" the banks have been running rings round him and ripping off their customers ever since , " he told delegates .
" it is time gordon brown started sticking up for consumers .
" he can start by acknowledging that the growth in debt financed consumer spending he has presided over has left millions with their future mortgaged . "
private equity mr cable also launched a stinging attack on " corporate predators " in the private equity industry , joining union calls for a crackdown .
" dozens of healthy companies are being devoured by sharp-toothed corporate predators misleadingly described as ' private equity ' - misleading since they are high leveraged with little equity and a lot of debt , " he said .
" private owners have borrowed heavily and enjoy generous and expensive tax relief on interest payments .
" companies that have none of the transparency and accountability of public companies are taking over supermarkets , water utilities or football clubs .
" they know little about the underlying businesses they acquire , strip out the assets and other easy pickings , and move on leaving their prey saddled with debt .
" a chancellor who was more concerned with guarding the public finances rather than telling us how to be british would crack down hard on the tax privileges of the private equity firms . "
