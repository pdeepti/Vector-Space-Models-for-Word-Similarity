17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .

an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .
14 , 2003 .
in another cell , " cockroaches and rats ran over my body , " he said .
" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .

some people are very protective of their chores .

" german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he planned to make " specific proposals , including the swedish problem " at the bloc 's next meeting of interior and justice ministers in april . humanitarian situation deteriorating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are expected to leave as violence continues the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that some 2 million people out of a population of 26 million have left iraq since the us-led war in 2003 while another 1.7 million have fled their homes to safer areas inside the country . while the number of refugees who reach europe has been comparatively small , some 20,000 applied for asylum in the eu last year , the number is quickly growing as bloodshed and instability in iraq continues .

they are drawn to the nordic country by a large iraqi population that fled there during the 1990s . a total of 9,065 iraqis sought asylum in the scandinavian country last year - with 3,000 coming in november and december alone - compared to 2,330 the previous year , according to official figures .
more than 80 percent of iraqi asylum requests since january 2006 have been approved . stockholm now wants its eu partners to share the burden and help provide funds to states neighboring iraq , such as jordan , syria and iran which have offered shelter to thousands of iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi neighbors syria , seen here , iran and jordan have received many refugees " i think it is an excellent step forward that the question of iraqi refugees is finally brought up onto the european agenda , " swedish migration minister tobias billström said after the meeting in brussels .
" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein .

" it is very difficult to come to the european union legally , so people who want to flee are forced to turn to smugglers , " magnus berggren , who is prosecuting a court case in sweden against alleged human smugglers , told the iht .

" we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees .

" german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he planned to make " specific proposals , including the swedish problem " at the bloc 's next meeting of interior and justice ministers in april . humanitarian situation deteriorating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are expected to leave as violence continues the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that some 2 million people out of a population of 26 million have left iraq since the us-led war in 2003 while another 1.7 million have fled their homes to safer areas inside the country . while the number of refugees who reach europe has been comparatively small , some 20,000 applied for asylum in the eu last year , the number is quickly growing as bloodshed and instability in iraq continues . " the humanitarian situation is grave and deteriorating , " said madeline garlick , a unhcr official .
" states should respond to the protection needs of iraqi asylum-seekers on their own territory . " sweden receives most iraqi refugees in europe sweden currently takes in more than half of all iraqi asylum seekers to europe .
they are drawn to the nordic country by a large iraqi population that fled there during the 1990s . a total of 9,065 iraqis sought asylum in the scandinavian country last year - with 3,000 coming in november and december alone - compared to 2,330 the previous year , according to official figures .
more than 80 percent of iraqi asylum requests since january 2006 have been approved . stockholm now wants its eu partners to share the burden and help provide funds to states neighboring iraq , such as jordan , syria and iran which have offered shelter to thousands of iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi neighbors syria , seen here , iran and jordan have received many refugees " i think it is an excellent step forward that the question of iraqi refugees is finally brought up onto the european agenda , " swedish migration minister tobias billström said after the meeting in brussels .
" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein . " well , rome was n't built in a day , " said billström .
" i think we have to be thankful for the fact that they do increase their quota . " human trafficking booming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has become home for thousands of iraqis the growing number of people looking to leave iraq has also led to an increase in cases of human trafficking to sweden , according to a recent report in the international herald tribune . the people smuggling operations are run like a travel agency where refugees are told where to bring money and receive a package of forged documents , whose quality varies in line with the amount they pay . " it is very difficult to come to the european union legally , so people who want to flee are forced to turn to smugglers , " magnus berggren , who is prosecuting a court case in sweden against alleged human smugglers , told the iht . " but while i have full understanding that people want to leave iraq , " berggren said , " what bothers me is that some people are making big money on the misfortune of others . " more refugees expected outnumbered only by 181,600 finns , some 79,200 iraqis make up the second-largest group of foreigners living in sweden , though it is impossible to estimate how many iraqis entered the country illegally . billström said he did not expect the number of asylum seekers to drop off as long as sectarian violence in iraq persists . " we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees . " though the eu hopes to institute a common agreement for asylum seekers across the 27-member bloc by 2010 , current directives require the country that receives an asylum request to handle it . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers discuss getting tough on illegal immigration eu ministers are set to discuss fighting illegal immigration into the european union by increasing cross-border police cooperation and data exchange at a three day meeting in berlin .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .

optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .

also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .

amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .

panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .
after 40 years in berlin , he tells me stories about how the city has changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign like this is a welcome sight when you 're fridge is empty on sunday you are germany despite the moments of neighborliness in kreuzberg , residents of the bordering " bezirk " neukölln recently elected two members of the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- to the neighborhood parliament .
like kreuzberg , neukölln is widely settled by middle eastern and particularly turkish immigrants , so it 's especially unsettling that npd-member thomas vierk says he no longer feels like he 's in germany when he walks down the street .
apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .
a notably diverse cast of residents with various ethnic backgrounds promised , “ you are germany . ” good will comes through living in berlin has shown me that these ads aren ’ t just lip-service to the idea of a globalization-era , ethnically-diverse population .
rather , the city truly is full of proud germans of different backgrounds eager to share their home with newcomers and foreigners , including hungry newbies still getting used to shopping-free sundays and a new society .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "

there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .

" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .

six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .

" saxony-anhalt 's permier wolfgang böhmer also voted for the reform but added that the agreement did not signal the end of germany 's healthcare debate . " we are at the end of a stage but the march will continue , " he said . six major german insurers said the reform did not solve any of the country 's healthcare problems and created news by adding bureaucracy and cutting competition . " it is only a matter of time until the next reform begins , " they said in a joint statement released on friday .
the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public . largely seen as a formality , the bill needs german president horst köhler 's signature before it becomes law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .

" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals .

" we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees .

" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein .

" more refugees expected outnumbered only by 181,600 finns , some 79,200 iraqis make up the second-largest group of foreigners living in sweden , though it is impossible to estimate how many iraqis entered the country illegally . billström said he did not expect the number of asylum seekers to drop off as long as sectarian violence in iraq persists . " we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .
the combination of a -rrb- , disappointment at finding all the films you wanted to see are sold out and b -rrb- , not wanting to go home empty handed after having waited in the queue for two hours can lead to ending up with tickets for films you weren ’ t really planning on watching , for example one about a pubescent girl with a vagina dentata -lrb- don ’ t ask -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chich !
faith may have started a new lidl bag trend last minute luck luckily for me , on this occasion i am saved from either of the above , as halfway home i get a phone call which changes the course of my evening dramatically .
a friend who , unbeknownst to me , is working at the festival -lrb- he had kept that one quiet ! -rrb- has a spare ticket for the premiere of “ i ’ m a cyborg , but that ’ s ok , ” which is starting in 20 minutes and do i want to come ? i hesitate for a moment , as i ’ m not exactly dressed to kill in my jog bottoms and scruffy trainers , not to mention the fact that i am carrying a lidl 's plastic shopping bag full of sweaty gym clothes .
-lrb- not too classy i know , but the leech effect of the gym membership on my wallet has prevented me from shopping elsewhere . -rrb- however , it would be a crime to turn down a ticket to a film premiere , so i jump in a taxi stopped at some traffic lights and tell the driver to " take me to the berlinale palast ! "
this feels quite satisfying , although i think i spot a disparaging glance at my plastic bag .
i race -lrb- at least trainers are better for running up the red carpet -rrb- past the crowds of screaming korean girls and equally non-plussed germans outside the cinema , find my friend , and we take our seats just as the host comes on stage to introduce the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans packed the theater to catch a glimpse of actor jung ji-hoon after the showing a happy end it ’ s a good film , a surreal but refreshing love story between a schizophrenic girl who thinks she is a cyborg and a boy who thinks he can steal souls , set in a korean psychiatric hospital .
the atmosphere in the cinema is exhilarating , and when the actors come on stage at the end , the korean fan base in the front row goes wild . and the good thing about not wearing prada , -lrb- or is it the lidl ’ s logo clashing with the red velvet of the berlinale palast ? -rrb- , is that a surprised claudia instantly spots me amongst a sea of elegantly dressed people and we all get to go for a drink and discuss the film afterwards . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier column february is the new january weighed down by winter blues , faith dennis tried aerobics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .

it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .

" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .
14 , 2003 .
in another cell , " cockroaches and rats ran over my body , " he said .
" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

" all i had in the refrigerator was a jar of strawberry jelly and an old pepper , puckering under in its glossy red skin .
amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .
after 40 years in berlin , he tells me stories about how the city has changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign like this is a welcome sight when you 're fridge is empty on sunday you are germany despite the moments of neighborliness in kreuzberg , residents of the bordering " bezirk " neukölln recently elected two members of the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- to the neighborhood parliament .
like kreuzberg , neukölln is widely settled by middle eastern and particularly turkish immigrants , so it 's especially unsettling that npd-member thomas vierk says he no longer feels like he 's in germany when he walks down the street .
apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .
a notably diverse cast of residents with various ethnic backgrounds promised , “ you are germany . ” good will comes through living in berlin has shown me that these ads aren ’ t just lip-service to the idea of a globalization-era , ethnically-diverse population .
rather , the city truly is full of proud germans of different backgrounds eager to share their home with newcomers and foreigners , including hungry newbies still getting used to shopping-free sundays and a new society .
that they do so in the midst of prejudice targeting them as unwanted foreigners only makes their good will more impressive . perhaps the government ’ s efforts to combat xenophobia will truly have come to fruition the day mr. vierk stops by beirut express for a " shawarma " of his own . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier column an annoying ripple in modern convenience moving is always a pain and moving to a foreign country is even harder .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .

" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees .

" german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he planned to make " specific proposals , including the swedish problem " at the bloc 's next meeting of interior and justice ministers in april . humanitarian situation deteriorating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are expected to leave as violence continues the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that some 2 million people out of a population of 26 million have left iraq since the us-led war in 2003 while another 1.7 million have fled their homes to safer areas inside the country . while the number of refugees who reach europe has been comparatively small , some 20,000 applied for asylum in the eu last year , the number is quickly growing as bloodshed and instability in iraq continues . " the humanitarian situation is grave and deteriorating , " said madeline garlick , a unhcr official .
" states should respond to the protection needs of iraqi asylum-seekers on their own territory . " sweden receives most iraqi refugees in europe sweden currently takes in more than half of all iraqi asylum seekers to europe .
they are drawn to the nordic country by a large iraqi population that fled there during the 1990s . a total of 9,065 iraqis sought asylum in the scandinavian country last year - with 3,000 coming in november and december alone - compared to 2,330 the previous year , according to official figures .
more than 80 percent of iraqi asylum requests since january 2006 have been approved . stockholm now wants its eu partners to share the burden and help provide funds to states neighboring iraq , such as jordan , syria and iran which have offered shelter to thousands of iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi neighbors syria , seen here , iran and jordan have received many refugees " i think it is an excellent step forward that the question of iraqi refugees is finally brought up onto the european agenda , " swedish migration minister tobias billström said after the meeting in brussels .
" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein . " well , rome was n't built in a day , " said billström .
" i think we have to be thankful for the fact that they do increase their quota . " human trafficking booming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has become home for thousands of iraqis the growing number of people looking to leave iraq has also led to an increase in cases of human trafficking to sweden , according to a recent report in the international herald tribune . the people smuggling operations are run like a travel agency where refugees are told where to bring money and receive a package of forged documents , whose quality varies in line with the amount they pay . " it is very difficult to come to the european union legally , so people who want to flee are forced to turn to smugglers , " magnus berggren , who is prosecuting a court case in sweden against alleged human smugglers , told the iht . " but while i have full understanding that people want to leave iraq , " berggren said , " what bothers me is that some people are making big money on the misfortune of others . " more refugees expected outnumbered only by 181,600 finns , some 79,200 iraqis make up the second-largest group of foreigners living in sweden , though it is impossible to estimate how many iraqis entered the country illegally . billström said he did not expect the number of asylum seekers to drop off as long as sectarian violence in iraq persists . " we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees . " though the eu hopes to institute a common agreement for asylum seekers across the 27-member bloc by 2010 , current directives require the country that receives an asylum request to handle it . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers discuss getting tough on illegal immigration eu ministers are set to discuss fighting illegal immigration into the european union by increasing cross-border police cooperation and data exchange at a three day meeting in berlin .

the kidnappers did not take the woman 's husband , an iraqi professor , hostage and are said to have spoke with other residents in the building . last week , germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .

" saxony-anhalt 's permier wolfgang böhmer also voted for the reform but added that the agreement did not signal the end of germany 's healthcare debate . " we are at the end of a stage but the march will continue , " he said . six major german insurers said the reform did not solve any of the country 's healthcare problems and created news by adding bureaucracy and cutting competition . " it is only a matter of time until the next reform begins , " they said in a joint statement released on friday .
the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public . largely seen as a formality , the bill needs german president horst köhler 's signature before it becomes law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .

" all i had in the refrigerator was a jar of strawberry jelly and an old pepper , puckering under in its glossy red skin .
amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .

apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .
a notably diverse cast of residents with various ethnic backgrounds promised , “ you are germany . ” good will comes through living in berlin has shown me that these ads aren ’ t just lip-service to the idea of a globalization-era , ethnically-diverse population .
rather , the city truly is full of proud germans of different backgrounds eager to share their home with newcomers and foreigners , including hungry newbies still getting used to shopping-free sundays and a new society .

" all i had in the refrigerator was a jar of strawberry jelly and an old pepper , puckering under in its glossy red skin .
amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .

apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .

on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .
the combination of a -rrb- , disappointment at finding all the films you wanted to see are sold out and b -rrb- , not wanting to go home empty handed after having waited in the queue for two hours can lead to ending up with tickets for films you weren ’ t really planning on watching , for example one about a pubescent girl with a vagina dentata -lrb- don ’ t ask -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chich !
faith may have started a new lidl bag trend last minute luck luckily for me , on this occasion i am saved from either of the above , as halfway home i get a phone call which changes the course of my evening dramatically .
a friend who , unbeknownst to me , is working at the festival -lrb- he had kept that one quiet ! -rrb- has a spare ticket for the premiere of “ i ’ m a cyborg , but that ’ s ok , ” which is starting in 20 minutes and do i want to come ? i hesitate for a moment , as i ’ m not exactly dressed to kill in my jog bottoms and scruffy trainers , not to mention the fact that i am carrying a lidl 's plastic shopping bag full of sweaty gym clothes .
-lrb- not too classy i know , but the leech effect of the gym membership on my wallet has prevented me from shopping elsewhere . -rrb- however , it would be a crime to turn down a ticket to a film premiere , so i jump in a taxi stopped at some traffic lights and tell the driver to " take me to the berlinale palast ! "
this feels quite satisfying , although i think i spot a disparaging glance at my plastic bag .
i race -lrb- at least trainers are better for running up the red carpet -rrb- past the crowds of screaming korean girls and equally non-plussed germans outside the cinema , find my friend , and we take our seats just as the host comes on stage to introduce the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans packed the theater to catch a glimpse of actor jung ji-hoon after the showing a happy end it ’ s a good film , a surreal but refreshing love story between a schizophrenic girl who thinks she is a cyborg and a boy who thinks he can steal souls , set in a korean psychiatric hospital .
the atmosphere in the cinema is exhilarating , and when the actors come on stage at the end , the korean fan base in the front row goes wild . and the good thing about not wearing prada , -lrb- or is it the lidl ’ s logo clashing with the red velvet of the berlinale palast ? -rrb- , is that a surprised claudia instantly spots me amongst a sea of elegantly dressed people and we all get to go for a drink and discuss the film afterwards . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier column february is the new january weighed down by winter blues , faith dennis tried aerobics .
despite a few run-ins - literally - with fellow exercisers obsessed with personal space , she just might have found what she was looking for .

on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .
the combination of a -rrb- , disappointment at finding all the films you wanted to see are sold out and b -rrb- , not wanting to go home empty handed after having waited in the queue for two hours can lead to ending up with tickets for films you weren ’ t really planning on watching , for example one about a pubescent girl with a vagina dentata -lrb- don ’ t ask -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chich !
faith may have started a new lidl bag trend last minute luck luckily for me , on this occasion i am saved from either of the above , as halfway home i get a phone call which changes the course of my evening dramatically .
a friend who , unbeknownst to me , is working at the festival -lrb- he had kept that one quiet ! -rrb- has a spare ticket for the premiere of “ i ’ m a cyborg , but that ’ s ok , ” which is starting in 20 minutes and do i want to come ? i hesitate for a moment , as i ’ m not exactly dressed to kill in my jog bottoms and scruffy trainers , not to mention the fact that i am carrying a lidl 's plastic shopping bag full of sweaty gym clothes .
-lrb- not too classy i know , but the leech effect of the gym membership on my wallet has prevented me from shopping elsewhere . -rrb- however , it would be a crime to turn down a ticket to a film premiere , so i jump in a taxi stopped at some traffic lights and tell the driver to " take me to the berlinale palast ! "
this feels quite satisfying , although i think i spot a disparaging glance at my plastic bag .
i race -lrb- at least trainers are better for running up the red carpet -rrb- past the crowds of screaming korean girls and equally non-plussed germans outside the cinema , find my friend , and we take our seats just as the host comes on stage to introduce the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans packed the theater to catch a glimpse of actor jung ji-hoon after the showing a happy end it ’ s a good film , a surreal but refreshing love story between a schizophrenic girl who thinks she is a cyborg and a boy who thinks he can steal souls , set in a korean psychiatric hospital .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon .

another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...

they seemed to be italian .

they tied my hands and feet . "

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon .

his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...

all this clowning around can mean big business for some but not everyone gets a slice of the cake . every year , in the run up to ash wednesday , massive celebrations take over the carnival capitals cologne and düsseldorf and drum up big business .
priya palsule-desai has the facts : whoever sets foot in germany 's biggest carnival department store , cologne 's " karnevalwierts " , at the beginning of february will get flashbacks of the good old days of winter sales .
clowns and fools elbow their way through plush , glitter and wigs in search of the right costume .
about 15,000 customers a day , come to the store in the weeks running up to rose monday .
although you can buy a costume for under 10 euros , the average carnival die-hard pays an average of about 30 to 50 euros for the right devil 's costume or nurse 's uniform .
toy and sweet industries get carnival boost according to a dresdner bank study , the toy industry made a profit of almost 300 million euros from last year 's carnival , and this seems to be on the up despite an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- this year .
karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .
14 , 2003 .
in another cell , " cockroaches and rats ran over my body , " he said .
" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

" german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he planned to make " specific proposals , including the swedish problem " at the bloc 's next meeting of interior and justice ministers in april . humanitarian situation deteriorating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are expected to leave as violence continues the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that some 2 million people out of a population of 26 million have left iraq since the us-led war in 2003 while another 1.7 million have fled their homes to safer areas inside the country . while the number of refugees who reach europe has been comparatively small , some 20,000 applied for asylum in the eu last year , the number is quickly growing as bloodshed and instability in iraq continues . " the humanitarian situation is grave and deteriorating , " said madeline garlick , a unhcr official .
" states should respond to the protection needs of iraqi asylum-seekers on their own territory . " sweden receives most iraqi refugees in europe sweden currently takes in more than half of all iraqi asylum seekers to europe .
they are drawn to the nordic country by a large iraqi population that fled there during the 1990s . a total of 9,065 iraqis sought asylum in the scandinavian country last year - with 3,000 coming in november and december alone - compared to 2,330 the previous year , according to official figures .
more than 80 percent of iraqi asylum requests since january 2006 have been approved . stockholm now wants its eu partners to share the burden and help provide funds to states neighboring iraq , such as jordan , syria and iran which have offered shelter to thousands of iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi neighbors syria , seen here , iran and jordan have received many refugees " i think it is an excellent step forward that the question of iraqi refugees is finally brought up onto the european agenda , " swedish migration minister tobias billström said after the meeting in brussels .
" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein . " well , rome was n't built in a day , " said billström .
" i think we have to be thankful for the fact that they do increase their quota . " human trafficking booming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has become home for thousands of iraqis the growing number of people looking to leave iraq has also led to an increase in cases of human trafficking to sweden , according to a recent report in the international herald tribune . the people smuggling operations are run like a travel agency where refugees are told where to bring money and receive a package of forged documents , whose quality varies in line with the amount they pay . " it is very difficult to come to the european union legally , so people who want to flee are forced to turn to smugglers , " magnus berggren , who is prosecuting a court case in sweden against alleged human smugglers , told the iht . " but while i have full understanding that people want to leave iraq , " berggren said , " what bothers me is that some people are making big money on the misfortune of others . " more refugees expected outnumbered only by 181,600 finns , some 79,200 iraqis make up the second-largest group of foreigners living in sweden , though it is impossible to estimate how many iraqis entered the country illegally . billström said he did not expect the number of asylum seekers to drop off as long as sectarian violence in iraq persists . " we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees . " though the eu hopes to institute a common agreement for asylum seekers across the 27-member bloc by 2010 , current directives require the country that receives an asylum request to handle it . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers discuss getting tough on illegal immigration eu ministers are set to discuss fighting illegal immigration into the european union by increasing cross-border police cooperation and data exchange at a three day meeting in berlin .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .
14 , 2003 .
in another cell , " cockroaches and rats ran over my body , " he said .
" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" " we are trying to help the two germans who disappeared in iraq to return to their families as soon as possible , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday . he said he would not comment on details in the magazine report to protect the pair , who were taken hostage on feb .
6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry said it would not comment on the report for the hostages ' safety despite the political ultimatums , which are a standard part of iraq 's nearly daily kidnappings , the ministry 's crisis team said it still believes the hostages were being held by a resistance group for criminal reasons , according to the spiegel report . the six kidnappers are thought to have close ties to local sunni militias due to the relatively calm abduction .
the kidnappers did not take the woman 's husband , an iraqi professor , hostage and are said to have spoke with other residents in the building . last week , germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de problems arise as germany moves to free hostages in iraq the government 's efforts to secure the release of two germans kidnapped in iraq are complicated by the fact that a key iraqi mediator who helped free former hostages has been left in the lurch by berlin .
-lrb- 14.02.2007 -rrb- motives unclear in kidnapping of german nationals in iraq two german nationals went missing a week ago in iraq .
it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- germany , others paid millions for iraq hostages , report says in spite of denials by top officials , germany , france and italy reportedly paid $ 45 million for hostages taken in iraq , a london newspaper reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .
survivors and relatives of the victims hope it will help them close a painful chapter .
-lrb- 15.02.2007 -rrb- europe compelled to confront left-wing terrorist past the scheduled release from prison of a former left-wing extremist has sparked a sharp debate in germany .
but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists .

they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 16.02.2007 cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr was only released from egypt sunday an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam . judge caterina interlandi on friday ordered the trial to start on june 8 , though all of the americans are believed to have left italy . osama mustafa hassan nasr , an egyptian muslim cleric , was abducted on a milan street on feb .
17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .

apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .

panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .
also on wednesday , the swiss government gave the go-ahead for a criminal investigation into the use of swiss airspace to fly nasr , also known as abu omar , to a us base in germany before he was flown on to egypt .
cia agent rejects court a european arrest warrant has already been issued for the 26 us citizens , but italian justice minister clemente mastella has yet to act on a request by milan prosecutors to ask washington for their extradition , saying late last month that he would decide the matter " soon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about cia " rendition " flights that happened within the bloc bob seldon lady , the former cia station chief in milan and one of the defendants , said through his lawyer last month that he did not recognize the court .
another former cia chief in italy , jeff castelli , was also among the accused . thirty-five people have been charged in the case : 32 for kidnapping and three for complicity in the abduction . the nine italian defendants include nicolo pollari who was fired as head of the italian military intelligence agency sismi in november following a parliamentary inquiry into the kidnapping .
his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...
two people seized me .
they seemed to be italian .
when they threw me into the van , i tried to defend myself , and they punched me in the stomach and all over my body .
they tied my hands and feet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasr says he was also held in cairo nasr is presumed to have been taken to the us air base in aviano , northern italy . " they tore up my clothes with knives and quickly put new clothes on me .
they took off my blindfold to take my photograph .
there were lots of special operations men .
my head was wrapped with sticky paper with holes for the nose and mouth , " he was quoted as saying . once in cairo , he was held in a secret service locale , nasr said . " they made me walk with my feet tied together .
i was falling , and they were laughing .
then there were electric charges , punches , slaps . " nasr said his interrogation lasted six months , until sept .
14 , 2003 .
in another cell , " cockroaches and rats ran over my body , " he said .
" when the guard came in i had to get on my knees or he would beat me with a baton that dealt electric shocks . ...
i had only moldy bread to eat . ...
because of the beatings , i am deaf in one ear . "
rome criticizes judge nasr has already announced he plans to take legal action against former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to seek damages for allowing the kidnapping . the italian government has taken action before the country 's constitutional court saying that the milan judge overstepped her powers by ordering the monitoring of sismi telephone conversations and the seizure of documents belonging to the agency . if the court agrees , the trial could be delayed for new appeals , italian media said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers adopt report , condemn cia secret flights the european parliament has condemned eu member states who had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia flights used to transport terror suspects .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

17 , 2003 and taken to egypt .
he was only freed by egypt on sunday and has since alleged that he was tortured while in detention . the trial would be the biggest case against us intelligence agents staged in an allied country and threatens embarrassing new revelations over the us " extraordinary rendition " program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to another . it has been one of the most controversial tactics used in the us " war on terror " unleashed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
judge interlandi 's ruling came after the european parliament on wednesday condemned eu member states which had turned a " blind eye " to secret cia " rendition " flights .

his deputy and seven other italians were also charged by interlandi . one journalist charged in the case has already negotiated a deal where a six-month prison term was reduced to a fine .
an italian policeman was sentenced to 21 months in prison , according to ansa news agency .
six months of interrogation nasr has alleged that he was beaten and humiliated during his detention of nearly four years . in a document obtained by the italian press , nasr said he was on his way to his mosque in milan when a red fiat pulled up alongside him and the driver said he was a police officer . " i gave him my residency permit , " nasr recalled .
" a small white van stopped alongside . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.02.2007 beirut express : you are germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg is a particularly diverse neighborhood in berlin getting hungry on a sunday got arden thinking about prejudice - and good will - in germany , via a trip to the local lebanese eatery and a tasty " shawarma . " all i had in the refrigerator was a jar of strawberry jelly and an old pepper , puckering under in its glossy red skin .
amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .
after 40 years in berlin , he tells me stories about how the city has changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign like this is a welcome sight when you 're fridge is empty on sunday you are germany despite the moments of neighborliness in kreuzberg , residents of the bordering " bezirk " neukölln recently elected two members of the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- to the neighborhood parliament .
like kreuzberg , neukölln is widely settled by middle eastern and particularly turkish immigrants , so it 's especially unsettling that npd-member thomas vierk says he no longer feels like he 's in germany when he walks down the street .
apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .
a notably diverse cast of residents with various ethnic backgrounds promised , “ you are germany . ” good will comes through living in berlin has shown me that these ads aren ’ t just lip-service to the idea of a globalization-era , ethnically-diverse population .
rather , the city truly is full of proud germans of different backgrounds eager to share their home with newcomers and foreigners , including hungry newbies still getting used to shopping-free sundays and a new society .
that they do so in the midst of prejudice targeting them as unwanted foreigners only makes their good will more impressive . perhaps the government ’ s efforts to combat xenophobia will truly have come to fruition the day mr. vierk stops by beirut express for a " shawarma " of his own . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden 's earlier column an annoying ripple in modern convenience moving is always a pain and moving to a foreign country is even harder .
but when student correspondent arden pennell had to wait 40 days just to use her new telephone , she decided something was wrong with this picture .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" all i had in the refrigerator was a jar of strawberry jelly and an old pepper , puckering under in its glossy red skin .
amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .

he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .

how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .
it also raised sharply its polish growth estimate to 6.0 percent from a forecast of 4.7 percent previously . the estimates were interim forecasts aimed at giving an idea of where the european economy is going between the publication of more complete predictions in november and may . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .
-lrb- 02.02.2007 -rrb- major euro zone expansion now on hold slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .
1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .

panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .

like kreuzberg , neukölln is widely settled by middle eastern and particularly turkish immigrants , so it 's especially unsettling that npd-member thomas vierk says he no longer feels like he 's in germany when he walks down the street .
apparently , the local voters who chose him agree . yet germany is striving to combat prejudices against a certain segment of the citizenry . the old view of “ germanness ” as a trait inherited through blood is being done away with through revised citizenship laws that allow those without german parents to become citizens more easily . publicly-funded poster advertisements for the berlin soccer team emphasize solidarity over discrimination , showing players with several skin-tones who explain , “ we are all white and blue , ” the team ’ s colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revised citizenship laws have revised the meaning of being german a 2005 nation-wide public relations campaign that aimed to cheer up the population with uplifting commercials also worked on hammering home the message of “ germanness ” linked to citizenship rather than ancestry .
a notably diverse cast of residents with various ethnic backgrounds promised , “ you are germany . ” good will comes through living in berlin has shown me that these ads aren ’ t just lip-service to the idea of a globalization-era , ethnically-diverse population .
rather , the city truly is full of proud germans of different backgrounds eager to share their home with newcomers and foreigners , including hungry newbies still getting used to shopping-free sundays and a new society .

on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .
the combination of a -rrb- , disappointment at finding all the films you wanted to see are sold out and b -rrb- , not wanting to go home empty handed after having waited in the queue for two hours can lead to ending up with tickets for films you weren ’ t really planning on watching , for example one about a pubescent girl with a vagina dentata -lrb- don ’ t ask -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chich !
faith may have started a new lidl bag trend last minute luck luckily for me , on this occasion i am saved from either of the above , as halfway home i get a phone call which changes the course of my evening dramatically .
a friend who , unbeknownst to me , is working at the festival -lrb- he had kept that one quiet ! -rrb- has a spare ticket for the premiere of “ i ’ m a cyborg , but that ’ s ok , ” which is starting in 20 minutes and do i want to come ? i hesitate for a moment , as i ’ m not exactly dressed to kill in my jog bottoms and scruffy trainers , not to mention the fact that i am carrying a lidl 's plastic shopping bag full of sweaty gym clothes .
-lrb- not too classy i know , but the leech effect of the gym membership on my wallet has prevented me from shopping elsewhere . -rrb- however , it would be a crime to turn down a ticket to a film premiere , so i jump in a taxi stopped at some traffic lights and tell the driver to " take me to the berlinale palast ! "
this feels quite satisfying , although i think i spot a disparaging glance at my plastic bag .
i race -lrb- at least trainers are better for running up the red carpet -rrb- past the crowds of screaming korean girls and equally non-plussed germans outside the cinema , find my friend , and we take our seats just as the host comes on stage to introduce the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans packed the theater to catch a glimpse of actor jung ji-hoon after the showing a happy end it ’ s a good film , a surreal but refreshing love story between a schizophrenic girl who thinks she is a cyborg and a boy who thinks he can steal souls , set in a korean psychiatric hospital .
the atmosphere in the cinema is exhilarating , and when the actors come on stage at the end , the korean fan base in the front row goes wild . and the good thing about not wearing prada , -lrb- or is it the lidl ’ s logo clashing with the red velvet of the berlinale palast ? -rrb- , is that a surprised claudia instantly spots me amongst a sea of elegantly dressed people and we all get to go for a drink and discuss the film afterwards . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier column february is the new january weighed down by winter blues , faith dennis tried aerobics .
despite a few run-ins - literally - with fellow exercisers obsessed with personal space , she just might have found what she was looking for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.02.2007 i ’ m not wearing prada , but that ’ s ok großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the berlinale palast , everyone 's in prada - almost faith got a once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend a berlinale premier - in her gym clothes . friday , february 10 , 9:30 pm .
on its second day , the 57th berlinale film festival is in full swing .
the stars are striding up the red carpet at the swanky berlinale palast at potsdamer platz , the place to be .
here in this plush cinema the competition category films will be premiered and judged by an impressive , star-studded jury . either connected or uncool in the somewhat less glamorous setting of my new second home , the gym , i watch these scenes unfolding on the tv whilst pounding away on the treadmill .
my friend claudia , who is cycling furiously on the neighboring machine , breathlessly tells me about how she has managed to get her hands on some rare tickets to the opening of korean director park chan-wook ’ s new film " i ’ m a cyborg , but that 's ok . ”
happy for her -lrb- albeit slightly envious -rrb- , i wish her a nice evening and set off home , plotting how i could get my hands on some tickets .
there are two ways to do this , seemingly : 1 -rrb- be " connected , " i.e. know and be prepared to beg someone who works at the festival and might have a few spare tickets .
-lrb- although i ’ m sure that , as well as a surplus of tickets , they probably also have a surplus of friends from feb .
8 to 18 every year -rrb- . 2 -rrb- or , alternatively , the " uncool " way , which is to stand in line at the box office with the common people and see what isn ’ t sold out by the time you get to the front of the queue .
this , however , can have dangerous consequences .
the combination of a -rrb- , disappointment at finding all the films you wanted to see are sold out and b -rrb- , not wanting to go home empty handed after having waited in the queue for two hours can lead to ending up with tickets for films you weren ’ t really planning on watching , for example one about a pubescent girl with a vagina dentata -lrb- don ’ t ask -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chich !
faith may have started a new lidl bag trend last minute luck luckily for me , on this occasion i am saved from either of the above , as halfway home i get a phone call which changes the course of my evening dramatically .
a friend who , unbeknownst to me , is working at the festival -lrb- he had kept that one quiet ! -rrb- has a spare ticket for the premiere of “ i ’ m a cyborg , but that ’ s ok , ” which is starting in 20 minutes and do i want to come ? i hesitate for a moment , as i ’ m not exactly dressed to kill in my jog bottoms and scruffy trainers , not to mention the fact that i am carrying a lidl 's plastic shopping bag full of sweaty gym clothes .
-lrb- not too classy i know , but the leech effect of the gym membership on my wallet has prevented me from shopping elsewhere . -rrb- however , it would be a crime to turn down a ticket to a film premiere , so i jump in a taxi stopped at some traffic lights and tell the driver to " take me to the berlinale palast ! "
this feels quite satisfying , although i think i spot a disparaging glance at my plastic bag .
i race -lrb- at least trainers are better for running up the red carpet -rrb- past the crowds of screaming korean girls and equally non-plussed germans outside the cinema , find my friend , and we take our seats just as the host comes on stage to introduce the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans packed the theater to catch a glimpse of actor jung ji-hoon after the showing a happy end it ’ s a good film , a surreal but refreshing love story between a schizophrenic girl who thinks she is a cyborg and a boy who thinks he can steal souls , set in a korean psychiatric hospital .
the atmosphere in the cinema is exhilarating , and when the actors come on stage at the end , the korean fan base in the front row goes wild . and the good thing about not wearing prada , -lrb- or is it the lidl ’ s logo clashing with the red velvet of the berlinale palast ? -rrb- , is that a surprised claudia instantly spots me amongst a sea of elegantly dressed people and we all get to go for a drink and discuss the film afterwards . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier column february is the new january weighed down by winter blues , faith dennis tried aerobics .
despite a few run-ins - literally - with fellow exercisers obsessed with personal space , she just might have found what she was looking for .

" german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he planned to make " specific proposals , including the swedish problem " at the bloc 's next meeting of interior and justice ministers in april . humanitarian situation deteriorating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are expected to leave as violence continues the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that some 2 million people out of a population of 26 million have left iraq since the us-led war in 2003 while another 1.7 million have fled their homes to safer areas inside the country . while the number of refugees who reach europe has been comparatively small , some 20,000 applied for asylum in the eu last year , the number is quickly growing as bloodshed and instability in iraq continues . " the humanitarian situation is grave and deteriorating , " said madeline garlick , a unhcr official .
" states should respond to the protection needs of iraqi asylum-seekers on their own territory . " sweden receives most iraqi refugees in europe sweden currently takes in more than half of all iraqi asylum seekers to europe .
they are drawn to the nordic country by a large iraqi population that fled there during the 1990s . a total of 9,065 iraqis sought asylum in the scandinavian country last year - with 3,000 coming in november and december alone - compared to 2,330 the previous year , according to official figures .
more than 80 percent of iraqi asylum requests since january 2006 have been approved . stockholm now wants its eu partners to share the burden and help provide funds to states neighboring iraq , such as jordan , syria and iran which have offered shelter to thousands of iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi neighbors syria , seen here , iran and jordan have received many refugees " i think it is an excellent step forward that the question of iraqi refugees is finally brought up onto the european agenda , " swedish migration minister tobias billström said after the meeting in brussels .
" i think the commission should now be given some time and space to come forward with concrete proposals . " he said jordan , syria and iran " are now seriously destabilized by the amount of people coming out of iraq , and we need to help those countries unless they are going to crack . " on wednesday , the united states announced plans to take in some 7,000 iraqi refugees this year , more than 10 times the number of iraqi asylum seekers it has admitted since the 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein . " well , rome was n't built in a day , " said billström .
" i think we have to be thankful for the fact that they do increase their quota . " human trafficking booming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has become home for thousands of iraqis the growing number of people looking to leave iraq has also led to an increase in cases of human trafficking to sweden , according to a recent report in the international herald tribune . the people smuggling operations are run like a travel agency where refugees are told where to bring money and receive a package of forged documents , whose quality varies in line with the amount they pay . " it is very difficult to come to the european union legally , so people who want to flee are forced to turn to smugglers , " magnus berggren , who is prosecuting a court case in sweden against alleged human smugglers , told the iht . " but while i have full understanding that people want to leave iraq , " berggren said , " what bothers me is that some people are making big money on the misfortune of others . " more refugees expected outnumbered only by 181,600 finns , some 79,200 iraqis make up the second-largest group of foreigners living in sweden , though it is impossible to estimate how many iraqis entered the country illegally . billström said he did not expect the number of asylum seekers to drop off as long as sectarian violence in iraq persists . " we must therefore expect further disturbances and a continued exodus of people , " he said .
" there must be solidarity between eu member states so that more of us share the responsibility for offering protection to refugees . " though the eu hopes to institute a common agreement for asylum seekers across the 27-member bloc by 2010 , current directives require the country that receives an asylum request to handle it . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers discuss getting tough on illegal immigration eu ministers are set to discuss fighting illegal immigration into the european union by increasing cross-border police cooperation and data exchange at a three day meeting in berlin .

all this clowning around can mean big business for some but not everyone gets a slice of the cake . every year , in the run up to ash wednesday , massive celebrations take over the carnival capitals cologne and düsseldorf and drum up big business .
priya palsule-desai has the facts : whoever sets foot in germany 's biggest carnival department store , cologne 's " karnevalwierts " , at the beginning of february will get flashbacks of the good old days of winter sales .
clowns and fools elbow their way through plush , glitter and wigs in search of the right costume .
about 15,000 customers a day , come to the store in the weeks running up to rose monday .
although you can buy a costume for under 10 euros , the average carnival die-hard pays an average of about 30 to 50 euros for the right devil 's costume or nurse 's uniform .
toy and sweet industries get carnival boost according to a dresdner bank study , the toy industry made a profit of almost 300 million euros from last year 's carnival , and this seems to be on the up despite an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- this year .
karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

all this clowning around can mean big business for some but not everyone gets a slice of the cake . every year , in the run up to ash wednesday , massive celebrations take over the carnival capitals cologne and düsseldorf and drum up big business .
priya palsule-desai has the facts : whoever sets foot in germany 's biggest carnival department store , cologne 's " karnevalwierts " , at the beginning of february will get flashbacks of the good old days of winter sales .
clowns and fools elbow their way through plush , glitter and wigs in search of the right costume .
about 15,000 customers a day , come to the store in the weeks running up to rose monday .
although you can buy a costume for under 10 euros , the average carnival die-hard pays an average of about 30 to 50 euros for the right devil 's costume or nurse 's uniform .
toy and sweet industries get carnival boost according to a dresdner bank study , the toy industry made a profit of almost 300 million euros from last year 's carnival , and this seems to be on the up despite an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- this year .
karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .

amidst moving into a new apartment in berlin , i had neglected to go grocery shopping .
it was time to head out into the winter morning for some food , but the little vegetable " laden " on the corner was closed , as was the larger supermarket a block away .
panic began to set in as it struck me : it was sunday and nearly all the stores in germany were closed . returning home and mentally drawing up strawberry-pepper recipes , i happened to glance into a small sliver of a storefront called beirut-express .
a nearby tabletop was strewn with fresh mint and the proprietor soon emerged from behind the counter to continue sorting it . seeing me , he came to the entrance and opened up early for a hungry girl .
soon i was enjoying a warm " shawarma " and talking to him about our neighborhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite movements to expand store hours , sundays have mostly remained untouched becoming a local the closest i ’ ve ever been to lebanon is israel , where i peered across the disputed border at the little white villages nestled in distant hills .
even there , lebanon seemed far away , yet i like to think the taste of the country is familiar to me , thanks to the owners of beirut express .
eating at their place , i discovered that they were local figures and their cuisine pulled in loyal regulars .
their son worked there too , and he helped acquaint me with our " kiez , " doling out tips as he carefully dribbled swirls of tahini on my sandwich . when i moved out of the city , i stopped by the shop to tell the family how much i had enjoyed living nearby and they made me promise to visit again next time i was in town . i recently returned to berlin and moved to another part of kreuzberg a couple kilometers away . it took fewer than 48 hours to locate a comparably delicious locale , whose owner , a german citizen with lebanese roots , is equally hospitable .

" the european economy has done remarkably well in 2006 and is set to continue to grow briskly in 2007 , " he said .
" this is not only due to the favorable cyclical conditions .
it also reflects an increased resilience of the european economy and shows that the economic reforms already carried out were worth the effort , " he added . looking more closely at expected 2007 growth trends , almunia said he expected " temporary slowdown " in the first quarter due to an increase in german value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 3 percent increase in german vat could cause a slowdown in eu growth the commission forecast quarterly euro-zone growth of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year , doubling to a rate of about 0.6 percent for the following quarters . inflation prospects better , too not only were growth prospects looking better , the european commission also expected inflation to be lower than when it last issued economic forecasts in november . the commission predicted that annual inflation would be only 1.8 percent this year , down from a november forecast of 2.1 percent and spot on the european central bank 's preferred level of close to but less than two percent . almunia said that the lower inflation expectations were based on a lower oil price forecast of $ 59.90 dollars a barrel instead of $ 66.30 previously and a lower impact from the increase in german vat .
optimistic about germany , italy the commission was particularly optimistic about the growth outlook for germany , raising its 2007 forecast for europe 's biggest economy to 1.8 percent from 1.2 previously . " the revised growth figures suggest that , on the back of booming exports , a solid increase in capital formation -lrb- investment -rrb- and a better functioning labor market , the underlying expansion in economic activity has been more robust than was expected , " the report accompanying the forecasts said . the commission was also upbeat about the prospects for italy , which had gained the reputation in recent years in economic circles of being the " sick man of europe " because of its sluggish performance . it forecast that italy , with the third-biggest economy in the euro zone , would grow 2.0 percent this year , up from a november estimate of 1.4 percent . cloud over france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential race in france is n't necessarily good for the economy however , it cast a cloud over the outlook for growth in france as the country prepares for presidential elections in may , trimming its forecast to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent previously . outside the euro zone , which last month welcomed 13th member slovenia into its ranks , it estimated that the british economy would grow 2.7 percent , up slightly from a forecast of 2.6 percent in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.02.2007 " terrorists today are targeting society itself " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators find it difficult to locate exactly where terrorist threats come from as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past . germany is said to be a hub for would-be terrorists .
in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .

they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

in the 1970s , it was also a breeding ground for terrorists , spawning the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a group of students and intellectuals who committed a series of murders , kidnappings , and bombing as they planned to engineer a communist uprising by the west german working class .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks in the 1970s and 80s . the announcement in germany this week that former raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt will be released from jail after 24 years has again sparked the debate on what motivates terrorists and which groups pose a threat .
dw-radio spoke to german journalist and terror expert elmar thevessen about who the terrorists of today are . elmar thevessen : it 's very difficult to find where the threat is coming from because we now are dealing with probably very young people who are in the middle of society , who are usually not moving in the circles that we used to find them in , for example , in extreme mosques or in groups that have been identified as extremist groups .
they may radicalize themselves through watching pictures on television , they download the ideology from the internet , and they also can download manuals for making bombs from the internet .
so it 's very hard to identify them and to stop them . dw-radio : what is their source of discontent ?
what would motivate somebody to become a terrorist today ? it is becoming a bit clearer .
some of the authorities , for example , in britain , have researched what kind of motivation is driving those people .
they found that there are mainly two big reasons .
one is a perception of discrimination in society .
they feel discriminated against ; they feel they do n't have the same social and economic chances in society .
and the other -lrb- reason -rrb- is a personal perception of a double standard in foreign policy , where the politicians and the government talk about freedom and democracy and all those values , while at the same time a government might participate or support measures like the iraq war or guantanamo or the torture of abu ghraib .
that is a personal perception , but this mix comes together and might drive them into a radicalization , increase the anger , and in the end maybe lead to attacks in the countries where they live . how is that different from the situation in the 1970s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banker alfred herrhausen was killed by the raf in 1989 with regards to the motivation , there 's not such a big difference .
what we saw in the 70s when we had the raf , the left-wing extremists in germany , the terrorists , were driven also by a disaffection with the government , with the establishment , plus also the feeling that they -lrb- had -rrb- to fight against injustices in other parts of the world .
but what is different now is that the terrorists are targeting society itself .
they might choose soft targets , because it 's easier to strike there , and they feel that they can have a big impact if they strike there , whereas the raf , the left-wing extremists and terrorists back in the 70s usually chose targets among the establishment , for example , bankers or leading members of the government . what does it take for a terrorist to become active ?
what drives them over the edge , so they start killing to achieve their aim ? it 's a process .
you can look at cases -lrb- such -rrb- as the killing of theo van gogh , the director and author in the netherlands .
the guy who killed him worked in social programs in the netherlands .
he tried to change the situation for young immigrants .
but he became disaffected for several reasons .
one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .

one reason was that he got the feeling that whatever he -lrb- did -rrb- in this area of society , he -lrb- did n't -rrb- get the support of the government to change the situation for young immigrant .
also , he had a personal feeling that he was discriminated against - he did n't get a job , he did n't have a future before him - so that drove him into disaffection that turned into anger and hatred , because what was added was what happened in the world , where he began to see a double standard in , for example , foreign policy .
in the end , he killed theo van gogh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri was convicted of the 2004 murder of theo van gogh that is something that is very difficult to recognize : where do you have those young people ?
where are the situations where they make decisions to go down the path to extremism ?
that is the place where you would have to stand and come up with arguments in order to stop them -lrb- from taking -rrb- the path to extremism and terrorism .
that is very hard to do . turning to terrorism today in germany , secret service agents here have said that germany is a breeding ground for would-be terrorists , that there are terrorist cells here and they are able to develop .
do you agree ? yes , i agree .
of course , they are taking advantage of the freedom that we have in this society , of the democracy , which , in part in going against them , has a very hard time -lrb- finding -rrb- enough evidence to bring cases to court .
we have an example from last year , where there were some young people who might have planned to blow up a pop concert in germany .
the authorities had some leads .
they investigated them .
they actually arrested them .
they searched their apartments .
they did n't find enough evidence there , but they found that obviously there was kind of a motivational breeding ground there .
that is something that can happen anywhere in germany .
for many of those -lrb- people -rrb- it might lead more to -lrb- the decision -rrb- : we 'll travel to other places where we can fight because we feel a higher obligation to fight there , -lrb- such as -rrb- in iraq or in chechnya .
but those people might also decide at some point to do something in western society , or they might return from iraq , after they have fought there , and they -lrb- use -rrb- their knowledge to build bombs here , and they might plan an attack and maybe execute an attack in germany . would you say germany is too tolerant , too scared of coming down hard on suspected islamist terror for fear of being seen as racist and unjust ? i think there are two problems here .
number one is that it 's very hard to find evidence , because that usually is something that develops in the minds of those people .
since we have freedom of speech , it is very hard to use that as evidence in court .
usually in those cases you do n't have enough .
if you arrest them , if you search their apartments , if you search their computers , you might not actually have enough to get a verdict in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges may not be prepared well to hear terrorism cases number two is the security structure in germany has not adjusted yet to this kind of threat .
you can see in other countries that usually there are courts and judges who have experience in those kinds of cases and who -lrb- deal -rrb- with those cases .
in germany , we do n't have that .
we have , for example , judges who usually come from family law and they might make the decisions in those terrorism cases .
i think what is desperately needed is some expertise on the side of the judicial system in germany in dealing with those cases . it sounds like the terrorist landscape today is vastly different than the terrorist landscape of the 1970s , that the terrorists are far more sophisticated . that is not necessarily so .
what has changed -lrb- is -rrb- that it 's easier to get what you need .
it 's easier to get the manuals to make bombs .
it 's easier to get the material for bombs .
and it might be easier to hide in society , because there are more people who might have the same feelings , the same thoughts , extreme views .
that has changed .
back then you had a -lrb- string -rrb- of attacks , and the raf put out their messages , trying to explain what they wanted to do .
they did that before attacks and continuously , -lrb- while -rrb- the terrorists today do that in secrecy , and they only will talk about the reasons after an attack . so , ironically in an era of freedom of speech , the terrorists are becoming more secretive and harder to identify , while in the old days they were more clearly defined ? yes , it was a little easier to identify them , but the core causes , as i mentioned , are very similar to what we have seen in the 70s .
it also has something to do -lrb- with -rrb- where people are recruited today for the kind of extremism that is the biggest threat right now - basically coming from the same areas where the left-wing extremists recruited their followers in the 70s .
they 're coming from the areas where there are plenty of social problems , where there is no future for young people - at least in their perception - where they have worse chances than others to be successful in a society .
also , as we saw in the 70s , the anti-imperialism that was driving some of the extremists is very similar to what i mentioned as a perception of double standards in foreign policy .
so , the motivational reasons might be very similar , but the methods of the terrorists are different . wilhelmina lyfft interviewed elmar thevessen -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de madrid train bombing trial opens the trial of 29 mainly moroccan suspects in the 2004 madrid train bombings which killed 191 people opens thursday in spain .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .

they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 16.02.2007 opinion : hate speech has nothing to do with freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced holocaust denier ernst zündel to jail for incitement to hatred .
his punishment is appropriate - and no transgression against freedom of speech , according to dw 's daphne antachopoulos . there was no alternative for the court except to hand down the maximum punishment of five years in jail to ernst zündel .
anything else would neither have been commensurate with the german legal system nor with the germans ' understanding of history .
to make it clear from the outset : in germany people are punished for incitement to hatred not only for denying the holocaust , but for contesting the veracity of acts carried out under the nazi dictatorship .
all nazi atrocities are dealt with equally . the holocaust is a historical fact - which zündel explicitly denies .
it is the most intensively researched historical occurrence of the 20th century .
countless documents , photos and witness accounts prove it happened - such as the wannsee conference protocol , which documents exactly how the acts of deportation and annihilation were organized .
the films the allies made in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of concentration camps are also contemporaneous documents .
additional details have also been established in numerous criminal trials and analyses by historians .
thus , by denying the atrocities of the nazi era holocaust deniers like ernst zündel are not expressing an opinion - which possibly would be defensible under the mantel of freedom of expression .
instead it is an allegation that is patently and consciously untrue .
and there , jurisprudence is clear : according to germany 's constitutional court , allegations that have been proven to be false or that the speaker knows to be false are not protected by freedom of expression . people who deny the holocaust do n't do it by accident .
they do it willfully and with a particular aim : to portray the jews ' fate under the nazi dictatorship as a cock-and-bull story , while connecting it to germany 's alleged exploitation for the benefit of the jews . those ideas are consistent with the anti-semitic ideology of the nazis , who chose the jews and other minorities as scapegoats .
in those days , the majority of germans ' did not bridle against this ideology - some tolerated it and looked away , others backed it . dealing with german history was a painful process .
nor can it be brought to a close , in view of the dimensions of the nazis ' crimes .
accounting for the past includes legal action against those who have failed to learn any lessons .
remembrance of the victims and their progeny should be protected as should confidence in the constitutional state which will never again allow such atrocities and their adulation . incidentally , denying the holocaust is not only illegal in germany , but also in france , britain , austria and switzerland .
but due to its history , germany bears the greatest responsibility on the subject .
if no punishment were handed down here , of all places , it would send a fatal signal abroad . but is it right to grant people who use hate speech , such as zündel and his lawyers - some of whom are notorious right-wing extremists themselves - a public forum such as a courtroom ?
or is allowing them a public forum a reason in itself to avoid putting them on trial ? the answer is clear-cut : they should face a court , and they should n't be ignored .
since , turning a blind eye has already had devastating consequences in germany . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

some people are really lucky - they have unannounced , phantom visitors clean and renovate their apartments for them .
if it happened in germany , it could happen anywhere . house chores are essentially tragic : no matter how well you rub and scrub , you know that things are bound to get dirty again .
that 's why cleaning up one 's apartment is an ultimate exercise in futility .
it 's like washing your hair , but with rubber gloves , lots of chemicals and absolutely no sex appeal . cleanliness , like happiness , is but a fleeting moment in time and house chores are there to rub it in your face that life is simply not fair . some people , however , like their house chores .
they say it make them feel centered .
they say it make them feel real .
they also tend to exhibit serious control issues and serve themselves generous portions of anti-depressives for breakfast . wishful thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any takers ?
would n't it be nice , though , if you could come home one day after work , open the door of your apartment and find that everything - literally everything - has been cleaned up for you ? this is what happened to a 45 year old german from frankfurt .
he came home on thursday evening to a sparkling clean apartment : the fridge and the bathroom mirror looked as if they had been visited by mr. clean himself .
a yellow wall in the living room has been painted over in neutral white .
there were no signs of breaking and entering and nothing was missing . so what did the man do ?
did he think how fortunate he was ?
how he , for once , escaped the tiresome routine of quotidian misery ? not this man .
he called the police . why on earth ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another case solved , well done !
some people are very protective of their chores .
they do n't want you to invade their apartments and do their job for them . what if you were some sort of bizarre stalker with a penchant for extreme hygiene , somebody who gets a perverse kick out of cleaning up and renovating other people 's apartments , a twisted believer in the kindness of strangers ? luckily , the frankfurt police were n't born yesterday .
they know how to investigate the crime scene , even when the crime in question is visually pleasing .
the evidence they found was lying inconspicuously on the living room table : a receipt for the cleaning of a different apartment on the same floor .
the workmen had mixed up the apartments and got the wrong set of keys from the landlord . everybody could breathe a big sigh of relief knowing that no underground chore army had been involved . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" " we are trying to help the two germans who disappeared in iraq to return to their families as soon as possible , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday . he said he would not comment on details in the magazine report to protect the pair , who were taken hostage on feb .
6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry said it would not comment on the report for the hostages ' safety despite the political ultimatums , which are a standard part of iraq 's nearly daily kidnappings , the ministry 's crisis team said it still believes the hostages were being held by a resistance group for criminal reasons , according to the spiegel report . the six kidnappers are thought to have close ties to local sunni militias due to the relatively calm abduction .
the kidnappers did not take the woman 's husband , an iraqi professor , hostage and are said to have spoke with other residents in the building . last week , germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de problems arise as germany moves to free hostages in iraq the government 's efforts to secure the release of two germans kidnapped in iraq are complicated by the fact that a key iraqi mediator who helped free former hostages has been left in the lurch by berlin .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .
" it is with great worry that we observe the situation in zimbabwe : the intimidation of political opponents , the hardship , the threats to farmers , the destruction of neighborhoods housing the poor - all of which has absolutely no justification , " merkel told summit participants . merkel criticizes mugabe 's zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has made it clear what he thinks of eu intervention " this is why i launch an appeal to the states bordering zimbabwe to join their forces to ours and make all their influence count to aid the men and women in their suffering , " the german chancellor said . zimbabwe refused to attend the summit because france demanded that the government send someone in place of mugabe , who is banned from traveling to eu member states because of sanctions imposed in 2002 for human rights violations . south african president thabo mbeki and ivory coast president laurent gbagbo are also not attending the cannes summit . nevertheless , 48 of africa 's 53 states are represented in cannes , with many of the leaders coming to say farewell to chirac , who has long been active in nurturing relations with france 's former colonies on the continent . these ties are now being threatened by nationalist movements as well as by the diplomatic and economic inroads by united states and china . merkel said that the european union " will invite the african nations to a summit in the second half of 2007 , " which will be held in portugal , germany 's successor as eu president . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu offers legal jobs to africa in bid to stop illegal immigration the eu is piloting a new guest worker scheme for africa which aims to kill two birds with one stone - boosting the economies of developing countries through foreign wages and stopping illegal immigration in the process .

" i ask all the combatants and the government of sudan ... to accept the deployment of a peace force , to stop all attacks , to respect civilian populations and humanitarian workers , to understand the dead end and horror of a policy for the worst and to choose reconciliation , " chirac said . a civil war has been taking place in darfur since february 2003 , causing some 200,000 deaths and the displacement of at least 2.5 million people . in december , sudanese authorities agreed to let the united nations bring technical and material aid to the peace mission of the african union , but refused to allow the deployment of un peacekeepers . a meeting by leaders of nations concerned by the darfur crisis , including sudanese president omar hasan ahmad al-bashir and chad 's head of state idriss deby , has been tentatively scheduled to take place on the margin of the summit . darfur crisis tops the summit agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by the violence in darfur darfur is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the two-day summit , which is very likely to be chirac 's last , since he is expected to announce soon that he will not stand for another term in this year 's presidential election . some 30 african leaders and german chancellor angela merkel - whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency - joined chirac in cannes to discuss a number of regional problems , such as darfur and the internal crisis in guinea . for her part , merkel called on the neighbors of zimbabwe to put pressure on zimbabwean president robert mugabe to end the hardship caused by his policies .

all this clowning around can mean big business for some but not everyone gets a slice of the cake . every year , in the run up to ash wednesday , massive celebrations take over the carnival capitals cologne and düsseldorf and drum up big business .
priya palsule-desai has the facts : whoever sets foot in germany 's biggest carnival department store , cologne 's " karnevalwierts " , at the beginning of february will get flashbacks of the good old days of winter sales .
clowns and fools elbow their way through plush , glitter and wigs in search of the right costume .
about 15,000 customers a day , come to the store in the weeks running up to rose monday .
although you can buy a costume for under 10 euros , the average carnival die-hard pays an average of about 30 to 50 euros for the right devil 's costume or nurse 's uniform .
toy and sweet industries get carnival boost according to a dresdner bank study , the toy industry made a profit of almost 300 million euros from last year 's carnival , and this seems to be on the up despite an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- this year .
karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

all this clowning around can mean big business for some but not everyone gets a slice of the cake . every year , in the run up to ash wednesday , massive celebrations take over the carnival capitals cologne and düsseldorf and drum up big business .
priya palsule-desai has the facts : whoever sets foot in germany 's biggest carnival department store , cologne 's " karnevalwierts " , at the beginning of february will get flashbacks of the good old days of winter sales .
clowns and fools elbow their way through plush , glitter and wigs in search of the right costume .
about 15,000 customers a day , come to the store in the weeks running up to rose monday .
although you can buy a costume for under 10 euros , the average carnival die-hard pays an average of about 30 to 50 euros for the right devil 's costume or nurse 's uniform .
toy and sweet industries get carnival boost according to a dresdner bank study , the toy industry made a profit of almost 300 million euros from last year 's carnival , and this seems to be on the up despite an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- this year .
karnevalwierts ' manager frank schröder explains why : " the carnival customer is an emotional customer , " he says .
" the proper cologne inhabitant would do anything for carnival .
because here it 's a religion . "
after costumes , sweets are the biggest money-making item - in cologne on rose monday , 150 tonnes of chocolates and sweets , aka " kamelle , " are flung at the crowds watching the parades , and in düsseldorf it 's 60 tonnes .
so what economic significance does carnival have for the sweet industry ?
not that much it would seem .
torben erbrath is a spokesman for the german confectioner 's industry association and explains that " the confectionery industry is a seasonal industry and each season counts .
but carnival does n't even account for one percent of the total turnover . "
" easter and christmas are far ahead , " he says .
" there are , of course , particular companies which have specialised in carnival .
for the branch a whole , carnival does not play a very significant economic role but for individual firms it can affect profits by up to 50 percent or more . "
düsseldorf hotels see a downturn at carnival hotels and restaurants also get a bit extra in their tills at carnival .
according to statistics , about 12,000 extra jobs are created between november and february and mostly in the restaurants located in the old parts of cologne and düsseldorf , where the clownish celebrations are concentrated .
profits soar in these parts , but on the cities ' edges restaurants suffer because there are no customers during carnival .
the same goes for the hotel industry .
during carnival , about 20 percent more people check into hotels in cologne .
the same can not be said about düsseldorf where hotels actually lose custom during carnival .
" düsseldorf has the problem that during carnival business customers stay away but there is n't enough business generated by the carnival itself , " says thorsten helweg who represents the hotel industry in north rhine-westphalia .
" carnival in düsseldorf is big but it remains a regional event as opposed to cologne which people visit from other areas . "
carnival in cologne attracts 1.5 million visitors from all over germany , as well as belgium , france and holland .
the city makes about 330 million euros as a whole during the season and about 8 million of those find their way back to the municipal coffers .
the manager of cologne tourism says that carnival is a " blessing for the city because it represents a fifth season - an extra business opportunity which would not otherwise exist .

the study aimed to assess the scale of drink-spiking in the area and identify problems at specific clubs and pubs .
but the year-long investigation of hospital patients found fewer than one in five showed any trace of drugs .
the research concluded the patients ' symptoms were more likely to be the result of excess alcohol .
so-called " date rape " drugs include ketamine , rohypnol and ghb .
during the 12-month study there were 75 alleged cases of drink-spiking .
patient samples were analysed for alcohol and drug levels , and information was recorded about where the alleged spiking had happened .
the alleged incidents took place in 23 different locations , although two locations accounted for 31 % of the cases .
only 14 % of the patients had informed the police .
the research , which was published in the emergency medicine journal , found 65 % were twice the legal drink-driving limit , and 24 % were three times the drink-drive limit .
the investigation looked at 75 cases of alleged drink-spiking dr peter saul , a gp in wrexham , said the report 's findings " should not belittle the danger " people faced either from drink-spiking or drinking too much alcohol .
he told bbc radio wales : " there had always been a suspicion that people would say that their drinks had been spiked when perhaps they had misjudged how much alcohol they were taking .
" if you go home and your parents are there , and you are vomiting on the path , and you come in in a terrible state , you get sympathy if you say ' oh , my drink was spiked . '
" you do n't get sympathy if you say ' we spent too long in the bar ' . "
dr saul said the report did not make it clear if people 's drinks had been spiked by alcohol , as opposed to drugs .
breathalysing he said : " it could explain the figures of people with very high alcohol levels . "

" if you go home and your parents are there , and you are vomiting on the path , and you come in in a terrible state , you get sympathy if you say ' oh , my drink was spiked . '
" you do n't get sympathy if you say ' we spent too long in the bar ' . "
dr saul said the report did not make it clear if people 's drinks had been spiked by alcohol , as opposed to drugs .
breathalysing he said : " it could explain the figures of people with very high alcohol levels . "
he added : " the message has to be to be careful , not just about having your drink spiked but the total amount of alcohol you have when you are going out for the night . "
professor jonathan shepherd is a cardiff-based surgeon who has pioneered a method for hospital casualty units to compile statistics on the drink-related assaults .
he told the same programme : " it really puts to bed a myth that 's very widely held that drinks are spiked when in reality they are not . "
prof shepherd 's research has included breathalysing up to 900 late-night drinkers in cardiff city centre .
he said : " there is certainly a sizeable minority who are drinking huge amounts of alcohol .
" for all of us , it 's a cautionary tale - we ought to be deciding beforehand how much are going to drink on a night out . "
' precautions ' however , prof shepherd acknowledged that drink-spiking was a still a risk , which he said was easier to prevent by drinking from a bottle rather than a large glass .
dr hywel hughes , who led the study at the wrexham maelor hospital , said the survey 's results should not obscure the risks of drink spiking , as one-in-five people tested showed signs of " drugs of abuse " .
he said : " the bigger picture is probably the alcohol but spiking does go on , so people do need to take precautions against that . "

the study aimed to assess the scale of drink-spiking in the area and identify problems at specific clubs and pubs .
but the year-long investigation of hospital patients found fewer than one in five showed any trace of drugs .
the research concluded the patients ' symptoms were more likely to be the result of excess alcohol .
so-called " date rape " drugs include ketamine , rohypnol and ghb .
during the 12-month study there were 75 alleged cases of drink-spiking .
patient samples were analysed for alcohol and drug levels , and information was recorded about where the alleged spiking had happened .
the alleged incidents took place in 23 different locations , although two locations accounted for 31 % of the cases .
only 14 % of the patients had informed the police .
the research , which was published in the emergency medicine journal , found 65 % were twice the legal drink-driving limit , and 24 % were three times the drink-drive limit .
dr peter saul , a gp in wrexham , said the report 's findings " should not belittle the danger " people faced either from drink-spiking or drinking too much alcohol .
he told bbc radio wales : " there had always been a suspicion that people would say that their drinks had been spiked when perhaps they had misjudged how much alcohol they were taking .

" i wanted to make sure the album was released just before the elections , " says the seven-foot tall , chart-topping rap artist .
" i 'm hoping it will help people to see politicians with different eyes . "
dj xuman 's new album , charged with political lyrics that criticise the current government , also aims to encourage the country 's youth to use their most valuable political weapon - the voting card - in next weekend 's presidential elections .
senegal has been hailed as a bastion of democracy in a region where neighbouring countries have been besieged by civil war , ethnic struggles and religious conflict .
it is proud of its record of freedom of speech , and rap artists - the griots , or oral historians , of the modern age - have often taken advantage of this freedom , producing music imbibed with politically conscious lyrics in order to motivate the youth .
hopes dashed as the technicians lay the high-energy sabar drum beats over his rapid-fire lyrics , xuman remembers what happened during the last presidential elections .
with this new power if you 're not with them , you 're against them dj awadi " in the year 2000 , there were maybe 5,000 rappers and half of them were rapping : ' this system must go . '
" they were telling people : if you really want things to change , make a change .
go and vote - there is no other way . "
and after 40 years of socialist rule , the current president abdoulaye wade 's senegalese democratic party was voted in .
for senegalese rappers , this was their finest hour and a sense of hope filled the country 's youth .
but after seven years , young people now put more hope into migrating to europe via spain 's canary islands .
tens of thousands of senegalese have risked the dangerous boat journeys to escape unemployment and poverty .
and in recent years , say critics , freedom of speech is becoming an increasingly rare commodity in senegal .
radio stations have been shut down for supposedly biased reporting , and most recently , an opposition march in dakar was banned by the government and dispersed with tear gas .
backdated tax rappers , too , complain that the authorities are trying to manipulate the famously critical rap movement for their political gain .
if there was n't this freedom of expression , i am convinced that rap would not be developed in this country momodou kasse information ministry adviser didier awadi is senegal 's most celebrated rapper , with a successful international career .
he remembers being approached by ministers of the new government soon after the last elections , in the hope that he would infuse his music with positive political messages to help the new regime gain popular support .
" i refused and told them : ' my position is still the same .
if you do n't do your job correctly , i will be the first to criticise you , to point it out , " ' he says .
the consequences of such a refusal can be disastrous .
rappers say they have been served with backdated tax bills , and find it difficult to get their songs on the radio or television .
determined this has discouraged rappers from taking up the political campaign trail , as they did in 2000 , and is ultimately , say some , leading to a weakening of the rap movement .
many disillusioned senegalese attempt to migrate this political bullying , says awadi , also threatens the country 's democratic record .
" with this new power , " he complains , " if you 're not with them , you 're against them .
they are here because democracy worked and because there was freedom of speech .
" senegal is used to this kind of thing , we need to talk , we need to express ourselves .
but do n't put us in jail because we do n't like you . "
the government denies that they restrict free speech .
momodou kasse , a technical adviser to the information ministry , says that there are no such restrictions on rap artists ' freedom of expression .
" the fact that the youth have the liberty to say what they think , to speak out loud , and to pass on these messages across the radio , proves that senegal is a democratic country , " he says .
" if there was n't this freedom of expression , i am convinced that rap would not be developed in this country . "
as the polls loom , senegal 's politically motivated rappers are unsure how the rest of the movement 's artists will react to political events .
but awadi says he is determined .
" we all know that these politicians are not serious .
it 's our historical responsibility to be engaged in the real fight against them because we can not accept a regression of democracy in this country .
" we can not accept it . "

" i wanted to make sure the album was released just before the elections , " says the seven-foot tall , chart-topping rap artist .
" i 'm hoping it will help people to see politicians with different eyes . "
dj xuman 's new album , charged with political lyrics that criticise the current government , also aims to encourage the country 's youth to use their most valuable political weapon - the voting card - in next weekend 's presidential elections .
senegal has been hailed as a bastion of democracy in a region where neighbouring countries have been besieged by civil war , ethnic struggles and religious conflict .
it is proud of its record of freedom of speech , and rap artists - the griots , or oral historians , of the modern age - have often taken advantage of this freedom , producing music imbibed with politically conscious lyrics in order to motivate the youth .
hopes dashed as the technicians lay the high-energy sabar drum beats over his rapid-fire lyrics , xuman remembers what happened during the last presidential elections .
with this new power if you 're not with them , you 're against them dj awadi " in the year 2000 , there were maybe 5,000 rappers and half of them were rapping : ' this system must go . '
" they were telling people : if you really want things to change , make a change .
go and vote - there is no other way . "
and after 40 years of socialist rule , the current president abdoulaye wade 's senegalese democratic party was voted in .
for senegalese rappers , this was their finest hour and a sense of hope filled the country 's youth .
but after seven years , young people now put more hope into migrating to europe via spain 's canary islands .
tens of thousands of senegalese have risked the dangerous boat journeys to escape unemployment and poverty .
and in recent years , say critics , freedom of speech is becoming an increasingly rare commodity in senegal .
radio stations have been shut down for supposedly biased reporting , and most recently , an opposition march in dakar was banned by the government and dispersed with tear gas .
backdated tax rappers , too , complain that the authorities are trying to manipulate the famously critical rap movement for their political gain .
if there was n't this freedom of expression , i am convinced that rap would not be developed in this country momodou kasse information ministry adviser didier awadi is senegal 's most celebrated rapper , with a successful international career .
he remembers being approached by ministers of the new government soon after the last elections , in the hope that he would infuse his music with positive political messages to help the new regime gain popular support .
" i refused and told them : ' my position is still the same .
if you do n't do your job correctly , i will be the first to criticise you , to point it out , " ' he says .
the consequences of such a refusal can be disastrous .
rappers say they have been served with backdated tax bills , and find it difficult to get their songs on the radio or television .
determined this has discouraged rappers from taking up the political campaign trail , as they did in 2000 , and is ultimately , say some , leading to a weakening of the rap movement .
many disillusioned senegalese attempt to migrate this political bullying , says awadi , also threatens the country 's democratic record .
" with this new power , " he complains , " if you 're not with them , you 're against them .
they are here because democracy worked and because there was freedom of speech .
" senegal is used to this kind of thing , we need to talk , we need to express ourselves .
but do n't put us in jail because we do n't like you . "
the government denies that they restrict free speech .
momodou kasse , a technical adviser to the information ministry , says that there are no such restrictions on rap artists ' freedom of expression .
" the fact that the youth have the liberty to say what they think , to speak out loud , and to pass on these messages across the radio , proves that senegal is a democratic country , " he says .

simon mann is accused of being the mastermind of a plot to overthrow equatorial guinea 's president in 2004 .
the former sas officer was arrested and jailed in zimbabwe for apparently trying to buy arms as part of the plot .
his lawyer argued the request should be turned down , as he would not receive a fair trail and could face torture .
mann , who is serving a four-year prison term in zimbabwe for buying weapons without a licence , is due to be released in may for good behaviour , reuters news agency reports .
' key person ' " because this case is political , he -lsb- mann -rsb- will not get a fair trial and he will be severely tortured , " mann 's lawyer jonathan samkange told the court . "
the applicant has also given assurances that the death sentence will not be pursued if mr mann is convicted " lawyer joseph jagada twenty-three suspected mercenaries have already been convicted in equatorial guinea in connection with the coup plot .
" others facing the same charges have not received a fair trial , one has died from torture , " he said .
but in a written request to the court , equatorial guinea 's attorney general said it was important that mann answer questions in connection with the conspiracy .
" simon mann is the intellectual head of the mercenary operation and coup plot .
he is the key person who planned and led this operation , " afp news agency quotes jose olo obono as saying .
the lawyer representing the oil-rich state said there was enough evidence to show mann had a " legal case to answer " .
" the applicant has also given assurances that the death sentence will not be pursued if mr mann is convicted , and that he will get a fair trial , " joseph jagada said , reuters reports .
no show mr samkange said his client , who did not appear in court on thursday , was ill and was due to have an unspecified operation soon .
but he said mann was expected to give evidence at later proceedings .
mr mann was arrested in march 2004 for allegedly purchasing weapons in zimbabwe for the planned coup attempt .
more than 60 men arrested with him - most of them south african citizens of angolan origin - were released in 2005 after serving a year 's sentence in zimbabwe .
they flew to zimbabwe from south africa to pick up the weapons and were allegedly on their way to equatorial guinea to meet another group involved in the plot , when both groups were arrested .
sir mark thatcher , son of former uk prime minister now baroness thatcher , was fined and received a suspended sentence in south africa for his involvement in the affair .
the relatives of those being held in equatorial guinea have complained of abuse and unfair treatment .
one suspect , a german , died in prison after what amnesty international said was torture .
equatorial guinea , a former spanish colony , has been ruled by president teodoro obiang nguema since he seized power from his uncle in a coup in 1979 .

simon mann is accused of being the mastermind of a plot to overthrow equatorial guinea 's president in 2004 .
the former sas officer was arrested and jailed in zimbabwe for apparently trying to buy arms as part of the plot .
his lawyer argued the request should be turned down , as he would not receive a fair trail and could face torture .
mann , who is serving a four-year prison term in zimbabwe for buying weapons without a licence , is due to be released in may for good behaviour , reuters news agency reports .
' key person ' " because this case is political , he -lsb- mann -rsb- will not get a fair trial and he will be severely tortured , " mann 's lawyer jonathan samkange told the court .

" others facing the same charges have not received a fair trial , one has died from torture , " he said .
but in a written request to the court , equatorial guinea 's attorney general said it was important that mann answer questions in connection with the conspiracy .
" simon mann is the intellectual head of the mercenary operation and coup plot .
he is the key person who planned and led this operation , " afp news agency quotes jose olo obono as saying .
the lawyer representing the oil-rich state said there was enough evidence to show mann had a " legal case to answer " .

mr mann was arrested in march 2004 for allegedly purchasing weapons in zimbabwe for the planned coup attempt .
more than 60 men arrested with him - most of them south african citizens of angolan origin - were released in 2005 after serving a year 's sentence in zimbabwe .
they flew to zimbabwe from south africa to pick up the weapons and were allegedly on their way to equatorial guinea to meet another group involved in the plot , when both groups were arrested .
sir mark thatcher , son of former uk prime minister now baroness thatcher , was fined and received a suspended sentence in south africa for his involvement in the affair .
the relatives of those being held in equatorial guinea have complained of abuse and unfair treatment .

in most cases the call is made by a woman , or a relative of a woman who is being physically abused by her partner .
domestic violence is spreading rapidly in our society .
black , white , young and old , male and female , domestic violence knows no physical or ethnic boundaries .
more victims of domestic violence are seeking help but , while the number of incidents being reported is on the increase , according to the police that number does not reflect the true extent of the crime that 's taking place behind closed doors .
a new documentary on bbc radio ulster , " to have and to hit " , explores the terrible truth behind some closed doors .
in the documentary , women tell their real life experiences of living with men who mentally and physically abused them .
we also hear the often forgotten victims - the children who suffer regularly too .
the bbc has learned the government is considering introducing legislation which would see the implementation of a register for perpetrators of domestic violence .
it would operate in the same way as a sex offenders register , where names would be made public .
one of the women was crying uncontrollably - she was carrying a small bag of teddy bears , a box of clothes and a photograph album this has received a mixed reaction .
some victims i spoke to were against the idea because they believed they too would be included in the " name and shame game " .
in northern ireland last year , almost 1,100 women of all ages stayed in women 's aid refuges , alongside them over 1,000 children .
often fleeing their homes in the middle of the night , they arrive in one of northern irelands 13 refuges wearing only their pyjamas and carrying a small suitcase with hastily grabbed belongings .
while investigating the issue of domestic violence , i spent an afternoon in a hostel in south belfast .
within a few hours - two women arrived , literally deposited on the doorstep by a taxi driver .
one of the women was crying uncontrollably .
she was carrying a small bag of teddy bears , a box of clothes and a photograph album .
domestic violence knows no physical or ethnic boundaries a support worker called terry , showed her to a small sitting room , put her arms around her and cradled her head as she cried .
her eyes were blackened with smudged make-up and in her hand she held a crumpled white tissue .
the woman , who was in her 20s , left home after her husband had left for work .
she told terry he had had been " punching " her for years .
the refuge will provide her with temporary accommodation until the housing executive re-houses her .
that process could take months .
as a key preventive measure for the future , the government set out education as a tool to tackle the problem .
the bbc has also learned that the government has yet to introduce domestic violence into the curriculum in northern ireland .
the women who told their stories are no longer victims but survivors that is despite pupils in school in england being taught the importance of respecting women and what they should do if they are experiencing violence at home .
in 2005 , the government acknowledged the extent of the problem by publishing a strategy entitled tackling violence at home .
it sent out a clear message - domestic violence is a crime and is not acceptable in any circumstances .
children clearly need help too .
in the documentary , a woman called carol describes how her eight children regularly saw her being punched by her husband - in time they too were struck by their dad .
alongside women 's aid , the nspcc has begun pilot projects where mothers and children can attempt to re-build their relationships .
according to woman 's aid , the programme needs to target boys in particular .
noelle collins , women 's aid team leader , said : " while we are going into schools - we ca n't do it on our own .
myths " we need the backing of government and we need the co-operation of education boards to introduce it into the curriculum . "
the documentary dispels many of the myths behind domestic violence .
it can happen to anyone and unless children are made aware of the issue as young as primary school age - the problem shows no sign of abating .
the women who told us their stories are no longer victims but survivors .
for many , their journey 's not yet over .
but what has emerged through the programme - is that trip could be made a lot sooner if domestic violence programmes were made compulsory in schools and the issue was recognised more as a crime offence .

while investigating the issue of domestic violence , i spent an afternoon in a hostel in south belfast .
within a few hours - two women arrived , literally deposited on the doorstep by a taxi driver .
one of the women was crying uncontrollably .
she was carrying a small bag of teddy bears , a box of clothes and a photograph album .
domestic violence knows no physical or ethnic boundaries a support worker called terry , showed her to a small sitting room , put her arms around her and cradled her head as she cried .
her eyes were blackened with smudged make-up and in her hand she held a crumpled white tissue .
the woman , who was in her 20s , left home after her husband had left for work .
she told terry he had had been " punching " her for years .
the refuge will provide her with temporary accommodation until the housing executive re-houses her .
that process could take months .
as a key preventive measure for the future , the government set out education as a tool to tackle the problem .
the bbc has also learned that the government has yet to introduce domestic violence into the curriculum in northern ireland .
the women who told their stories are no longer victims but survivors that is despite pupils in school in england being taught the importance of respecting women and what they should do if they are experiencing violence at home .
in 2005 , the government acknowledged the extent of the problem by publishing a strategy entitled tackling violence at home .
it sent out a clear message - domestic violence is a crime and is not acceptable in any circumstances .
children clearly need help too .
in the documentary , a woman called carol describes how her eight children regularly saw her being punched by her husband - in time they too were struck by their dad .
alongside women 's aid , the nspcc has begun pilot projects where mothers and children can attempt to re-build their relationships .
according to woman 's aid , the programme needs to target boys in particular .
noelle collins , women 's aid team leader , said : " while we are going into schools - we ca n't do it on our own .
myths " we need the backing of government and we need the co-operation of education boards to introduce it into the curriculum . "
the documentary dispels many of the myths behind domestic violence .
it can happen to anyone and unless children are made aware of the issue as young as primary school age - the problem shows no sign of abating .
the women who told us their stories are no longer victims but survivors .
for many , their journey 's not yet over .
but what has emerged through the programme - is that trip could be made a lot sooner if domestic violence programmes were made compulsory in schools and the issue was recognised more as a crime offence .
helpline number : 0800 917 1414 " to have and to hit " will be broadcast on bbc radio ulster at 1130 gmt on saturday , 17 february and repeated on sunday , 18 february at 1630 gmt .
