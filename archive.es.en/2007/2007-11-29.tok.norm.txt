löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .

" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .

two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .
over the full year , net income increased 21 percent to 4.038 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . spreading patchwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has the highest number of a single-parent families another noticeable change over the last 10 years has been a 30-percent increase in the number of single parents and non-married parents to 2.3 million - again with a concentration of 42 percent in eastern germany compared to 22 in the west . " this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork . "
in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .
the same would be true for palestinian president abbas . " bildunterschrift : the us should ease the pressure , wrote several european papers the repubblica in rome agreed : " if the unpopular politicians ehud olmert and mahmud abbas really manage in 2008 , together with the ' lame duck ' george w. bush in the white house , to redraw the map of the middle east - namely , with lasting peace - then their people would certainly respond positively . " paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .
here there are partners , and majorities among the israelis and palestinians that are for peace and democracy . -lsb- … -rsb- at least olmert and abbas speak the same language . " nevertheless , the paper questioned the feasibility of the new plan to establish peace at the end of 2008 : " why should in 12 months that be possible which has n't happened in the seven years since camp david , 14 years since oslo and 16 years since the peace conference in madrid ? " " american pressure alone wo n't do it , " the german daily concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : why should the annapolis summit be any different ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .

the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .

mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .

what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .

in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .
the same would be true for palestinian president abbas . " bildunterschrift : the us should ease the pressure , wrote several european papers the repubblica in rome agreed : " if the unpopular politicians ehud olmert and mahmud abbas really manage in 2008 , together with the ' lame duck ' george w. bush in the white house , to redraw the map of the middle east - namely , with lasting peace - then their people would certainly respond positively . " paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .
here there are partners , and majorities among the israelis and palestinians that are for peace and democracy . -lsb- … -rsb- at least olmert and abbas speak the same language . " nevertheless , the paper questioned the feasibility of the new plan to establish peace at the end of 2008 : " why should in 12 months that be possible which has n't happened in the seven years since camp david , 14 years since oslo and 16 years since the peace conference in madrid ? " " american pressure alone wo n't do it , " the german daily concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent .

the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

29 , that its members tighten gun control and establish an extensive firearms database . the european commission on thursday urged the 27-member bloc to adopt a set of minimum rules that would ban anyone under 18 from purchasing or possessing a gun .
an exception would be made for minors involved in hunting or target shooting under the supervision of an adult . the move comes just several weeks after eight people were killed when an 18-year-old high school student opened fire in a classroom in finland .
the incident sparked copycat threats , including several in germany , and discussion on gun control in the scandinavian country and through the european union . " recent dramatic events have shown just how necessary it is to better control the purchase and circulation of arms , " said commission vice-president gunter verheugen of germany . firearm database planned in addition to making the age-limit more rigid , the eu wants its member states by 2014 to set up computerized databanks containing detailed information on each firearm and the names and addresses of both the supplier and buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finnish gunman had announced his plans on the internet beforehand the data would be accessible to police and judicial authorities and would be kept on file for 20 years . the nov .
7 shooting in southern finland served to shift public opinion in a country that has the third highest gun-possession rate in the world , behind the us and yemen .
the current legal age to apply for a gun license is 15 , but officials have already said the country is prepared to raise the age to 18 . critics of the eu ruling point out that the finnish gunman was 18 and had a license for his 22-caliber pistol . " i 'm not sure -lsb- the directive -rsb- will be helpful , " ville itala , a finnish parliamentarian and former police chief , told bbc news .
" from my own point of view , it was a mistake that police had n't looked into his background . " eu justice ministers are expected to discuss the bill next week in brussels .
the new law still needs to be approved by the member states and would go in effect in january , said the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .

" this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork . "
in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime .

the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say security is threatened .

-lrb- 09.11.2007 -rrb- eu ministers open up nine new countries to visa-free travel border controls will become a hassle of the past for nine more european countries as eu interior ministers agreed to expand the schengen free-movement to the south and east at a meeting in brussels .

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 .
" we want to be world leader in terms of profitability , " löscher told a press conference on thursday , nov .
29 .
in the fiscal year 2007 , siemens posted a diluted eps from continued operations of 3.99 euros .
including discontinued operations , eps came in at 4.10 euros in the 2007 fiscal year .
löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is hoping to become more flexible and less bureaucratic the management board will be slimmed down from 11 members to eight from jan .

a total of five directors are expected to leave .
the industry sector will be headed by current siemens board member heinrich hiesinger ; the energy sector will be placed in the charge of current siemens vdo automotive ceo wolfgang dehen ; and the health care sector will be taken over by board member erich reinhardt .
" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .
shaken by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens employs about 450,000 workers in more than 190 countries the munich-based company , one of germany 's biggest , has been shaken by a corruption scandal in which 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in dubious payments were reportedly made to secure orders in nigeria , russia and libya .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .
the same would be true for palestinian president abbas . " bildunterschrift : the us should ease the pressure , wrote several european papers the repubblica in rome agreed : " if the unpopular politicians ehud olmert and mahmud abbas really manage in 2008 , together with the ' lame duck ' george w. bush in the white house , to redraw the map of the middle east - namely , with lasting peace - then their people would certainly respond positively . " paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .
here there are partners , and majorities among the israelis and palestinians that are for peace and democracy . -lsb- … -rsb- at least olmert and abbas speak the same language . " nevertheless , the paper questioned the feasibility of the new plan to establish peace at the end of 2008 : " why should in 12 months that be possible which has n't happened in the seven years since camp david , 14 years since oslo and 16 years since the peace conference in madrid ?

including discontinued operations , eps came in at 4.10 euros in the 2007 fiscal year .
löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .

a total of five directors are expected to leave .
the industry sector will be headed by current siemens board member heinrich hiesinger ; the energy sector will be placed in the charge of current siemens vdo automotive ceo wolfgang dehen ; and the health care sector will be taken over by board member erich reinhardt .
" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .

two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .
over the full year , net income increased 21 percent to 4.038 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incident sparked copycat threats , including several in germany , and discussion on gun control in the scandinavian country and through the european union . " recent dramatic events have shown just how necessary it is to better control the purchase and circulation of arms , " said commission vice-president gunter verheugen of germany . firearm database planned in addition to making the age-limit more rigid , the eu wants its member states by 2014 to set up computerized databanks containing detailed information on each firearm and the names and addresses of both the supplier and buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finnish gunman had announced his plans on the internet beforehand the data would be accessible to police and judicial authorities and would be kept on file for 20 years . the nov .
7 shooting in southern finland served to shift public opinion in a country that has the third highest gun-possession rate in the world , behind the us and yemen .
the current legal age to apply for a gun license is 15 , but officials have already said the country is prepared to raise the age to 18 . critics of the eu ruling point out that the finnish gunman was 18 and had a license for his 22-caliber pistol . " i 'm not sure -lsb- the directive -rsb- will be helpful , " ville itala , a finnish parliamentarian and former police chief , told bbc news .
" from my own point of view , it was a mistake that police had n't looked into his background . " eu justice ministers are expected to discuss the bill next week in brussels .
the new law still needs to be approved by the member states and would go in effect in january , said the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

in the fiscal year 2007 , siemens posted a diluted eps from continued operations of 3.99 euros .
including discontinued operations , eps came in at 4.10 euros in the 2007 fiscal year .
löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .

a total of five directors are expected to leave .
the industry sector will be headed by current siemens board member heinrich hiesinger ; the energy sector will be placed in the charge of current siemens vdo automotive ceo wolfgang dehen ; and the health care sector will be taken over by board member erich reinhardt .
" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .
shaken by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens employs about 450,000 workers in more than 190 countries the munich-based company , one of germany 's biggest , has been shaken by a corruption scandal in which 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in dubious payments were reportedly made to secure orders in nigeria , russia and libya .
two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .

" paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . spreading patchwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has the highest number of a single-parent families another noticeable change over the last 10 years has been a 30-percent increase in the number of single parents and non-married parents to 2.3 million - again with a concentration of 42 percent in eastern germany compared to 22 in the west . " this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork . "
in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

in the fiscal year 2007 , siemens posted a diluted eps from continued operations of 3.99 euros .
including discontinued operations , eps came in at 4.10 euros in the 2007 fiscal year .
löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .

a total of five directors are expected to leave .
the industry sector will be headed by current siemens board member heinrich hiesinger ; the energy sector will be placed in the charge of current siemens vdo automotive ceo wolfgang dehen ; and the health care sector will be taken over by board member erich reinhardt .
" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .

two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .
how will the expansion of the schengen area affect the work of the border patrol on poland 's eastern border ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland will soon take germany 's place as the eastern-most schengen country there will be no significant changes with the border crossings on the eastern border .
border inspections will be carried out just as they are now .
only the so-called " green border " will be sealed up to reduce illegal activity to a minimum .
in addition , new institutions will be set up that will deal directly with security on the national border . german border patrol officers are concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs , though the disappearance of the borders does not mean the abolition of the patrol , rather a change of task .
should polish border patrol officers fear for their jobs after dec .
21 ? border guards wo n't be dismissed due to the disappearance of the internal eu borders .
there wo n't be any transfers at the eastern border either , but if somebody wants to work on the eastern border that would be possible .
officers from border crossings where inspections will no longer be carried out will be given other tasks or become part of the mobile patrols . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .
the same would be true for palestinian president abbas . " bildunterschrift : the us should ease the pressure , wrote several european papers the repubblica in rome agreed : " if the unpopular politicians ehud olmert and mahmud abbas really manage in 2008 , together with the ' lame duck ' george w. bush in the white house , to redraw the map of the middle east - namely , with lasting peace - then their people would certainly respond positively . " paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .
here there are partners , and majorities among the israelis and palestinians that are for peace and democracy . -lsb- … -rsb- at least olmert and abbas speak the same language . " nevertheless , the paper questioned the feasibility of the new plan to establish peace at the end of 2008 : " why should in 12 months that be possible which has n't happened in the seven years since camp david , 14 years since oslo and 16 years since the peace conference in madrid ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 29.11.2007 enriched uranium seized in slovakia suitable for dirty bomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the material seized was enriched enough to be used in a radiological " dirty bomb " slovakian police arrested three traffickers near the hungarian border who were smuggling almost half a kilo -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- of enriched uranium that could be used for making a " dirty bomb , " officials said on thursday , nov .
30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israelis and palestinians have pledged to forge peace within a year , but major european newspapers wondered if it will be possible . the annapolis peace summit , held on the invitation of us president george w. bush , " can be seen as a break-though that after a long period of one-sided steps and coincidental contact , " wrote volksrant on thursday , nov .
29 , from the hague . however , " it 's very important that the americans -lsb- … -rsb- keep the pressure down , " the dutch paper continued .
" it 's the israelis and the palestinians that have to make peace . " switzerland 's zürich-based neue zürcher zeitung disagreed that the summit , which took place on tuesday and wednesday , could be called a " break-though . "
" but it can still be considered progress , " the paper conceded .
" it 's more than the pessimists predicted before the annapolis summit . -lsb- … -rsb- if olmert sticks to the path set in annapolis , he has a good chance of gaining political capital and new respect from the shaken , wavering israeli public .
the same would be true for palestinian president abbas . " bildunterschrift : the us should ease the pressure , wrote several european papers the repubblica in rome agreed : " if the unpopular politicians ehud olmert and mahmud abbas really manage in 2008 , together with the ' lame duck ' george w. bush in the white house , to redraw the map of the middle east - namely , with lasting peace - then their people would certainly respond positively . " paris ' le monde was more skeptical , emphasizing the " weakness " and " incredibility " of both olmert and abbas . " the division of the palestinian territories in the gaza strip - which is controlled by hamas - and the west bank - where , theoretically , abbas ' fatah has administrative power - is a burden on the beginning of a peace process , " commented the french paper .
" and in israel the coalition wo n't hold out for long once the negotiations start getting serious .
the ' peace camp ' in israel disappeared long ago . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung opined that " of all the problems in the region , the middle east conflict seems to be , relatively speaking , the most likely to be resolved .
here there are partners , and majorities among the israelis and palestinians that are for peace and democracy . -lsb- … -rsb- at least olmert and abbas speak the same language . " nevertheless , the paper questioned the feasibility of the new plan to establish peace at the end of 2008 : " why should in 12 months that be possible which has n't happened in the seven years since camp david , 14 years since oslo and 16 years since the peace conference in madrid ? " " american pressure alone wo n't do it , " the german daily concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : why should the annapolis summit be any different ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .
a hefty sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some europeans fear that terrorist could use a dirty bomb for an attack the suspects - two hungarians and one ukrainian - were detained at a hungarian-slovak border crossing on their way to a meeting where they were planning to sell the material at $ 3,500 -lrb- 2357 euros -rrb- per gram or $ 1.7 million in total . " police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
uranium must be enriched to contain at least 85 percent of the u-235 isotope in order to be weapons grade . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . " according to preliminary information , the material could have been used to make a so-called dirty bomb , " senior police official michal kopcik told a news conference .
a dirty bomb refers to a weapon in which radioactive material is packed with conventional explosives and scattered over a wide area upon detonation .
the seized package of the naturally occurring uranium-238 isotope as well as uranium-235 - the type used in nuclear reactors and in nuclear warheads - contained 481.4 grams -lrb- 17 ounces -rrb- of radioactive material .
" the radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form , " kopcik explained .
the slovak authorities did not reveal how enriched the uranium was , but the amount of money that was reportedly asked for the material has raised suspicions that its concentration was relatively high .

" police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers , " kopcik said without disclosing more information about the buyers .
this was not the first time that a shipment of enriched uranium was intercepted in eastern europe .
in 2004 , two former slovak army officers were convicted by a czech court for trying to sell uranium .
they were arrested in november 2003 at a hotel outside of brno after they tried to sell three kilograms of the substance .
radioactive trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal trade in radioactive materials poses a serious danger to security the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , a watchdog for the nuclear industry , says it has recorded 1,250 cases of smuggling and other incidents related to the handling of radioactive material since the 1990s .
richard hoskins , an iaea official who administers the tracking database , told the ap news agency that " there are far too many incidents of material not being properly controlled . "
" if we can do a better job , we can help keep these materials from falling into terrorist hands , " hoskins said .
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .

in the fiscal year 2007 , siemens posted a diluted eps from continued operations of 3.99 euros .
including discontinued operations , eps came in at 4.10 euros in the 2007 fiscal year .
löscher - who took over the job in july in the midst of a massive investigation into bribery allegations at the top of the german industrial concern - said siemens only planned " smaller acquisitions and disposals " to bolster the company 's fastest-growing businesses .
" the focus now needs to be on organic growth , " he said .
a new beginning löscher 's comments came after siemens announced on wednesday that the company would be reorganized into three branches covering industrial goods , energy and medical technology , each with its own chief executive .

a total of five directors are expected to leave .
the industry sector will be headed by current siemens board member heinrich hiesinger ; the energy sector will be placed in the charge of current siemens vdo automotive ceo wolfgang dehen ; and the health care sector will be taken over by board member erich reinhardt .
" after a year of far-reaching changes and a new leadership and organizational structure , we have laid the foundations for the next successful chapter in the concern 's 160-year history , " supervisory board chairman gerhard cromme said .

two former siemens managers in the power-generation division received suspended sentences from a german court in may related to the payment of more than 6 million euros in bribes to two managers of the italian energy concern enel with the aim of securing contracts for siemens gas turbines .
the company , which agreed to pay 201 million euros to end the corruption probe , said the restructuring into three branches with 15 divisions would increase siemens ' ability to compete with its rivals on the global market .
earlier this month , siemens reported a fourth-quarter fiscal loss of 74 million euros .

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .

" this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork . "
in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.11.2007 opinion : winds have changed in eu-chinese ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the eu 's climate protection loan and new commitments to solving trade and currency disputes , mutual disappointment marked the eu-china summit in beijing , said dw 's matthias von hein . though it did n't take center-stage at the summit , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's complaint in the presence of chinese vice prime minister wu yi about the lack of security in chinese products revealed just how wide the rift is between both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein in defense , wu yi said that 99 percent of chinese exports to the eu were safe .
with an export volume worth some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 444 billion -rrb- , just 1 percent of dangerous goods was too much , countered mandelson . it 's a familiar situation : china feels misunderstood and unappreciated .
the eu then erroneously assumes it just needs to give beijing a few tips and the country will do a 180-degree turn - all the way down to the last rural village . disappointments are weighing heavy on both sides - even though the delegates smiled for the tv cameras at the summit .
the winds have turned in the eu 's relationship with china .
it may not quite be on the rocks , but the conflict is there . in the past 12 months , the european commission alone has sent china three documents with titles like " competition and partnership " and made particularly critical statements about its asian partner . a major reason is the eu 's rapidly growing trade deficit with china , which is expected to rise to 170 billion euros this year .
this is happening as a third of the containers routed to china from the port in hamburg are empty . other points are the large-scale pirating of technology by chinese companies and continued human rights violations . the eu has been accusing china , with ever increasing clarity , of profiting from the openness of the european markets without ensuring fair conditions in the chinese market . in addition , china 's image across europe has suffered from reports of widespread industrial espionage and hacking attempts on the german chancellery . europe has traditionally depended on discourse and diplomacy in its dealings with china . the us , on the other hand , has always used pressure to accomplish its interests in china .
frustrated with a lack of results , the eu has started using a more forceful tone as well . in beijing , the europeans warned that the trend toward protectionism , given the chinese trade surplus , is becoming stronger . the decision to create two working groups to examine the sensitive topics of trade and currency can be seen as just a timid sign of readiness to cooperate .
and the eu 's 500-million-euro loan for climate protection is , considering the breadth of china 's environmental sins , hardly more than a gesture . the mutual disappointment , however , will perhaps be helpful in the end : taking a sober look at the other side can allow for solid and sustainable politics . matthias von hein is the director of dw-radio 's chinese program -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.11.2007 new book sheds light on us space dreamer 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood german-us rocket engineer wernher von braun developed the saturn v launch vehicle that put the first man on the moon in 1969 .
but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent .

" this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork .

the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.11.2007 polish border guard : we 're ready for schengen challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's schengen membership comes three and a half years after it joined the eu just weeks before poland joins the visa-free schengen area , dw-world.de spoke with a spokesman of the polish border patrol about the disappearance of europe 's internal borders - and german concerns . on dec .
21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .

meanwhile , the number of patchwork families is increasing - especially in the eastern states . according to a new survey carried out by the federal statistics office , germany has experienced a major shift in family structures over the last 10 years . the results show that the number of families with at least one child under 18 dropped by 7 percent to 8.8 million between 1996 and 2006 , with the steepest decline - a 28 percent drop - in the eastern part of the country .
while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .

" this results in a shift in family structures , " said walter radermacher , president of the federal statistics office . the highest density is in the capital , where at 47 percent , almost half of the city 's 330,000 families are " patchwork . "
in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

but he could never escape his nazi past , according to a newly published biography . he was a giant of the space age in the 20th century , and best known to postwar baby boomers for selling the idea of interplanetary travel on disney television shows across north america .
born to prussian aristocrats in 1912 , wernher magnus freiherr von braun was obsessed with spaceflight as a boy and became the third reich 's wunderkind technocrat whose infamous v-2 rockets rained over london and antwerp during world war ii , killing thousands of civilians . but it was the use of slave labor to assemble those v-2s that has led critics to brand him as a war criminal .
over 20,000 died in the underground plants at dora-mittelwerk , south of the harz mountains and elsewhere in the reich 's eastern territories .
when it became clear that nazi germany 's days were numbered , von braun surrendered to the us occupying forces .
the army 's top brass had valued his technical leadership for the v-2 so highly that they ignored von braun 's ss membership and ties to hitler 's inner circle .
in a covert operation called project paperclip , they evacuated the german v-2 team to fort bliss in texas to work on the pentagon 's emerging guided missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun 's crowning achievement was the apollo moon landing in 1969 in 1957 , the soviets launched sputnik , the first man-made satellite in space , thereby shattering america 's sense of invulnerability .
three months later , the us countered with von braun 's explorer i , and the space race between the two mighty cold war adversaries was on .
little more than a decade later , von braun realized his boyhood dream on july 20 , 1969 when apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon .
von braun died of cancer in 1977 . dw-world.de spoke to michael j. neufeld , 56 , the author of " von braun : dreamer of space / engineer of war " about the man , who has been either vilified as a nazi scientist or glorified as a space pioneer .
the reality , according to neufeld , who is also chair of space history at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington dc , is not quite so black and white . dw-world.de : you were a space buff and von braun fan watching those disney shows when you were younger .
how has your perception of the man evolved over the decades ? in the late 1970s , there was a rising consciousness about the holocaust .
then the memoirs of a french resistance fighter , who survived the mittelwerk-dora labor camp , were translated into english and shed light on the horrors of the v-2 rocket program .
but the turning point was when the arthur rudolph case broke in 1984 . arthur rudolph was the former production chief of mittelwerk-dora , who emigrated to the us with von braun and became the project director of the moon rocket saturn v. yes .
eli rosenbaum , a junior lawyer in the us justice department 's new nazi hunting unit , had access to the project paperclip records and rudolph was the best case they had to prosecute .
in the end , rather than face a deportation hearing , rudolph renounced his us citizenship and " voluntarily " left for west germany . luckily , von braun was no longer alive to face charges himself , but his posthumous reputation was severely damaged . how was von braun any different from his good friend rudolph ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20,000 slave laborers who assembled the v-2 rockets perished rudolph was a true nazi believer .
he had been a party member since 1931 , and the nature of his job at mittelwerk-dora meant that he had much more involvement with concentration camp labor than von braun .
von braun was a mitläufer , a fellow traveler , who joined the ss to further his career .
he did n't exactly embrace the regime and there was no evidence of him being an anti-semite , but he was happy to overlook the downside of a totalitarian state because it had served him so well .
von braun was consumed by rocketry and an ambition to go into space , so he made this faustian bargain with the third reich .
they said : " we give you the money , power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes . " when it was clear germany was going to lose the war in the summer of 1944 , your book quotes von braun saying that he suddenly realized that he " might be aiding an evil regime . " rather late , was n't it ? yes , but only in hindsight .
we have a different historical perspective today .
one needs to understand the motivations of the historical players at the time and see their world view back then .
the breaking point for von braun was towards the end of the war when he was arrested by the gestapo , and became the target of the regime 's repressive tactics himself . he was arrested for off-the-cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the führer , something that his pr handlers played up later in the american phase of his life .
but his v-2s killed thousands in london . the moral controversy about von braun is misplaced .
the anglo-american bombers killed many more civilians than the v-2 did . this was war .
the issue is what kind of moral compromises he made knowing the kind of regime he was serving .
von braun was so opportunistic . something that became evident at the end of the war when he switched sides ... germany was dead in 1945 , so one 's perspective changes rapidly . the us wanted von braun badly enough to overlook his nazi past .
why was he so valuable to the us military ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von braun -lrb- middle -rrb- focused on the space race to the moon under us president john f. kennedy -lrb- right -rrb- von braun was a brilliant engineer and visionary , but his biggest talent was in directing and mobilizing huge engineering teams like the maestro of an orchestra .
rocket technology was at the cutting edge of guided missile work and became a major part of the us weapons development program .
the americans picked up on the v-2 technology and ran with it . to what extent did von braun 's family cooperate with you on the biography ? his widow and children wo n't talk to any historian or journalist .
the german children of von braun 's elder brother , sigismund , on the other hand , were very forthcoming .
this might have to do with the fact that sigismund was an anti-nazi in a quiet way .
during the war , he was germany 's consul in the vatican , a neutral state during the war , and he took considerable risks in issuing exit visas to jews seeking to escape the nazi-occupied areas in northern italy . there have been so many biographies of von braun in german and english .
why yet another one now ? my blunt opinion is that the other bios are either poor or lacking in balance .
they 're either virulently anti-braun or worship him as a hero - all very black or white . so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal ? i did n't want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message .

21 , nine of the states that joined the eu in 2004 - including poland - will become part of the schengen agreement .
that means visa-free travel for tourists and businesspeople within the expanded area .
the disappearance of internal eu frontiers also results in a revised mandate for the border police in the affected countries . while they will continue to combat smuggling and illegal immigration , the border police will work in mobile units within their respective countries instead of on the actual border .
the polish border patrol has said it will also be responsible for fighting drug trade and preventing cultural relics from being illegally removed from the country . members of germany 's federal police , which is in charge of guarding the borders , held demonstrations last weekend near the polish border to protest the move , saying it was premature .
they have criticized the security situation in poland , which shares a 460-kilometer -lrb- 286-mile -rrb- border with germany , but have also expressed uncertainty over the future of their jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and polish border police have been working together for years jacek sonta , public communications director for the polish border patrol , told dw-world.de what will change with his country 's admission to the schengen area . dw-world.de : what do you think about the worries of the german border police regarding poland 's entry into the schengen area ? it 's difficult for me to comment on the fears of the german police officers regarding our country 's accession to the schengen area .
however , i can assure you that the border patrol cooperation between poland and german is great .
proof of that is also the opening of a new joint institution in swiecko -lsb- a town on the german-polish border -rsb- on dec .
17 . how has the polish border patrol prepared itself for the disappearance of the internal borders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes are cheaper in eastern europe in preparing for the responsibilities that go along with being a member of the schengen area , the polish border patrol started working out a concept to adapt its structure to the new conditions .
the concept was n't only developed based on our own experiences , but also on those of other members of the european union that already act as part of the schengen area .
to improve operations , the current polish border patrol has expanded the number and activity of its mobile patrols in the border region and within our country . in the future , mobile patrols are to be implemented instead of checks at the border .
will this method be successful ? the previous range of operation has been expanded to include regions beyond the border area , which allows for activity on a larger territory .
mobile patrols will ultimately conduct inspections and investigate whether certain individuals are registered as wanted within the eu .
inspections within the country will be an indispensable component of our security system .
remember that the german border guard 's fight against illegal immigration into the eu has taken place under other conditions : poland 's eastern and western borders constituted a rather effective barrier against illegal migration from the east .
now , the polish border guard will be the only one to guarantee that the eu 's eastern border remains impermeable .
that 's why the operations of the mobile patrols across all of poland will be essential . the polish border patrol 's web site states that combating smuggling will remain an important task .
what kinds of things are most frequently smuggled into poland ? the most frequent illegally smuggled goods are cigarettes are alcohol .
the difference in the price of these items in eastern and western europe makes them one of the most popular things to smuggle across the border .
most of the deliveries , however , are stopped by the polish border guard or other institutions and do n't reach the market . poland borders two countries to the east - belarus and ukraine - that are neither part of schengen nor the eu .

while the highest share of the country 's people living in traditional families -lrb- 42 percent -rrb- are in baden-württemberg in southern germany , the lowest concentration is in saxony in the east , home to only 31 percent . " this tells us that we need to take better care of families , " said family minister ursula von der leyen in berlin on wednesday , nov .

in baden-württemberg , meanwhile , four of five families consist of married parents . economic factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families with more than one child are becoming less common in germany the number of children per family is also falling , with the trend to smaller families showing no sign of abating . most families -lrb- 53 percent -rrb- have one child , 36 percent have two and a mere 11 percent have three children or more .
the average german family now has 1.61 children compared to 1.65 10 years ago . possible reasons for this development include financial worries in regions where unemployment is high , and the ongoing exodus of young women from eastern germany . " it 's now up to the politicians to find the causes behind this disintegration of the family model and come up with new ways of countering the trend , " said radermacher .

dr peter kirkbride , the chief spokesman on radiotherapy for the nhs , said the nhs spent £ 100m on the breast cancer drug herceptin in 2006 .
but he told radio 4 's the investigation only about 500 patients had benefited - at a cost of about £ 200,000 each .
if that was spent on radiotherapy , it could have a dramatic impact , he said . "
there is a lot of publicity about the role of chemotherapy but the consensus is of all cancers that are cured , half are cured by surgeries , 40 % by radiotherapy and only 10 % by drugs " dr peter kirkbride national clinical lead for radiotherapy cancer survival in the uk is still below the european average , despite recent improvements .
herceptin was approved for use in women with early stage breast cancer in 2006 after a fast-track assessment by the national institute for health and clinical excellence .
but now some cancer doctors are concerned this focus on new cancer drugs may not be a good thing .
dr kirkbride said : " there is a lot of publicity about the role of chemotherapy but the consensus is of all cancers that are cured , half are cured by surgeries , 40 % by radiotherapy and only 10 % by drugs .
" if i was to spend £ 100m on radiotherapy , i could buy something like 90 machines , i could buy 30 simulators and i could probably benefit about 30,000 patients for the same amount of money . "
radiotherapy problems earlier this year , the national radiotherapy advisory group published a report which called for a 91 % increase in radiotherapy treatments in england in the next 10 years .
but the trade body for the manufacturers of radiotherapy machines has told the bbc that instead of seeing more business , it has all but dried up .
david miles , the chairman of the radiotherapy specialist focus group of the association of x-ray equipment manufacturers which formed to highlight the problem , says there has been a " collapse in critical investment " .
he said : " we noticed after the government initiatives to improve the established stock of radiotherapy equipment , it actually ended in april last year .
and the sales of machines then fell off drastically .
" one order has been placed in the last 20 months . "
because it takes around three years from when an order is first placed until it treats its first patient , the radiotherapy focus group at axrem says the nhs should have bought 20 replacements machines by now instead of just one .
' not sexy enough ' dr kirkbride thinks part of the problem is raising the discipline 's profile in the eyes of both the public and government .
he said : " we are not sexy enough .
we do n't have pharmaceutical companies backing us in the same way that some of the drugs companies support campaigns for the use of their drugs . "
professor mike richards , the national cancer director , said there should be room in the cancer budget for both .
he said : " there is no doubt that herceptin is a good drug .
there is no doubt that it has been looked at carefully by nice and it has been deemed to be both effective and cost-effective .
" radiotherapy is also effective and we need to make sure that it 's not one or the other , but that we actually have a service that delivers both . "

herceptin was approved for use in women with early stage breast cancer in 2006 after a fast-track assessment by the national institute for health and clinical excellence .
but now some cancer doctors are concerned this focus on new cancer drugs may not be a good thing .
dr kirkbride said : " there is a lot of publicity about the role of chemotherapy but the consensus is of all cancers that are cured , half are cured by surgeries , 40 % by radiotherapy and only 10 % by drugs .
" if i was to spend £ 100m on radiotherapy , i could buy something like 90 machines , i could buy 30 simulators and i could probably benefit about 30,000 patients for the same amount of money . "
radiotherapy problems earlier this year , the national radiotherapy advisory group published a report which called for a 91 % increase in radiotherapy treatments in england in the next 10 years .
but the trade body for the manufacturers of radiotherapy machines has told the bbc that instead of seeing more business , it has all but dried up .
david miles , the chairman of the radiotherapy specialist focus group of the association of x-ray equipment manufacturers which formed to highlight the problem , says there has been a " collapse in critical investment " .
he said : " we noticed after the government initiatives to improve the established stock of radiotherapy equipment , it actually ended in april last year .
and the sales of machines then fell off drastically .
" one order has been placed in the last 20 months . "
because it takes around three years from when an order is first placed until it treats its first patient , the radiotherapy focus group at axrem says the nhs should have bought 20 replacements machines by now instead of just one .
' not sexy enough ' dr kirkbride thinks part of the problem is raising the discipline 's profile in the eyes of both the public and government .
he said : " we are not sexy enough .
we do n't have pharmaceutical companies backing us in the same way that some of the drugs companies support campaigns for the use of their drugs . "
professor mike richards , the national cancer director , said there should be room in the cancer budget for both .
he said : " there is no doubt that herceptin is a good drug .
there is no doubt that it has been looked at carefully by nice and it has been deemed to be both effective and cost-effective .
" radiotherapy is also effective and we need to make sure that it 's not one or the other , but that we actually have a service that delivers both . "

a spokeswoman for the theatres said performances would resume on thursday .
the agreement came after two days of marathon talks between the strikers , the theatres and producers .
all but eight broadway productions were shut down after stagehands walked out in a dispute over pay and conditions on 10 november .
the strike followed three months of talks , centring on how many stagehands are needed to open a production and keep it running smoothly during the life of a show .
the union wants a fixed number while producers want a flexible number .
negotiations were held with producers , who are anxious to curtail mounting losses at the box office .
economic impact " the contract is a good compromise that serves our industry .
what is most important is that broadway 's lights will once again shine brightly , " charlotte st martin , head of the league of american theatres and producers said .
" the people of broadway are looking forward to returning to work , giving the theatre-going public the joy of broadway , the greatest entertainment in the world , " james claffey , president of stagehands ' union local one said .
the two sides were under pressure to reach a compromise as other unions , including the actors ' equity union , felt the bite of losing pay .
the economic impact of the strike , which has also hit dining out and shopping , has been estimated at $ 2m -lrb- £ 968,000 -rrb- each day .
the last strike to hit broadway was in 2003 .
the latest dispute was thought to have been especially damaging as some of broadway 's most profitable shows , including hairspray and wicked , were closed over the thanksgiving weekend - one of the most lucrative in the calendar .

both camborne and falmouth fire stations faced an end to full-time cover overnight as part of £ 1m planned budget cuts by cornwall county council .
but after a fire service review , the council 's executive committee is to recommend that the full council agrees to keep full-time cover at camborne .
they will also ask for £ 300,000 to improve the retained fire service .
the proposals will be discussed at a full council meeting in january .
representatives of the fire brigade 's union said they were pleased with the move but still wanted more to be done to safeguard the brigade 's future .
the union has called a meeting of its members in camborne to discuss the announcement .
public concerns firefighters and unions have been campaigning against the plans which the county council said it needed to help address an overall £ 15m budget shortfall .
camborne and falmouth are the only county stations to be manned around the clock .
under the plans emergency cover would be provided by firefighters responding from home , adding time to call outs .
david whalley , leader of the council said : " we have listened to the concerns of the public and firefighters about proposed changes in the fire service , and looked at the research .
" the evidence shows the valuable work of our retained firefighters .
but more money needs to be invested into the retained fire service to ensure we can recruit and retain effectively .
" we will therefore provide over £ 300,000 to improve the retained fire service . "
mr whalley said a detailed risk assessment for the whole of cornwall was due next year .

both camborne and falmouth fire stations faced an end to full-time cover overnight as part of £ 1m planned budget cuts by cornwall county council .
but after a fire service review , the council 's executive committee is to recommend that the full council agrees to keep full-time cover at camborne .
they will also ask for £ 300,000 to improve the retained fire service .
the proposals will be discussed at a full council meeting in january .
representatives of the fire brigade 's union said they were pleased with the move but still wanted more to be done to safeguard the brigade 's future .
the union has called a meeting of its members in camborne to discuss the announcement .
public concerns firefighters and unions have been campaigning against the plans which the county council said it needed to help address an overall £ 15m budget shortfall .
camborne and falmouth are the only county stations to be manned around the clock .
under the plans emergency cover would be provided by firefighters responding from home , adding time to call outs .
david whalley , leader of the council said : " we have listened to the concerns of the public and firefighters about proposed changes in the fire service , and looked at the research .
" the evidence shows the valuable work of our retained firefighters .
but more money needs to be invested into the retained fire service to ensure we can recruit and retain effectively .

david bermingham , 44 , gary mulgrew , 45 , and giles darby , 44 , the so-called natwest three , admitted one wire fraud charge after a plea bargain .
a texas judge must approve the sentence agreed as part of the deal .
the bankers had faced up to 35 years in prison .
they admitted conspiring with ex-enron staff to defraud natwest of $ 19m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- and then split $ 7m between themselves . "
they fully accepted the responsibility for the significant lapse of judgement that led to the filing of these charges " reid figel lawyer bankers offer guilty plea q & a : the natwest three the men they conspired with - andrew fastow and michael kopper - are already in jail .
according to the charges brought by prosecutors , the three men advised their former employer , natwest , to sell part of a firm owned by enron for less than it was worth .
the three men then left the bank and bought a stake in the enron-owned company , before selling it on at a higher price for a profit .
natwest payback mr bermingham of goring , oxfordshire , mr mulgrew , a glaswegian who now lives in brighton , sussex , and mr darby of lower wraxall , wiltshire , will be sentenced on 22 february and hope to serve their jail term in the uk .
they had previously protested their innocence to seven charges .
" by changing their plea , gary , giles and david have fully accepted the responsibility for the significant lapse of judgement that led to the filing of these charges and which has caused them to be separated from their family in the uk for more than 17 months , " lawyer reid figel said .
as part of the plea bargain , they are to pay $ 7.35m to the royal bank of scotland , which now owns natwest .
" under the terms of the agreement ... the three have agreed to immediately pay rbs $ 1.2m , " rbs group said in a statement .
" judgement in favour of rbs is also being entered against them at the high court , london for an additional $ 6m .
this will be in full and final satisfaction of rbs ' claims against them . "
high-profile extradition the trio were arrested in the uk in 2004 and the case hit the headlines last year as the three men fought against their extradition to the us .
they were extradited in july 2006 under a new fast-track system agreed by the uk government .
all three have been on bail since shortly after their extradition but were barred from returning to the uk before their trial .
enron , once the seventh-largest company in the us , collapsed in 2001 with debts of $ 31.8bn -lrb- £ 18.3bn -rrb- after it was revealed that it had fraudulently hidden vast losses from investors .
the guilty pleas showed " the extent of the fraud at enron went well beyond us borders " said kenneth kaiser , assistant director of the fbi 's criminal investigative division said .
wire fraud is a us legal concept that allows for higher penalties against any fraudulent activity , if the activity in question involves electronic communications of any sort .
it is often used as a means for a federal prosecution of what would otherwise have been a matter for a state court .

the classmate pcs run a stripped down version of microsoft windows but are also offered to schools with an open source linux operating system .
pupils are given fans to plug into the pc as a reward for doing well in class - one initiative which has prompted an improvement in grades , according to teachers .
the internet connection is provided by an expensive wimax link , a long-range wireless connection which floods the abuja metropolitan area .
a diesel generator has had to also be installed at the school to allow lessons to continue during the frequent power cuts that blight nigeria .
the commercial scheme has been criticised by some who say it has stifled other not-for-profit projects , such as the $ 100 laptop programme , that have similar aims .

the government-funded school has been given 280 computers designed specifically for children as well laptops for teachers , internet access and a digital curriculum teachers use interactive whiteboards to as well as their own laptops which can connect to the pupil 's classmate pcs to distribute notes and assignments .
the classmate pcs run a stripped down version of microsoft windows but are also offered to schools with an open source linux operating system .
pupils are given fans to plug into the pc as a reward for doing well in class - one initiative which has prompted an improvement in grades , according to teachers .
the internet connection is provided by an expensive wimax link , a long-range wireless connection which floods the abuja metropolitan area .
a diesel generator has had to also be installed at the school to allow lessons to continue during the frequent power cuts that blight nigeria .

three british bankers extradited to the us on charges linked to enron each look set to face a 37-month jail sentence .
david bermingham , 44 , gary mulgrew , 45 , and giles darby , 44 , the so-called natwest three , admitted one wire fraud charge after a plea bargain .
a texas judge must approve the sentence agreed as part of the deal .
the bankers had faced up to 35 years in prison .
they admitted conspiring with ex-enron staff to defraud natwest of $ 19m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- and then split $ 7m between themselves .
they fully accepted the responsibility for the significant lapse of judgement that led to the filing of these charges reid figel lawyer bankers offer guilty plea q & a : the natwest three the men they conspired with - andrew fastow and michael kopper - are already in jail .
according to the charges brought by prosecutors , the three men advised their former employer , natwest , to sell part of a firm owned by enron for less than it was worth .
the three men then left the bank and bought a stake in the enron-owned company , before selling it on at a higher price for a profit .
natwest payback mr bermingham of goring , oxfordshire , mr mulgrew , a glaswegian who now lives in brighton , sussex , and mr darby of lower wraxall , wiltshire , will be sentenced on 22 february and hope to serve their jail term in the uk .
they had previously protested their innocence to seven charges .
" by changing their plea , gary , giles and david have fully accepted the responsibility for the significant lapse of judgement that led to the filing of these charges and which has caused them to be separated from their family in the uk for more than 17 months , " lawyer reid figel said .
as part of the plea bargain , they are to pay $ 7.35m to the royal bank of scotland , which now owns natwest .
" under the terms of the agreement ... the three have agreed to immediately pay rbs $ 1.2m , " rbs group said in a statement .
" judgement in favour of rbs is also being entered against them at the high court , london for an additional $ 6m .
this will be in full and final satisfaction of rbs ' claims against them . "
high-profile extradition the trio were arrested in the uk in 2004 and the case hit the headlines last year as the three men fought against their extradition to the us .
the three are said to have profited from a former enron business they were extradited in july 2006 under a new fast-track system agreed by the uk government .
all three have been on bail since shortly after their extradition but were barred from returning to the uk before their trial .
enron , once the seventh-largest company in the us , collapsed in 2001 with debts of $ 31.8bn -lrb- £ 18.3bn -rrb- after it was revealed that it had fraudulently hidden vast losses from investors .
the guilty pleas showed " the extent of the fraud at enron went well beyond us borders " said kenneth kaiser , assistant director of the fbi 's criminal investigative division said .
wire fraud is a us legal concept that allows for higher penalties against any fraudulent activity , if the activity in question involves electronic communications of any sort .
it is often used as a means for a federal prosecution of what would otherwise have been a matter for a state court .

a texas judge must approve the sentence agreed as part of the deal .
the bankers had faced up to 35 years in prison .
they admitted conspiring with ex-enron staff to defraud natwest of $ 19m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- and then split $ 7m between themselves .
they fully accepted the responsibility for the significant lapse of judgement that led to the filing of these charges reid figel lawyer bankers offer guilty plea q & a : the natwest three the men they conspired with - andrew fastow and michael kopper - are already in jail .
according to the charges brought by prosecutors , the three men advised their former employer , natwest , to sell part of a firm owned by enron for less than it was worth .
the three men then left the bank and bought a stake in the enron-owned company , before selling it on at a higher price for a profit .

he was one of a group of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
city of london police have said all five men have been released on bail until february .
among those arrested were portsmouth 's chief executive peter storrie and the club 's former chairman milan mandaric .
another of those who were held is understood to be charlton player and senegalese international amdy faye , currently on loan to rangers .
the city of london police inquiry is believed to be centred around the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by agent willie mckay .
inquiries help mr redknapp , 60 , said : " we all helped the police with their inquiries , but it does n't directly concern me , it 's other people involved .
" i 've been answering questions to help the police .
i am not directly concerned with their inquiries .
" they have to arrest you to talk to you , for you to be in the police station .
i think that 's the end of it , it did n't directly concern me . "
paul martin , the solicitor representing mr redknapp and mr storrie , said : " the inquiries do not relate to either of those individuals .
they relate to entirely different individuals . "
a spokesman for mr mandaric , 69 , said the leicester city chairman would " continue to offer his full and total support to the police " .
police said the arrested men were aged 69 , 60 , 55 , 48 and 30 and had been questioned over conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the 69-year-old was also held on suspicion of money laundering , a spokesman said .
previous arrests detectives from the economic crime unit of the city of london police are investigating allegations of corruption within football and its impact on owners and shareholders .
in july , officers raided newcastle united , portsmouth and rangers football clubs as part of the inquiry .
a spokesman for portsmouth said on wednesday the club 's chief executive and manager had " been asked to help police with their inquiries concerning a matter dating back to 2003 " prior to the new owner taking control of the club in 2006 .
he added the club was " fully supportive of peter and harry " .
rangers fc have confirmed that a player was arrested in a matter " totally unrelated " to the club .
the latest arrests bring the total number of people detained in connection with the investigation to seven .
in september , a 28-year-old man was arrested in london and in may , a 61-year-old man was arrested in manchester on suspicion of money laundering .
a separate inquiry conducted last year by former metropolitan police commissioner lord stevens highlighted concerns over 17 player transfers and five premier league clubs .

he was one of a group of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
city of london police have said all five men have been released on bail until february .
among those arrested were portsmouth 's chief executive peter storrie and the club 's former chairman milan mandaric .
another of those who were held is understood to be charlton player and senegalese international amdy faye , currently on loan to rangers .
the city of london police inquiry is believed to be centred around the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by agent willie mckay .
inquiries help mr redknapp , 60 , said : " we all helped the police with their inquiries , but it does n't directly concern me , it 's other people involved .
" i 've been answering questions to help the police .
i am not directly concerned with their inquiries .
" they have to arrest you to talk to you , for you to be in the police station .
i think that 's the end of it , it did n't directly concern me . "
paul martin , the solicitor representing mr redknapp and mr storrie , said : " the inquiries do not relate to either of those individuals .
they relate to entirely different individuals . "
a spokesman for mr mandaric , 69 , said the leicester city chairman would " continue to offer his full and total support to the police " .
police said the arrested men were aged 69 , 60 , 55 , 48 and 30 and had been questioned over conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the 69-year-old was also held on suspicion of money laundering , a spokesman said .
previous arrests detectives from the economic crime unit of the city of london police are investigating allegations of corruption within football and its impact on owners and shareholders .
in july , officers raided newcastle united , portsmouth and rangers football clubs as part of the inquiry .
a spokesman for portsmouth said on wednesday the club 's chief executive and manager had " been asked to help police with their inquiries concerning a matter dating back to 2003 " prior to the new owner taking control of the club in 2006 .
he added the club was " fully supportive of peter and harry " .
rangers fc have confirmed that a player was arrested in a matter " totally unrelated " to the club .
the latest arrests bring the total number of people detained in connection with the investigation to seven .
in september , a 28-year-old man was arrested in london and in may , a 61-year-old man was arrested in manchester on suspicion of money laundering .
a separate inquiry conducted last year by former metropolitan police commissioner lord stevens highlighted concerns over 17 player transfers and five premier league clubs .

he was one of a group of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
city of london police have said all five men have been released on bail until february .
among those arrested were portsmouth 's chief executive peter storrie and the club 's former chairman milan mandaric .
another of those who were held is understood to be charlton player and senegalese international amdy faye , currently on loan to rangers .
the city of london police inquiry is believed to be centred around the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by agent willie mckay .
inquiries help mr redknapp , 60 , said : " we all helped the police with their inquiries , but it does n't directly concern me , it 's other people involved .
" i 've been answering questions to help the police .
i am not directly concerned with their inquiries .
" they have to arrest you to talk to you , for you to be in the police station .
i think that 's the end of it , it did n't directly concern me . "
paul martin , the solicitor representing mr redknapp and mr storrie , said : " the inquiries do not relate to either of those individuals .
they relate to entirely different individuals . "
a spokesman for mr mandaric , 69 , said the leicester city chairman would " continue to offer his full and total support to the police " .
police said the arrested men were aged 69 , 60 , 55 , 48 and 30 and had been questioned over conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the 69-year-old was also held on suspicion of money laundering , a spokesman said .
previous arrests detectives from the economic crime unit of the city of london police are investigating allegations of corruption within football and its impact on owners and shareholders .
in july , officers raided newcastle united , portsmouth and rangers football clubs as part of the inquiry .
a spokesman for portsmouth said on wednesday the club 's chief executive and manager had " been asked to help police with their inquiries concerning a matter dating back to 2003 " prior to the new owner taking control of the club in 2006 .
he added the club was " fully supportive of peter and harry " .
rangers fc have confirmed that a player was arrested in a matter " totally unrelated " to the club .
the latest arrests bring the total number of people detained in connection with the investigation to seven .
in september , a 28-year-old man was arrested in london and in may , a 61-year-old man was arrested in manchester on suspicion of money laundering .
a separate inquiry conducted last year by former metropolitan police commissioner lord stevens highlighted concerns over 17 player transfers and five premier league clubs .

they each look set to face a 37-month jail sentence - the latest development in a five-year trans-atlantic fraud case .
what is happening in the us ?
david bermingham , 44 , gary mulgrew , 45 , and giles darby , 44 , have admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain .
the three men were originally scheduled to go on trial in january , but entered their pleas at a hearing before us district judge ewing werlein .
sentencing is set to take place on 22 february and if the judge approves the deal , the natwest three are set to face a 37-month jail sentence .
the three had previously said they were innocent of all seven charges that they faced .
if found guilty of the seven charges , they would have faced up to 35 years in jail .
what have they admitted ?
the trio have pleaded guilty to conspiring with former enron staff to defraud natwest of $ 19m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- and then splitting $ 7m between them .
the men they conspired with - andrew fastow and michael kopper - are already in jail .
is jail their only punishment ?
and where will they serve their sentence ?
as part of the plea bargain , they are to pay $ 7.35m to the royal bank of scotland , which now owns natwest .
the men hope that they will be able to serve what ever period in detention they must serve in the uk .
while they are theoretically facing a 37 month jail term , observers say it is unlikely that they will actually be in custody for that period of time .
it is possible that the time they have been on bail - unable to leave the us - will be deducted from their sentence .
what is the background to the case ?
the men used to work for a subsidiary of natwest bank .
in 2002 , us prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the three men , accusing them of conspiring to defraud their employers and investors in collapsed us energy giant enron .
us prosecutors alleged that the three bankers were involved in a fraud in which their employer , greenwich natwest , was advised to sell off its stake in an enron unit at well below its market value .
they then left the bank and purchased a $ 250,000 stake in the unit - which they sold on at a much higher price , making a profit of $ 7.3m.
initially the three denied any wrongdoing .
but the us alleged that they conspired with enron ex-chief financial officer andrew fastow - now serving a 10-year sentence - and ex-global finance boss michael kopper in the sale .
the three exhausted almost every legal avenue during their two-year battle against extradition .
why did the extradition process provoke such controversy ?
the three men were at the centre of a fierce political row over uk-us extradition laws .
they were extradited to the us and put on a flight to houston despite widespread claims that the process used to do so is unfair and they should be tried in the uk .
the three faced extradition under the terms of a treaty drawn up by the two countries in 2003 .
although the treaty has not yet been formally ratified , its main elements were enshrined into british law through the extradition act , made law in late 2003 .
natwest three timeline 2002 : us prosecutors issue arrest warrants for the three men , in connection with suspected fraud october 2004 : a judge rules that the three can be extradited to the us to face charges may 2005 : after a judicial review , charles clarke says the extradition should go ahead february 2006 : the high court upholds the extradition decision on appeal july 2006 : the attorney general rejects calls for the case to be tried in the uk november 2007 : three plead guilty to one count of wire fraud this legislation was designed to modernise and speed up the uk 's extradition system , making it easier to deal with those suspected of cross-border offences such as terrorism and organised crime .
critics - including business leaders and civil liberties groups - claim the law as it stands is unbalanced and gives british nationals far less legal protection than people in other countries .
how does the us system differ from the uk 's ?
under the terms of the 2003 act , the us authorities need to outline the alleged offence , and provide " evidence or information that would justify the issue of a warrant for arrest in the uk " .
for its part , britain must provide the us with evidence of " probable cause " if it wishes to extradite someone from america .
probable cause , which is a phrase used in the us constitution 's fourth amendment concerning search and seizure , has been defined as " information sufficient to warrant a prudent person 's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime . "
it includes such element as identification and a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed .
it is a stronger standard than " reasonable suspicion " .
the uk government argues that the burden of evidence required in both systems is comparable : that the police must reasonably believe that a crime has been committed and an individual is suspected of that crime .
but opposition politicians say the laws are not reciprocal and want them to be changed .
is the current extradition law final ?
the law was agreed by parliament but even this is a subject of dispute .
critics claim that a decision to designate the us as one of more than 20 non-eu countries where prima facie evidence was not required was not voted on - but the government said the issue was fully debated .
there is also concern that the extradition treaty has yet to be ratified by the us congress , more than two years after it was agreed .
two thirds of senators need to support the treaty for it to be passed .

they each look set to face a 37-month jail sentence - the latest development in a five-year trans-atlantic fraud case .
what is happening in the us ?
david bermingham , 44 , gary mulgrew , 45 , and giles darby , 44 , have admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain .
the three men were originally scheduled to go on trial in january , but entered their pleas at a hearing before us district judge ewing werlein .
sentencing is set to take place on 22 february and if the judge approves the deal , the natwest three are set to face a 37-month jail sentence .
the three had previously said they were innocent of all seven charges that they faced .
if found guilty of the seven charges , they would have faced up to 35 years in jail .
what have they admitted ?
the trio have pleaded guilty to conspiring with former enron staff to defraud natwest of $ 19m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- and then splitting $ 7m between them .
the men they conspired with - andrew fastow and michael kopper - are already in jail .
is jail their only punishment ?
and where will they serve their sentence ?
as part of the plea bargain , they are to pay $ 7.35m to the royal bank of scotland , which now owns natwest .
the men hope that they will be able to serve what ever period in detention they must serve in the uk .
while they are theoretically facing a 37 month jail term , observers say it is unlikely that they will actually be in custody for that period of time .
it is possible that the time they have been on bail - unable to leave the us - will be deducted from their sentence .
what is the background to the case ?
the men used to work for a subsidiary of natwest bank .
in 2002 , us prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the three men , accusing them of conspiring to defraud their employers and investors in collapsed us energy giant enron .
us prosecutors alleged that the three bankers were involved in a fraud in which their employer , greenwich natwest , was advised to sell off its stake in an enron unit at well below its market value .
they then left the bank and purchased a $ 250,000 stake in the unit - which they sold on at a much higher price , making a profit of $ 7.3m.
initially the three denied any wrongdoing .
but the us alleged that they conspired with enron ex-chief financial officer andrew fastow - now serving a 10-year sentence - and ex-global finance boss michael kopper in the sale .
the three exhausted almost every legal avenue during their two-year battle against extradition .
why did the extradition process provoke such controversy ?
the three men were at the centre of a fierce political row over uk-us extradition laws .
they were extradited to the us and put on a flight to houston despite widespread claims that the process used to do so is unfair and they should be tried in the uk .
the three faced extradition under the terms of a treaty drawn up by the two countries in 2003 .
although the treaty has not yet been formally ratified , its main elements were enshrined into british law through the extradition act , made law in late 2003 .
natwest three timeline 2002 : us prosecutors issue arrest warrants for the three men , in connection with suspected fraud october 2004 : a judge rules that the three can be extradited to the us to face charges may 2005 : after a judicial review , charles clarke says the extradition should go ahead february 2006 : the high court upholds the extradition decision on appeal july 2006 : the attorney general rejects calls for the case to be tried in the uk november 2007 : three plead guilty to one count of wire fraud this legislation was designed to modernise and speed up the uk 's extradition system , making it easier to deal with those suspected of cross-border offences such as terrorism and organised crime .
critics - including business leaders and civil liberties groups - claim the law as it stands is unbalanced and gives british nationals far less legal protection than people in other countries .
how does the us system differ from the uk 's ?
under the terms of the 2003 act , the us authorities need to outline the alleged offence , and provide " evidence or information that would justify the issue of a warrant for arrest in the uk " .
for its part , britain must provide the us with evidence of " probable cause " if it wishes to extradite someone from america .
probable cause , which is a phrase used in the us constitution 's fourth amendment concerning search and seizure , has been defined as " information sufficient to warrant a prudent person 's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime . "
it includes such element as identification and a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed .
it is a stronger standard than " reasonable suspicion " .
the uk government argues that the burden of evidence required in both systems is comparable : that the police must reasonably believe that a crime has been committed and an individual is suspected of that crime .
but opposition politicians say the laws are not reciprocal and want them to be changed .
is the current extradition law final ?
the law was agreed by parliament but even this is a subject of dispute .
critics claim that a decision to designate the us as one of more than 20 non-eu countries where prima facie evidence was not required was not voted on - but the government said the issue was fully debated .
there is also concern that the extradition treaty has yet to be ratified by the us congress , more than two years after it was agreed .
two thirds of senators need to support the treaty for it to be passed .

he forecast that after the period of uncertainty , growth would return to its long-run average and inflation to its target of 2 % , king said .
a fire alarm at the house of commons temporarily interrupted the hearing .
bbc business editor robert peston said that evidence heard from the governor before the interruption was " enough to make grown men weep " .
housing hit ?
turmoil in international financial markets has led to a tightening of credit conditions , particularly for the riskiest borrowers , king said .
this will have a knock-on effect on consumer spending , and in turn , the economy , he said .
" with borrowing more expensive and less easily available , the personal savings rate is likely to rise , leading to slower growth of consumer spending , " he said .
mr king was sceptical about whether sub-prime losses in the us could , on their own , lead to a major market slowdown .
the estimated $ 200bn hit taken by firms was the equivalent to a 1.5 % fall in the us stock market , he added .
