he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .

the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .

he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .

the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .

schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .

the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .

while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .
the parliament will also discuss whether to keep its six tornado warplanes , which are flying reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , stationed in the afghanistan .
both the jets and bundeswehr troops on the ground are prohibited from participating in combat missions .

while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .
a social democrat , steinmeier will likely get support from his coalition partners in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
chancellor and cdu party head angela merkel has said she does n't want to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan , and some cdu lawmakers have called for increasing the number of bundeswehr soldiers stationed there .
disagreement over mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldier patrol near kabul but members of steinmeier 's party have been more skeptical about the call for more troops .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .

this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .
the parliament will also discuss whether to keep its six tornado warplanes , which are flying reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , stationed in the afghanistan .
both the jets and bundeswehr troops on the ground are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
training crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants more training for the afghan army numerous german politicians have called for pulling back on support for the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- in afghanistan , which has been criticized for causing a high number of civilian casualties .
while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .
a social democrat , steinmeier will likely get support from his coalition partners in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
chancellor and cdu party head angela merkel has said she does n't want to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan , and some cdu lawmakers have called for increasing the number of bundeswehr soldiers stationed there .
disagreement over mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldier patrol near kabul but members of steinmeier 's party have been more skeptical about the call for more troops .
some want the number of forces reduced while others have called for a complete withdrawal from afghanistan .
the german presence in afghanistan is seen as making the country more of a terrorist target .
recent polls show nearly two-thirds of germans want troops pulled out of the country .
more than 20 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since 2001 .
hajo funke , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , said germans feel the situation in afghanistan is getting worse .
there 's also the feeling that the united states and nato do n't have a clear strategy .
nato has approximately 40,000 isaf troops in the country .
" the military strategy seems to be doing no good , " funke told reuters news agency .
" the whole strategy appears trapped .

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .

while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .

the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .

he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .
the parliament will also discuss whether to keep its six tornado warplanes , which are flying reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , stationed in the afghanistan .
both the jets and bundeswehr troops on the ground are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
training crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants more training for the afghan army numerous german politicians have called for pulling back on support for the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- in afghanistan , which has been criticized for causing a high number of civilian casualties .
while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .
a social democrat , steinmeier will likely get support from his coalition partners in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
chancellor and cdu party head angela merkel has said she does n't want to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan , and some cdu lawmakers have called for increasing the number of bundeswehr soldiers stationed there .
disagreement over mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldier patrol near kabul but members of steinmeier 's party have been more skeptical about the call for more troops .
some want the number of forces reduced while others have called for a complete withdrawal from afghanistan .
the german presence in afghanistan is seen as making the country more of a terrorist target .
recent polls show nearly two-thirds of germans want troops pulled out of the country .
more than 20 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since 2001 .
hajo funke , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , said germans feel the situation in afghanistan is getting worse .
there 's also the feeling that the united states and nato do n't have a clear strategy .
nato has approximately 40,000 isaf troops in the country .
" the military strategy seems to be doing no good , " funke told reuters news agency .
" the whole strategy appears trapped .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the offer was more than double the 2 percent europe 's largest rail network offered the unions before they staged industrial action that brought many services to a standstill for three days last week .
transnet and gdba had been seeking a 7percent pay increase .
but travelers faced further delays on tuesday when the gdl drivers ' union called a three-hour stoppage to press demands for a separate contract and a 31 percent pay hike for deutsche bahn 's 20,000 train drivers .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .
" the transition will take a lot of time and above all , lots of work and money , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .
" the transition will take a lot of time and above all , lots of work and money , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .

he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.07.2007 sarkozy on collision course with eu financial powers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy faces opposition , specifically from germany , over his economic governance plan despite a promise to step up france 's role in the european union , french president nicolas sarkozy risks riling paris ' partners in the euro zone on monday over his economic policies . true to his image as a whirlwind of activity , the new french leader has invited himself to a regular dinner meeting on monday of finance ministers from the 13 countries sharing the euro .
" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .

a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .

according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .

police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .
" we would like the european countries to agree on a european candidate , " she said . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .

the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .

while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.07.2007 air berlin orders 25 boeing 787 dreamliners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 787 dreamliner is already filling up boeing 's order books germany 's second largest airline , low-cost carrier air berlin , has ordered 25 of boeing 's new 787 dreamliner planes making it the single largest order placed by any european carrier . air berlin said on sunday that company ceo joachim hunold had inked the deal worth $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.935 billion euros -rrb- at boeing headquarters in seattle in the us .
on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .

but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .

sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .

rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .
" we would like the european countries to agree on a european candidate , " she said . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .

maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 09.07.2007 german interior minister calls for stronger anti-terrorism laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants tougher laws to fight terrorists germany 's interior minister wants the right to detain terrorists before they launch an attack and has suggested there may be cases in which terrorists should be killed .
the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .

the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .

he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .

a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .
on monday , vattenfall executives are to meet with representatives of germany 's federal environment ministry and with state authorities from schleswig-holstein to discuss the company 's handling of the incidents and its information policies . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.07.2007 politician says future immigrants must speak basic german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped more immigrants will speak basic german before they come to the country in an interview with deutsche welle , maria böhmer , germany 's integration commissioner , talked about the issues that have spurred turkish groups to boycott a key upcoming integration summit . days before an integration summit called by german chancellor angela merkel and meant to explore ways to ease the assimilation of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants , two turkish groups have threatened to boycott talks .
they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .
dreamliner boasts " green " credentials air berlin said its order for 25 dreamliners was aimed at swapping out its entire fleet in the future .
air berlin planned to secure its long-haul capacity in the long term , ceo hunold said in a press statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .
boeing flying ahead of airbus with dreamliner the 787 , which has a seating capacity of between 210 and 300 seats , will go into service after european arch rival airbus ' mammoth a380 takes to the skies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus jumbo a380 some analysts say that boeing has raced ahead of airbus in the long-standing tussle between the two rivals with its ecologically-friendly 787 model .
in response to boeing 's dreamliner , airbus has announced plans for a further new model , the a350 .
but the new plane is not expected to be ready for commercial use until 2013 .
richard aboulafia from the aviation consultancy , teal group , told deutsche welle that airbus ' a350 is a promising model but the european airplane-maker had already spent too many funds on the a380 .

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin ceo joachim hunold he added that air berlin had secured a significant price reduction for the planes without giving further details .
the airliner , which says it is looking into several financing options , said payment for the jets must be ready by 2011 .
air berlin has underscored the dreamliner 's " green " credentials in justifying its order .
the aircraft boasts a series of fuel-efficient design features largely credited with filling boeing 's order books .
air berlin 's hunold emphasized that with the purchase of the 787 dreamliners , his company " would make a significant contribution to protecting the environment beyond all theoretical discussions and legal impositions . "
with the 787 , the aviation industry proved that economically sound decisions could also be ecologically good , hunold added .
the 787 will be the world 's first commercial jetliner which does away with aluminum and makes use of carbon-fiber composites which are lighter and sturdier .
up to 50 percent of the plane - including the fuselage and wing - are made of carbon-fiber .
boeing has also said that new technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain - an alluring idea at a time of rising oil prices in the aviation sector .
" the airplane will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions than today 's similarly sized airplane , " boeing said in a statement .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire-fighters at the krümmel nuclear plant after a blaze broke out in the first such report from the brunsbüttel power station near station , the company said staff at the reactor were surprised by a surge of hot water and then forgot to hold down a control button .
this caused an automatic cut-off of the reactor 's water filtration system for eight minutes .
there was no release of radioactivity .
at the time the plant was powering up after a short circuit had closed it for three days .
the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .
energy firm 's information policy under scrutiny energy regulators of schleswig-holstein state said sunday vattenfall had only reported the error at the last moment .
hours later , vattenfall europe said it had decided to inform the public better about nuclear incidents and published on its web site detailed technical correspondence about the accidents at its brunsbüttel and krümmel reactors .
ivo banek , a spokesman for vattenfall , said the brunsbüttel blunders had posed no safety risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents demonstrating in germany in2003 however , the latest disclosures have prompted a fresh demand by germany 's opposition greens party for swedish-owned vattenfall 's nuclear licence to be revoked on grounds of unreliability .
" vattenfall 's scandalous approach to the legally-binding right to information shows that that this company does n't possess the reliability that the nuclear energy law demands from operators of nuclear plants , " said reinhard bütikofer , head of the green party .

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .
the parliament will also discuss whether to keep its six tornado warplanes , which are flying reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , stationed in the afghanistan .
both the jets and bundeswehr troops on the ground are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
training crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants more training for the afghan army numerous german politicians have called for pulling back on support for the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- in afghanistan , which has been criticized for causing a high number of civilian casualties .
while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .
a social democrat , steinmeier will likely get support from his coalition partners in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
chancellor and cdu party head angela merkel has said she does n't want to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan , and some cdu lawmakers have called for increasing the number of bundeswehr soldiers stationed there .
disagreement over mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldier patrol near kabul but members of steinmeier 's party have been more skeptical about the call for more troops .
some want the number of forces reduced while others have called for a complete withdrawal from afghanistan .
the german presence in afghanistan is seen as making the country more of a terrorist target .
recent polls show nearly two-thirds of germans want troops pulled out of the country .
more than 20 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since 2001 .
hajo funke , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , said germans feel the situation in afghanistan is getting worse .
there 's also the feeling that the united states and nato do n't have a clear strategy .
nato has approximately 40,000 isaf troops in the country .
" the military strategy seems to be doing no good , " funke told reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2007 schuster the next coach through real madrid 's revolving doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returns to real madrid as coach after a successful spell as a palyer in the 80s former fc köln and germany star bernd schuster has been officially revealed as the new coach of spanish champs real madrid , the club said monday .
he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "

france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .

french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .

" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .
although sarkozy managed to ease the free-marketeers ' concerns that the move would not weaken the legal basis for eu competition policy , some antitrust lawyers and professors still have doubts . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this unusual move should be seen as an attempt to add political weight to help smooth the discussion of his plan to delay by two years the elimination of the public deficit in france , " said bank of america economist gilles moec .
in addition to making his case for pushing back the previous government 's commitment to balance the state accounts by 2010 , sarkozy is also due to flesh out his plans for giving a higher political profile to the euro zone .
however , both initiatives could prove to be contentious , especially with germany , which is making big efforts to balance its books and is suspicious of sarkozy 's push for more " economic governance " for the euro zone .
more time sarkozy wants more time to rein in the french deficit in order to launch a series of tax cuts aimed at jolting the french economy with a growth " shock " , but the move risks reversing the deficit 's current downward trend .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break an eu rule requiring fiscal shortfalls to be kept to less than three percent of output , which could get paris in trouble with its european partners .
a deterioration in the french accounts would be all the more galling for germany because berlin is working hard to stamp out its deficit even before the 2010 deadline that all euro zone countries agreed to target in april .
firing a shot over sarkozy 's bow , german finance minister peer steinbrück warned on wednesday : " if france were to drop the medium-term objectives that we all developed together , including france , then we 'd have a problem . "
the european union 's portuguese presidency and european central bank have also warned against breaking commitments on reining in public finances .
interventionist ?
while sarkozy faces a rough ride over his fiscal plans , his push for more " economic governance " in the euro zone is only slightly less controversial given his past attacks on the ecb 's monetary policy and calls to devalue the euro .
sarkozy has frequently criticized the central bank 's focus on inflation and wants a higher profile for the eurogroup of finance ministers to act as a counterweight , much to the concern of germany , which is deeply attached to the ecb 's independence from politics .
he has also called for a review of the euro zone ’ s currently lax and relaxed approach to the euro 's strength , which he says is undermining the competitiveness of france 's exports .
" while it is clear that the french external sector has performed poorly , these problems have been fairly specific to france , reflecting an underlying lack of competitiveness , rather than an over-valued currency , " said capital economics analyst jennifer mckeown .
mr. eu ? the looming clashes over economic policy come as sarkozy tries to carve out a new leading role for himself and france on the eu stage after french voters plunged the bloc into political uncertainty two years ago by rejecting the eu 's draft constitution .
at his debut eu summit last month in brussels , he went out of his way to be instrumental in brokering a deal for a new treaty reforming the union 's underlying rules .
however , he also courted controversy by getting the importance of " free and undistorted competition " in the new treaty downgraded to the alarm of free-market friendly countries like britain .

this year , germans are rediscovering great travel destinations in their own country . holidays on home soil are becoming increasingly popular among germans , according to adac , germany 's version of aaa .
of those surveyed , 41.1 percent chose germany as their destination of choice this year , up 1.3 points from the previous year .
italy came in second place -lrb- 16 percent -rrb- , followed by france , austria , croatia and switzerland . specifically , the baltic sea coast and mecklenburg lake district were voted the most popular holiday regions .
after years of crowding the beaches of the mediterranean sea , the hot summers in recent years have apparently reminded germans that they have their own seaside , too . booked out beach chairs several weeks before the summer holidays officially began , many spots along the baltic and north sea coasts were already fully booked , according to a dpa news service report .
hotel occupancy is also higher than in the previous year . those who have n't planned ahead may be out of luck .
on wangerooge island , many of the 1,300 beach chairs that adorn the main beach were reserved long ago , and on the island of borkum there are only single rooms left in hotels and guesthouses .
the same is true of the baltic sea islands as well . however , judging by the current " summer weather " conditions - a capricious mixture of clouds and rain - it remains to be seen how many germans actually make the trip to the coast .
maybe next year will see a reverse trend of vacationers sitting in their beach chairs with warm socks on , ruefully thinking of their last summer holiday in sunny spain or italy . dw staff -lrb- cjt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's unclear whether germany will continue to support the us-led operation enduring freedom . frank-walter steinmeier has entered the debate over the future of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan .
the foreign minister said he wants to see the number of troops increased , a view which differs from many others in his social democratic party . this fall , the german government will decide whether to extend the mandates for some 3,500 german peacekeeping troops taking part in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and with the us-led operation enduring freedom .
most german troops have been stationed in the relatively stable northern part of the country .
the parliament will also discuss whether to keep its six tornado warplanes , which are flying reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , stationed in the afghanistan .
both the jets and bundeswehr troops on the ground are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
training crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants more training for the afghan army numerous german politicians have called for pulling back on support for the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- in afghanistan , which has been criticized for causing a high number of civilian casualties .
while steinmeier said he did n't oppose rethinking germany 's oef involvement , he added that even if germany pulls back from that mission , there needs to be more training of the afghan army and more help with civilian reconstruction .
" during the course of the summer , we 're going to have to discuss strengthening germany 's engagement with the training of the afghan army , " steinmeier said in an interview published in der spiegel magazine .
" any reduction in our engagement would be in principle very difficult to explain , no matter what individual aspect would be affected . "
steinmeier also said he 'd discuss the issue with defense minister franz josef jung .
a social democrat , steinmeier will likely get support from his coalition partners in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
chancellor and cdu party head angela merkel has said she does n't want to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan , and some cdu lawmakers have called for increasing the number of bundeswehr soldiers stationed there .
disagreement over mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldier patrol near kabul but members of steinmeier 's party have been more skeptical about the call for more troops .
some want the number of forces reduced while others have called for a complete withdrawal from afghanistan .
the german presence in afghanistan is seen as making the country more of a terrorist target .
recent polls show nearly two-thirds of germans want troops pulled out of the country .
more than 20 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since 2001 .
hajo funke , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , said germans feel the situation in afghanistan is getting worse .
there 's also the feeling that the united states and nato do n't have a clear strategy .
nato has approximately 40,000 isaf troops in the country .
" the military strategy seems to be doing no good , " funke told reuters news agency .
" the whole strategy appears trapped .

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .

last month , a blaze broke out at the krümmel power plant in geesthacht , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- southeast of northern city of hamburg .
separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded .
the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming .
human error to blame ?
on sunday , vattenfall said that human error at the plant was to blame for a further irregularity .

the revelations that staff were unsure what to do have put the nuclear industry in germany on the defensive .
germany 's 17 reactors are to be phased out by 2021 , but the industry has advocated a revival of nuclear power to reduce german carbon-dioxide emissions .
the european union has set a goal of a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .
" we would like the european countries to agree on a european candidate , " she said . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .
" we would like the european countries to agree on a european candidate , " she said . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .
preventative measures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .
" we must n't kill liberty in an effort to defend it , " said social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck .
" one can not defend the rule of law from terrorism by weakening the principles of the rule of law , " said sebastian edathy , a senior spd member .
police call suggestion a " diversion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say the 're understaffed in terrorism fight the german police union also offered a sharp critique of the suggestion , calling it " a political diversion strategy . "
schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .
" i do n't know why he instigated this discussion , " stadler said .
" there is a prohibition against killing in germany . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .

he replaces fabio capello , who only weeks ago led the team to the title . the coaching roundabout at the santiago bernabau stadium in madrid has officially stopped to let new manager bernd schuster on after months of speculation .
the former real madrid player takes over the recently-crowned spanish champions after predecessor fabio capello was thrown clear of the famously rotation-happy club .
schuster takes the reins knowing that even if he brings continued success to real , his position will be just as precarious as if he had gone a whole season without a victory .
capello , who left juventus at the beginning of last season to coach los blancos , managed to eventually mould a disparate team of fading stars , huge egos and youthful prodigies into a championship-winning outfit .
however , delivering real 's 30th la liga title was not enough for ramón calderón , a club president who goes through coaches like henry viii went through wives .
capello was sent packing while the celebratory champagne was still cold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello only five men have managed to serve for one hundred league matches on the touchline with real .
the last was vicente del bosque , who won two league titles and two champions leagues but still got the boot in 2003 .
schuster will be hoping that his status as a madrid hero will at least save his neck from the chopping block for a little longer than his predecessor . former barca star who was crowned a madrileño after his move from bundesliga club fc köln in 1980 , schuster spent eight years playing with barcelona , real 's greatest rivals , winning the primera liga in 1985 and the european cup winners cup the following year . his move to madrid , which usually sees effigies of the traitorous barca star burnt outside camp nou for years to come , was even equally successful with two league titles in 1989 and 1990 .
the former germany international , a european championship winner in 1980 , returned to his homeland in 1993 after three years with madrid 's city rivals atletico .
in his first season back in the bundesliga with bayer leverkusen , schuster helped the club to a third place finish in 1994 .
he hung up his boots in 1996 .
stock rises with rebuilding of getafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuster returned to spain to refine his coaching career after a number of lower league coaching assignments and jobs which took him to ukraine and then back to spain , schuster eventually settled down with getafe where he was coach from 2005 until the end of last season .
he certainly made an impression , gradually taking the small club from perennial relegation candidates to mid-table stalwarts . by the time madrid came calling , schuster had secured a ninth place in spain 's top division for the second year running .
he also took them to last season 's spanish cup final but suffered defeat to sevilla .
schuster takes on a team shorn of some of its most iconic stars .
david beckham and roberto carlos have both left , bringing to a close the galactico era which promised so much and delivered very little .
ronaldo , another galactico , bailed out mid-season for a new life in milan .
those who remain have a reputation for being a surly bunch of players , who bicker with each other or complain about the club 's hierarchy much of the time .
volatile players to meet their match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham left real on a high before heading for the us but schuster 's record as a player and the well-publicized but unconfirmed report that he agreed to pay up 480,000 euros -lrb- $ 652,800 -rrb- to get out of his contract at getafe to join real will no doubt afford him a high level of respect with the team and fans alike .
a man known for his own fits of pique , schuster is unlikely to take any funny business from madrid 's pampered international stars .
the new coach , however , will have a compatriot under his charge this season after christoph metzelder completed his move from borussia dortmund to the bernabau just days before schuster 's appointment was confirmed . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comments have been criticized as undemocratic . wolfgang schäuble of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the government 's most vocal advocate of taking strong measures to prevent and punish terrorism .
over the weekend , he called on developing new laws to fight terrorism , such as allowing preemptive detention .
germany could benefit from a law that jails suspected terrorists before they launch an attack , schäuble said .
the united states already has similar laws which allow a suspect to be arrested for conspiring to commit a crime .
" another question is whether one can treat such dangerous people as combatants and intern them , " schäuble said in an interview published monday in the german magazine der spiegel .
silke stokar , a spokeswoman for the green party , said stäuble was trying to lay the legal groundwork for starting a guantanamo-style prison in germany .
after the attempted terrorist attacks in great britain , schäuble renewed calls for legislation which would allow computers of suspects to be monitored without their knowledge .
he also called for increased video surveillance in public places and for suspects to be prohibited from using mobile phones .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's terror attacks have raised concerns in germany schäuble defended his controversial proposals by saying he is trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
" you must take risks to defend liberty , but you ca n't just sit back and do nothing , either , " schäuble said on a german television program sunday .
social democrats , who are part of the ruling " grand coalition " along with schäuble 's cdu , rejected the suggestion .

schäuble is engaging in " pure party politics " instead of offering solutions to fight terrorism , police union head konrad freiberg said monday .
germany 's current laws are strict enough , the problem is a lack of manpower and financial resources to implement them , freiberg said .
there are n't enough police , for example , to watch suspected terrorists around the clock .
" it 's scandalous and irresponsible , " freiberg said .
killing terrorists schäuble also angered other politicians by suggesting there were scenarios in which it was appropriate for terrorist suspects to be killed .
schäuble called for a clarification of laws over when this was appropriate .
he used osama bin laden as an example .
in the united states , if the terrorist 's hiding place was discovered , it would be appropriate to bomb it and kill him , schäuble said .
but in germany , the legality would be unclear .
" the americans would execute him and most of the people would say , ' thank god , " ' schäuble said .
max stadler , an interior affairs expert for the opposition fdp party , said he was irritated that schäuble had launched a debate about the killing of suspected terrorists .

" we now have a deal that will ensure peace for the next two years , " deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn told a press conference .
the offer was more than double the 2 percent europe 's largest rail network offered the unions before they staged industrial action that brought many services to a standstill for three days last week .
transnet and gdba had been seeking a 7percent pay increase .
but travelers faced further delays on tuesday when the gdl drivers ' union called a three-hour stoppage to press demands for a separate contract and a 31 percent pay hike for deutsche bahn 's 20,000 train drivers .
gdl chairman manfred schell , who met thursday with mehdorn , said his union would not sign a pay deal agreed between deutsche bahn and the other two unions . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on top of the 25 orders , air berlin is securing 10 options and 15 purchasing rights for additional 787s , the company said .
the first 25 planes will be delivered between 2013 and 2017 , the company added .
air berlin 's mega order , the single largest by any european carrier so far , came as boeing unveiled its much-hyped 787 dreamliner to 15,000 boeing employees , suppliers and customers at its giant assembly plant in everett in washington on sunday .
the dreamliner , the first new boeing airplane in more than a decade , costs between $ 146 million and $ 200 million and has bagged 677 orders worldwide .

by tradition europe chooses the head of the imf and the united states picks the president of the world bank , the imf 's sister institution .
" i do expect a broad exchange of views among ministers concerning the name of the man to be at the helm of the imf , " one diplomat said .
although there had already been " quite a few informal contacts and these contacts will continue , " the diplomat added that " i do not expect to have a name coming out of the meeting . "
in the run-up to the regular meeting of eu finance ministers on tuesday in brussels , several french , italian and polish names had been circulating as possible successors to rato .
sarkozy has proposed senior socialist and former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn , but the plan is likely to generate more heated debate between the france 's european partners .
in an interview published on sunday , sarkozy announced that he had already recommended the respected multilingual diplomat to us president george w. bush and the leaders of spain , italy and britain .
by doing so , some diplomats say , the french president had seized the initiative and got his man 's name on the card before other rival european contenders emerged .
multilingual socialist is sarko 's main man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn is sarkozy 's man for the job strauss-kahn is a strong advocate of the concept of a mixed economy , coupling free-market reform with the defense of a state role in industry , ideas close to those of the president himself .
critics suggest that while strauss-kahn holds some similar economic principles as sarkozy , the president ’ s plan has more to do with depriving the opposition french socialists of one of their most popular and effective figures .
while holding off on endorsing the french candidate , german finance ministry spokesperson torsten albig said at the weekend that the germans held strauss-kahn in high regard as a " good european candidate " but added the german cabinet would discuss the proposal before berlin gave its formal support .
finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .

finance minister peer steinbrück 's deputy thomas mirow , added in a separate statement at an insurance industry seminar in berlin , that strauss-kahn 's competence was not in doubt , but there were other candidates .
" the credentials of strauss-kahn can not be disputed , " mirow 's statement said .
" as regards the political process , we have just started . "
french in strong institutional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy president sarkozy was to attend a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in brussels on monday evening to defend his plans to introduce tax cuts , which will weigh on the french deficit , and was expected to use his presence to promote strauss-kahn 's candidacy .
france has had its fair share of imf heads as frenchmen have led the institution for more than 30 of its 61 years of existence , and also have jean-claude trichet in charge of the european central bank , pascal lamy at the world trade organization and jean lemierre at the european bank for reconstruction and development .
meanwhile speculation continues as to who the other viable candidates would be for the imf position .
other candidates mentioned in passing the wall street journal newspaper last thursday named italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa and the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , as possible candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing imf managing director rato however , draghi said monday that he is not interested in succeeding rodrigo rato as the head of the international monetary fund .
" i am not interested in the imf , " he said on the sidelines of the release of a report by the italian stock exchange authority consob .
" i said so right away -lrb- after rato announced his plan to leave -rrb- , and i say it again , " draghi added .
the financial times newspaper in britain cited two poles , former central bank president leszek balcerowicz and former prime minister marek belka , as potential contenders .
developing countries for years have protested in vain against the tradition of europeans running the imf and americans leading the world bank and have called for an open competition for both posts .
rato 's surprise exit from the imf comes at a sensitive moment as the institution struggles to find its bearings amid an internal reform launched by rato himself and as more and more countries opt not to borrow from it .
" i do n't think europe can simply say ' that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else ' , " british finance minister alistair darling said in remarks released by his office on monday . " there is a view that it is our -lrb- europe 's -rrb- turn .
just because it has always been so in the past does not mean it will always be so in the future , " darling told the guardian newspaper .
" all these processes need to be opened up . " the european commission , on the other hand , would prefer to see the post go to a eu national .
" we hope that european union countries will find a suitable candidate very soon to continue the very important reform process underway , " european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said .
however , she ruled out a non-european to head the imf .
" we would like the european countries to agree on a european candidate , " she said . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they argue that the recent tightening of germany 's immigration law - in particular a clause that states foreigners who wants to bring their spouse to germany must be able to prove that the spouse is can speak basic german and is financially independent - is discriminatory because the rules do not apply to germans wishing to bring a foreign spouse into the country .
the german government has said the restrictions are aimed at preventing forced marriages in its turkish community and countering the development of parallel societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer is responsible for immigration and integration issues dw-radio spoke with maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- about the sticking points .
dw-radio : the changes to the immigration law have been strongly criticized by some turkish groups .
faruk sen , head of the center for turkish studies in essen says these changes could trigger racism .
do you share his opinion ?
maria böhmer : i do n't accept that criticism .
this new law includes many elements that help integration .
for instance , when it comes to learning the german language ´ - the integration courses in germany as well as learning german in immigrants ' own countries before coming to germany .
i think that some turkish groups are creating fears by giving the impression that you have to be able to speak perfect german if you want to come to germany .
but it 's only about being able to speak simple sentences in german .
all that 's needed is a vocabulary of some 200 to 300 words .
that in particular helps women who come to germany to be able to go shopping , go to the doctor or exchange a few words with a neighbor .
naturally , we hope that they will expand their knowledge of german once they are here .
according to the immigration law , immigrants who have a temporary residence permit are now given two years to find work and to fund themselves .
there are estimated to be around 180,000 immigrants who fall in that category in germany .
what will happen to these people if they fail to find work ?
will they be sent back to turkey or wherever they are from ?
no , what 's important that we have taken a significant step forward with the first regulation of its kind across germany that allows these people to work in the county .
that did n't exist earlier .
and that 's why it 's an important step towards integrating all people who have lived for years in germany with a temporary residence permit but whose children have gone to school here and have finished with good grades .
we want to acknowledge that .
the labor market in germany is developing positively and that 's raised the chances of finding work here .
i want to encourage these immigrants to go down this path and actively seek work .
you said it 's good for turkish women to speak a bit of german before they come to germany .
but who decides what " a bit of german " is ?
do these hopeful immigrants have to pass a language test before they enter the country ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration , böhme said those who can already speak german - and there are quite a few in turkey - wo n't have to go through any language test if they already have a school diploma and can prove they learned german at school .
for everyone else , we have to still agree on a procedure that will check if they can speak simple sentences in german .
of course there are different ways to learn german .
you can participate in a language course , but there are also possibilities to learn it through watching television or on the internet .
and you can also pick up german from relatives and friends who have returned from germany .
the integration courses offered by the government in germany are also controversial .
according to the new changes in the law , those who do n't participate in these courses can be penalized and would have to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,362 -rrb- .
but how often will the government resort to that ?
will the government revoke a person 's residency permit if he or she refuses to attend a course three times ?
that 's a wrong way of seeing the integration courses , which really are a fantastic opportunity .
many immigrants to germany who are obliged to attend these courses have done so .
two thirds of them have been women .
but the " sanctions " you 're referring to only apply to those who stubbornly refuse to attend them .
i 'd like to cite an example here .
all those who can work in germany but who fail to get any because of their poor grasp of german will receive a warning from the labor office to attend a language course .
that 's exactly what happens to a german national who , for instance , may have poor computer skills and fails to get a job because of it .
the aim is to push people to attend courses so that they can fend for themselves and their families .
the german who refuses to attend computer lessons will also have to reckon with the fact that his welfare benefits will be cut .
so the law makes no distinction between germans and immigrants .
some turkish groups have threatened to boycott the upcoming integration summit .
what do you think of their stance ?
i was very surprised to hear that because those same groups worked intensively earlier on the national integration plan and told me last week that it helped the integration of immigrants .
those who do n't accept the invitation to the summit and to talk with us are n't solving the problem .
instead they 're leaving in the lurch the people who need to be integrated the most - the second and third generation of turkish immigrants . seda serdar interviewed maria böhmer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nobel-prize winning author vs naipaul once described it as the place where " civilisation ends " .
but all is not lost , perhaps .
we discover five areas where bihar might consider itself to be ahead of other indian states .
women power bihar is the only state in india to have 50 % of places in local municipal bodies reserved for women .
babita devi says she feels empowered -lrb- pics : prashant ravi -rrb- babita devi , a thirty-something mother of two children , is one of the beneficiaries of this positive discrimination in a male-dominated society where women have traditionally lived and worked on the margins .
the wife of a small farmer , mrs devi defeated 19 contestants to win the civic election in her area and become a municipal representative .
now she works to keep her neighbourhood clean and improve its sanitation .
" for the first time in my life i have got respect and attention from my family and society .
it feels good , " she says .
the present government in bihar , run by the janata dal -lrb- united -rrb- and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , began the policy of reserving half of local municipal body seats for women .
today half of the 262,000 elected councillors to local municipalities in the state are women .
" the 50 % reservation for women in civic bodies is not only empowering women but educating them to a great extent , " says social scientist dr shaibal gupta .
speedy trials fast track courts in bihar have convicted and sentenced more criminals than courts in any other indian state in the past 18 months .
politicians have been sentenced after speedy trials the government launched speedy trials to rid the state of its " most lawless " taint - there is a murder every two hours , a rape and kidnapping reported every six hours and a bank robbery every day in the state , according to police records .
between january 2006 and may 2007 , a total of 11,665 criminals were convicted through speedy trials and sent to prison .
more than 2,500 were sentenced to life , and 21 others given the death penalty .
critics of the speedy trials express concerns about the quality of evidence and justice being dispensed in such a short time in a country where court cases typically drag on for years .
the fastest judgement in bihar was delivered by a court in 13 days flat from the date of the incident .
politicians across party lines have also been tried through speedy trials .
" the idea is to stem bihar 's burgeoning crime wave .
it has been a great success , " additional director general of police abhayanand says .
a local advocate , soni srivastva , says speedy trials make sense " if all steps from filing charges to the trial are conducted properly " .
special cops bihar is the only state in india where retired soldiers are being hired as policemen to stem the crime wave .
there are 5,000 ex-soldiers in the special force they mostly comprise the " special auxiliary police " force - about 5,000 retired soldiers were hired last year and sent to help police various districts .
since then this special force has earned plaudits for controlling crime and taking on maoist rebels .
the force has earned praise from prime minister manmohan singh who has asked other states to emulate the model .
" its been hugely successful in checking crime .
the forces are called in whenever there are law and order problems , " says mr abhyanand .
the government is planning to hire another 11,500 ex-soldiers soon to bolster the force .
on average about 100 of these soldiers-turned-policemen have been deployed in each district .
cash cow bihar has a long and tortuous history of chronically unprofitable state-owned companies and their unpaid employees taking their lives .
business is booming for the milk co-operative but sudha , a dairy co-operative , is a shining exception and one of the most successful exercises of its kind in india .
launched in 1993 , the co-operative 's revenues from a range of milk and milk products has risen from $ 73.5m in 2001-2002 to $ 136m today .
the co-operative has 6,000 outlets covering 84 towns in the state .
more than 260,000 milk farmers in the state are members of the co-operative , and a private bank has even launched a pension scheme for them .
now sudha has begun " exporting " milk to other indian states like uttar pradesh , west bengal , jharkhand and delhi .
" regular payments to milk farmers and viable economic relationship with them has led to sudha 's grand success , " says atish chandra , chief of the co-operative .
model taxes did you know that a simplified tax system conceived and launched in bihar is now being emulated by sri lanka and various african countries and has been lauded by the united nations ?
tax methods have been made simpler introduced by the municipality of patna , the state capital , in 1993 , the tax system , locally known as the " patna model of taxation " simplifies property tax rates on the basis of the local area and use of property .
" it is very methodical , " municipal commissioner rana awadhesh says .
" using this model , the state can collect a large amount of tax money with less effort from officials and tax payers . "
property is classified according to its location , construction , use -lrb- residential or commercial -rrb- , and rates fixed accordingly .
states like karnataka , uttar pradesh , gujarat , tamil nadu and madhya pradesh have adopted the same property tax model .
the un was so impressed by the taxation model that it gave a $ 30,000 award to bihar for introducing this method .

nobel-prize winning author vs naipaul once described it as the place where " civilisation ends " .
but all is not lost , perhaps .
we discover five areas where bihar might consider itself to be ahead of other indian states .
women power bihar is the only state in india to have 50 % of places in local municipal bodies reserved for women .
babita devi , a thirty-something mother of two children , is one of the beneficiaries of this positive discrimination in a male-dominated society where women have traditionally lived and worked on the margins .
the wife of a small farmer , mrs devi defeated 19 contestants to win the civic election in her area and become a municipal representative .
now she works to keep her neighbourhood clean and improve its sanitation .
" for the first time in my life i have got respect and attention from my family and society .
it feels good , " she says .
the present government in bihar , run by the janata dal -lrb- united -rrb- and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , began the policy of reserving half of local municipal body seats for women .
today half of the 262,000 elected councillors to local municipalities in the state are women .
" the 50 % reservation for women in civic bodies is not only empowering women but educating them to a great extent , " says social scientist dr shaibal gupta .
speedy trials fast track courts in bihar have convicted and sentenced more criminals than courts in any other indian state in the past 18 months .
the government launched speedy trials to rid the state of its " most lawless " taint - there is a murder every two hours , a rape and kidnapping reported every six hours and a bank robbery every day in the state , according to police records .
between january 2006 and may 2007 , a total of 11,665 criminals were convicted through speedy trials and sent to prison .
more than 2,500 were sentenced to life , and 21 others given the death penalty .
critics of the speedy trials express concerns about the quality of evidence and justice being dispensed in such a short time in a country where court cases typically drag on for years .
the fastest judgement in bihar was delivered by a court in 13 days flat from the date of the incident .
politicians across party lines have also been tried through speedy trials .
" the idea is to stem bihar 's burgeoning crime wave .
it has been a great success , " additional director general of police abhayanand says .
a local advocate , soni srivastva , says speedy trials make sense " if all steps from filing charges to the trial are conducted properly " .
special cops bihar is the only state in india where retired soldiers are being hired as policemen to stem the crime wave .
they mostly comprise the " special auxiliary police " force - about 5,000 retired soldiers were hired last year and sent to help police various districts .
since then this special force has earned plaudits for controlling crime and taking on maoist rebels .
the force has earned praise from prime minister manmohan singh who has asked other states to emulate the model .
" its been hugely successful in checking crime .
the forces are called in whenever there are law and order problems , " says mr abhyanand .
the government is planning to hire another 11,500 ex-soldiers soon to bolster the force .
on average about 100 of these soldiers-turned-policemen have been deployed in each district .
cash cow bihar has a long and tortuous history of chronically unprofitable state-owned companies and their unpaid employees taking their lives .
but sudha , a dairy co-operative , is a shining exception and one of the most successful exercises of its kind in india .
launched in 1993 , the co-operative 's revenues from a range of milk and milk products has risen from $ 73.5m in 2001-2002 to $ 136m today .
the co-operative has 6,000 outlets covering 84 towns in the state .
more than 260,000 milk farmers in the state are members of the co-operative , and a private bank has even launched a pension scheme for them .
now sudha has begun " exporting " milk to other indian states like uttar pradesh , west bengal , jharkhand and delhi .
" regular payments to milk farmers and viable economic relationship with them has led to sudha 's grand success , " says atish chandra , chief of the co-operative .
model taxes did you know that a simplified tax system conceived and launched in bihar is now being emulated by sri lanka and various african countries and has been lauded by the united nations ?
introduced by the municipality of patna , the state capital , in 1993 , the tax system , locally known as the " patna model of taxation " simplifies property tax rates on the basis of the local area and use of property .
" it is very methodical , " municipal commissioner rana awadhesh says .
" using this model , the state can collect a large amount of tax money with less effort from officials and tax payers . "
property is classified according to its location , construction , use -lrb- residential or commercial -rrb- , and rates fixed accordingly .
states like karnataka , uttar pradesh , gujarat , tamil nadu and madhya pradesh have adopted the same property tax model .
the un was so impressed by the taxation model that it gave a $ 30,000 award to bihar for introducing this method .

in dirt , showing on digital service five us , the actress plays lucy stiller , a hard-headed editor who will stop at nothing to get the story .
" i 'm pretty ruthless , " says cox .
" it 's a racy , outrageous , fun show .
there 's betrayal and deception and a lot of sex and there 's jealously and drugs - it 's pretty salacious in every way . "
dirt is cox 's highest profile role since friends .
the show is co-executive produced by her husband , david arquette .
lucy stiller fits the mould as a determined tabloid editor who makes a living out of prying into the lives of celebrities .
but , according to cox , the character has a conscience .
" i 'm an outrageous editor but i strive to always tell the truth or uncover the truth but the lengths that i will go to get the truth are maybe questionable . "
tabloid target as a celebrity with plenty of experience in dealing with the tabloids , cox says the tv role has opened her eyes to the world of paparazzi journalism .
" i understand how competitive it is , " she says .
cox says she and david arquette have a happy , scandal-free marriage " but at the same time it 's really weird - when you look at paparazzi it 's almost like sometimes they cut off their moral code .
" it 's their jobs , i understand , but it 's just a very fine line between work and hurting people . "
cox , who is happily married with a three-year old daughter , coco , points out that her life is " not that dramatic " and free of scandal .
but the former fashion model accepts that the tabloids will always be interested in her life .
" you know that if you 're going to be an actor on something that has become the zeitgeist or a part of pop culture you have to expect that you will be a target for paparazzi .
but cox says a recent encounter with the paparazzi went over the top .
she was getting into a car outside a restaurant when the vehicle was surrounded by photographers .
" my daughter was in the back seat and that was really scary because coco was like , ' mommy why are they taking my picture ? '
" it was kind of hard to explain that mommy is on a tv show and i 'm not sure why they 're that interested ...
i 'm not wearing anything outrageous , i 'm not doing anything crazy - it does seem like times are pretty tough if that 's what people are finding interesting . "
friends factor on another occasion cox says she was unnerved by the attentions of a man who had been following her car .
" i pulled up to a meeting and i looked behind me and there was a guy in a car and he bent down for what i later -lrb- discovered -rrb- was his camera - but you just do n't know .
" for that spilt second you think - crazy or paparazzi ?
you 're just not sure - sometimes it 's a little freaky . "
cox says she has been a focus of the paparazzi ever since her days on friends .
when she was pregnant there was a " frenzy " of activity .
but she says , interest in her life has never been more intense than the present time .
" since i have been doing dirt i have been more of a target for paparazzi , than i used to be .
there 's usually someone outside of my house every day . "
but the actress remains philosophical about the unwanted attention .
" i have friends that 10 photographers are sitting outside their house and so in retrospect it 's not so terrible . "

in dirt , showing on digital service five us , the actress plays lucy stiller , a hard-headed editor who will stop at nothing to get the story .
" i 'm pretty ruthless , " says cox .
" it 's a racy , outrageous , fun show .
there 's betrayal and deception and a lot of sex and there 's jealously and drugs - it 's pretty salacious in every way . "
dirt is cox 's highest profile role since friends .
the show is co-executive produced by her husband , david arquette .
lucy stiller fits the mould as a determined tabloid editor who makes a living out of prying into the lives of celebrities .
but , according to cox , the character has a conscience .
" i 'm an outrageous editor but i strive to always tell the truth or uncover the truth but the lengths that i will go to get the truth are maybe questionable . "
tabloid target as a celebrity with plenty of experience in dealing with the tabloids , cox says the tv role has opened her eyes to the world of paparazzi journalism .
" i understand how competitive it is , " she says .
cox says she and david arquette have a happy , scandal-free marriage " but at the same time it 's really weird - when you look at paparazzi it 's almost like sometimes they cut off their moral code .
" it 's their jobs , i understand , but it 's just a very fine line between work and hurting people . "
cox , who is happily married with a three-year old daughter , coco , points out that her life is " not that dramatic " and free of scandal .
but the former fashion model accepts that the tabloids will always be interested in her life .
" you know that if you 're going to be an actor on something that has become the zeitgeist or a part of pop culture you have to expect that you will be a target for paparazzi .
but cox says a recent encounter with the paparazzi went over the top .
she was getting into a car outside a restaurant when the vehicle was surrounded by photographers .
" my daughter was in the back seat and that was really scary because coco was like , ' mommy why are they taking my picture ? '
" it was kind of hard to explain that mommy is on a tv show and i 'm not sure why they 're that interested ...
i 'm not wearing anything outrageous , i 'm not doing anything crazy - it does seem like times are pretty tough if that 's what people are finding interesting . "

as a result the ps3 will now cost $ 500 -lrb- £ 249 -rrb- , between $ 100 and $ 200 more than versions of the microsoft xbox 360 and twice as much as the nintendo wii .
the xbox 360 and wii have been significantly outselling the japanese firm 's ps3 in the us market .
the news came as microsoft said it would not be cutting the japanese price of its xbox to lift lacklustre sales .
microsoft made the announcement a week after it said it was spending $ 1bn to repair problems with the xbox 360 .
japan problems the xbox price tag of about 38,000 yen -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- is " very competitive " and below that of the console 's us price , microsoft japan 's vice president said .
xbox sales in japan have been lagging behind those of rivals - sony 's playstation 3 and nintendo 's wii .
according to games magazine publisher enterbrain , microsoft has sold 122,565 xbox consoles in japan during the first six months of the year .
that compares with 1.78 million nintendo wii sales and 503,554 sony ps3 sales .
however , it is a different story in the us market with nintendo and microsoft outselling their rival several times over " our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum , " said sony entertainment america chief executive jack tretton .
" we 've gotten our production issues behind us on the playstation 3 , reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers , and our attitude is the sooner the better . "
the move also comes just ahead of the launch of the latest version of the ps3 .
the new console will boast an improved 80-gigabyte hard drive and is expected to sell for around $ 600 .
sony computer entertainment europe is expected to make an announcement at the e3 event - one of the biggest conferences in the game industry calendar - about the new console on thursday .
