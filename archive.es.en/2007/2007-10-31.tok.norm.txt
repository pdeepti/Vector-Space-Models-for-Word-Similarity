" in a letter to airbus employees , enders claimed his innocence . according to the financial times deutschland , which quoted sources close to eads 's aerospace unit , " other managers " are considering following enders 's lead . an eads spokesman on monday told reuters that the company was fully cooperating with the amf and said eads 's corporate communications had been legally appropriate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 31.10.2007 german film tackles racism through humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leroy and his girlfriend eva in a scene from the film neo-nazism , racism and xenophobia are nothing new to cinema audiences , but tackling them through comedy is somewhat rare .
the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society . " we have minorities and we have people with different looks and they all live here and they all have their place in german culture , said stoltz .
" it 's just exaggerating it a bit so that we can see it in a lighter way . "
bildunterschrift : the film leroy shows germans of all shapes and sizes " we have this picture in mind that germans are only white and blonde haired and blue eyed and we forget that we have become an immigrant country , " he added . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" finally people are living what has always been demanded , " migration expert thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwi -rrb- told the associated press .
" that is , higher mobility in favor of better professional opportunities . "

in search of jobs - and sun indeed , most of those who move away eventually return home , a departure from the past .
" the character of emigration has changed entirely , " straubhaar said .
" today it 's only a temporary professional phase . "
this was also the case for the 1,900 older germans , above the age of 50 , who chose to leave their home country , straubhaar told ap .
drawn by lower costs of living and mild weather , this group was most likely to move to spain , according to the statisticians .
but they , too , were very likely to return to germany .
" one goes home to die , " straubhaar said .

when a swiss tabloid launched a campaign last week asking the nation how many germans switzerland can stomach , it did more to highlight an old inferiority complex than to reveal the dawning of a new anti-german age .

dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .

dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .

we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .
companies have to be given time to change their technology .
currently , that 's happening by building new plants .
we have attained significantly higher efficiency and , therefore , lower co2 emissions .
the shutting down of old brown coal plants and the building of new ones has brought germany far in cutting co2 - nothing else . does mibrag invest in alternative energy ? mibrag is a coal distributor .
that 's not our job .
our job is to provide coal to large power plants . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , following a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh . " india and germany recognize the urgent need to find effective and practical solutions to address concerns regarding climate change and its implications for humankind , " the joint statement said , as reported by the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with burgeoning economies , like india and china , are becoming big polluters " these would include mitigation and adaptation strategies in a manner that supports further economic and social development in particular of developing countries , " the statement said . merkel urges india to do more but merkel , a former environment minister who has made global warming a top priority on her international agenda , also urged india to do more to combat climate change .
she said germany is willing to help new delhi use energy more efficiently by sharing technology to avoid " mistakes we made in the industrialized countries , " she said , according to reuters . the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- conference is scheduled for december in indonesia to hash out a new comprehensive agreement . but emerging economies like china and india , and some of the world 's top polluters , oppose tough new regulations .
they argue that such measures could strangle economic growth .
they also say that industrialized countries , such as the united states , australia and the eu members , have produced the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions in the past and should bear a larger burden in the climate change fight . however , india - one of the fastest-growing economies in the world - is expected to reveal a national plan to combat global warming by the end of the year .
analysts in india have said the country has already made major inroads regarding energy efficiency . nuclear possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has more than pleasantries in mind in india singh also announced at the joint press conference tuesday , following his meeting with merkel , that he was still trying to push through a nuclear energy deal with the united states .
singh has said that an agreement would help india meet its burgeoning energy needs . merkel welcomed the move and eyed chances for more business should india enter an international network of civil nuclear commerce . " from the point of view of germany , we would like to see india incorporated into the international -lrb- nuclear safeguards -rrb- regime ... then germany and india could do a lot together , " she said , according to the afp news agency . until now , singh 's nuclear plan has been blocked by coalition partners . merkel 's visit to india is aimed at improving economic ties between the two countries .
accompanied by a high-level business delegation , merkel called for a strategic partnership between new delhi and berlin . trade between the two countries has already reached 10.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .

" it raises two threats : to our national identity and regarding property in poland abandoned by germans , " kaczynski said in an interview with the daily rzeczpospolita paper , donald tusk , waiting on the sidelines to become prime minister , has vowed to end the policies that often left warsaw the odd man out at eu meetings . the center-right civic platform party led by tusk won the oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .
companies have to be given time to change their technology .
currently , that 's happening by building new plants .
we have attained significantly higher efficiency and , therefore , lower co2 emissions .
the shutting down of old brown coal plants and the building of new ones has brought germany far in cutting co2 - nothing else . does mibrag invest in alternative energy ? mibrag is a coal distributor .
that 's not our job .
our job is to provide coal to large power plants . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .

the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .
companies have to be given time to change their technology .
currently , that 's happening by building new plants .
we have attained significantly higher efficiency and , therefore , lower co2 emissions .
the shutting down of old brown coal plants and the building of new ones has brought germany far in cutting co2 - nothing else . does mibrag invest in alternative energy ? mibrag is a coal distributor .
that 's not our job .
our job is to provide coal to large power plants . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society .

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode .

" it raises two threats : to our national identity and regarding property in poland abandoned by germans , " kaczynski said in an interview with the daily rzeczpospolita paper , donald tusk , waiting on the sidelines to become prime minister , has vowed to end the policies that often left warsaw the odd man out at eu meetings . the center-right civic platform party led by tusk won the oct .
21 parliamentary election , ousting lech 's twin brother , jaroslaw , from the office of prime minister . property worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civic platform party wants warmer relations between poland and the eu at an eu summit in lisbon just before elections in poland , the polish delegation led by lech kaczynski argued that the eu charter was at odds with deeply catholic country 's stance , notably in its views on gay rights .
both lech and jaroslaw kaczynski have also said a charter could lead to an easing of anti-abortion laws in the predominantly roman catholic nation . furthermore , the conservative kaczynski government argued that the european court of justice could use the charter to force poland to return confiscated german property to germans expelled after world war ii .
around a third of present-day poland was part of pre-war germany . last week , the european commission dismissed the notion that polish adoption of the rights charter would open the door to german claims since eu law does not regulate land ownership issues . this month , the president and his twin brother , jaroslaw , had agreed to a new eu reform treaty but , together with britain , secured an opt-out from the fundamental rights charter . the reform treaty aims to streamline the eu 's functioning after its expansion from 15 to 27 members , while the charter binds eu institutions to respect the basic rights of its citizens . tusk to be appointed prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the civic platform donald tusk and his family just after oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .
companies have to be given time to change their technology .
currently , that 's happening by building new plants .
we have attained significantly higher efficiency and , therefore , lower co2 emissions .
the shutting down of old brown coal plants and the building of new ones has brought germany far in cutting co2 - nothing else . does mibrag invest in alternative energy ? mibrag is a coal distributor .
that 's not our job .
our job is to provide coal to large power plants . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" finally people are living what has always been demanded , " migration expert thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwi -rrb- told the associated press .

in search of jobs - and sun indeed , most of those who move away eventually return home , a departure from the past .
" the character of emigration has changed entirely , " straubhaar said .
" today it 's only a temporary professional phase . "
this was also the case for the 1,900 older germans , above the age of 50 , who chose to leave their home country , straubhaar told ap .
drawn by lower costs of living and mild weather , this group was most likely to move to spain , according to the statisticians .
but they , too , were very likely to return to germany .
" one goes home to die , " straubhaar said .
germany 's population was 82.3 million last year , of which slightly more than 7 million were foreigners . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to airbus employees , enders claimed his innocence . according to the financial times deutschland , which quoted sources close to eads 's aerospace unit , " other managers " are considering following enders 's lead . an eads spokesman on monday told reuters that the company was fully cooperating with the amf and said eads 's corporate communications had been legally appropriate .

fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 , on its internet site , quoting an eads spokesman . the action followed a similar one filed " a few days earlier " by the european aeronautic defense and space company itself , the newspaper said . " mr. enders has the full support of eads , " it quoted the company spokesman as saying . selling before shares plunged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a380 delivery took longer than expected french and german judicial authorities are investigating possible insider trading of eads shares in late 2005 and early 2006 before it emerged that airbus would have to delay deliveries of its flagship a380 superjumbo jet . news of the delays on june 13 , 2006 caused eads shares to plunge by more than 26 percent the following day . france 's le monde newspaper reported saturday that the french stock market regulator amf decided to widen the probe into alleged insider dealing at eads to examine whether the european consortium had deliberately put out " misleading information " to the stock market . in early october , the french newspaper le figaro revealed that the amf was investigating the sales of eads shares prior to june 13 . a " preliminary note " sent to the paris prosecutor 's office indicates suspicion that around 20 eads directors , along with two core shareholders - the french media and defense group lagardere , and german automaker daimler - might be involved in the trading scandal . the preliminary report mentions " massive insider trading " by eads directors , but the final amf report is not expected until early next year . enders decries " criminal " treatment lagardere has already said it would file a complaint following the newspaper publication to obtain compensation because it charged that terms of the report had led to " interpretations -lrb- in the media -rrb- which led to unfounded accusations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders , left , with ex-co-ceo noel forgeard , who resigned in july enders , who was co-president of eads in june 2006 , said a few days after the report in le figaro that he felt he had been " treated like a criminal " and " stigmatized " by " unfounded criticism . " in a letter to airbus employees , enders claimed his innocence . according to the financial times deutschland , which quoted sources close to eads 's aerospace unit , " other managers " are considering following enders 's lead . an eads spokesman on monday told reuters that the company was fully cooperating with the amf and said eads 's corporate communications had been legally appropriate .

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" india and germany recognize the urgent need to find effective and practical solutions to address concerns regarding climate change and its implications for humankind , " the joint statement said , as reported by the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with burgeoning economies , like india and china , are becoming big polluters " these would include mitigation and adaptation strategies in a manner that supports further economic and social development in particular of developing countries , " the statement said . merkel urges india to do more but merkel , a former environment minister who has made global warming a top priority on her international agenda , also urged india to do more to combat climate change .

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society . " we have minorities and we have people with different looks and they all live here and they all have their place in german culture , said stoltz .
" it 's just exaggerating it a bit so that we can see it in a lighter way . "
bildunterschrift : the film leroy shows germans of all shapes and sizes " we have this picture in mind that germans are only white and blonde haired and blue eyed and we forget that we have become an immigrant country , " he added . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it raises two threats : to our national identity and regarding property in poland abandoned by germans , " kaczynski said in an interview with the daily rzeczpospolita paper , donald tusk , waiting on the sidelines to become prime minister , has vowed to end the policies that often left warsaw the odd man out at eu meetings . the center-right civic platform party led by tusk won the oct .
21 parliamentary election , ousting lech 's twin brother , jaroslaw , from the office of prime minister . property worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civic platform party wants warmer relations between poland and the eu at an eu summit in lisbon just before elections in poland , the polish delegation led by lech kaczynski argued that the eu charter was at odds with deeply catholic country 's stance , notably in its views on gay rights .
both lech and jaroslaw kaczynski have also said a charter could lead to an easing of anti-abortion laws in the predominantly roman catholic nation . furthermore , the conservative kaczynski government argued that the european court of justice could use the charter to force poland to return confiscated german property to germans expelled after world war ii .
around a third of present-day poland was part of pre-war germany . last week , the european commission dismissed the notion that polish adoption of the rights charter would open the door to german claims since eu law does not regulate land ownership issues . this month , the president and his twin brother , jaroslaw , had agreed to a new eu reform treaty but , together with britain , secured an opt-out from the fundamental rights charter . the reform treaty aims to streamline the eu 's functioning after its expansion from 15 to 27 members , while the charter binds eu institutions to respect the basic rights of its citizens . tusk to be appointed prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the civic platform donald tusk and his family just after oct .
21 elections tusk has said he is taking kaczynski 's concerns seriously : " i believe it is rather in poland 's interest to sign up to the charter but i can not ignore signals opposing it , coming also from the head of state , " tusk said in a television interview late on tuesday , according to the reuters news agency . reuters also reported that tusk hopes to meet with president kaczynski to discuss poland 's position as soon as he is nominated prime minister . poland 's newly elected parliament meets for the first time this monday ; kaczynski will then have two weeks to nominate tusk . should he refuse , parliament - where the civic platform and its smaller coalition partner now have a majority - would appoint tusk . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it raises two threats : to our national identity and regarding property in poland abandoned by germans , " kaczynski said in an interview with the daily rzeczpospolita paper , donald tusk , waiting on the sidelines to become prime minister , has vowed to end the policies that often left warsaw the odd man out at eu meetings . the center-right civic platform party led by tusk won the oct .
21 parliamentary election , ousting lech 's twin brother , jaroslaw , from the office of prime minister . property worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civic platform party wants warmer relations between poland and the eu at an eu summit in lisbon just before elections in poland , the polish delegation led by lech kaczynski argued that the eu charter was at odds with deeply catholic country 's stance , notably in its views on gay rights .
both lech and jaroslaw kaczynski have also said a charter could lead to an easing of anti-abortion laws in the predominantly roman catholic nation . furthermore , the conservative kaczynski government argued that the european court of justice could use the charter to force poland to return confiscated german property to germans expelled after world war ii .
around a third of present-day poland was part of pre-war germany . last week , the european commission dismissed the notion that polish adoption of the rights charter would open the door to german claims since eu law does not regulate land ownership issues . this month , the president and his twin brother , jaroslaw , had agreed to a new eu reform treaty but , together with britain , secured an opt-out from the fundamental rights charter . the reform treaty aims to streamline the eu 's functioning after its expansion from 15 to 27 members , while the charter binds eu institutions to respect the basic rights of its citizens . tusk to be appointed prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the civic platform donald tusk and his family just after oct .

dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .

dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .

" it raises two threats : to our national identity and regarding property in poland abandoned by germans , " kaczynski said in an interview with the daily rzeczpospolita paper , donald tusk , waiting on the sidelines to become prime minister , has vowed to end the policies that often left warsaw the odd man out at eu meetings . the center-right civic platform party led by tusk won the oct .

both lech and jaroslaw kaczynski have also said a charter could lead to an easing of anti-abortion laws in the predominantly roman catholic nation . furthermore , the conservative kaczynski government argued that the european court of justice could use the charter to force poland to return confiscated german property to germans expelled after world war ii .
around a third of present-day poland was part of pre-war germany . last week , the european commission dismissed the notion that polish adoption of the rights charter would open the door to german claims since eu law does not regulate land ownership issues . this month , the president and his twin brother , jaroslaw , had agreed to a new eu reform treaty but , together with britain , secured an opt-out from the fundamental rights charter . the reform treaty aims to streamline the eu 's functioning after its expansion from 15 to 27 members , while the charter binds eu institutions to respect the basic rights of its citizens . tusk to be appointed prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the civic platform donald tusk and his family just after oct .

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .

many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.10.2007 brown coal boss says modernizing plants has cut co2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown coal plants are known for their high co2 emissions the mibrag coal company has relocated an entire town and its medieval church in order to mine for brown coal .
dw-world.de asked why people were pushed out for an environmentally unfriendly energy source . a romanesque-style stone church arrived wednesday at its new home in eastern germany after being evicted from the spot it had occupied for at least 700 years .
on oct .
25 , the emmaus church in the village of heuersdorf , near leipzig , was loaded onto a huge flatbed trailer for 12-kilometer -lrb- 7.5-mile -rrb- trip to the neighboring town of borna .
the 750-ton church was inched into its new home in time for reformation day on wednesday , when lutherans traditionally honor the 16th-century church reformer martin luther . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mibrag paid three million euros to transport heuersdorf medieval church the church had to be moved because heuersdorf is about to be dug up .
the mibrag mining company spent 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to move the church after the regional legislature approved plans to mine the ground heuersdorf sits on to get at some 50 million tons of lignite , or brown coal , to supply a nearby power station .
village authorities fought the plan for years but lost their appeal in germany 's constitutional court in 2005 . dw-world.de talked with heiner krieg from mibrag about the relocation of the village 's residents . dw-world.de : mr. krieg , how many of the heuersdorf residents have already been relocated ? heiner krieg : originally , just over 300 .
now there are about 60 still living there .
most of them will be relocated by the beginning of march next year .
the remaining 20 or so will move by the end of 2008 to another location . are the moves going according to plan or have there been problems with the residents ? no , it 's going according to plan .
we 're in agreement with the citizens .
there are certainly discussions here and there , but essentially they 've all agreed to relocate .
everyone has their new plot of land and they know where they 're going to build , or have already started building . there 's a small town called hagenest where many of the residents are moving .
the structural work on the houses has already been completed there , which is why we 're hopeful that a large part of the relocations can take place in march . what do the residents receive as compensation ? they receive a whole package .
first of all there 's the house , which is not estimated at the market price but at replacement value .
this amount is currently significantly higher , particularly in eastern germany . all together , the compensation package is worth between 110,000 and 120,000 euros -lrb- about $ 159,000 to $ 173,000 -rrb- , in addition to the house .
this includes engineering work , connection fees , notary fees , lawyer fees , moving costs , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy has also come under fire for being environmentally unfriendly why does mibrag find it necessary to expel people from their homes ? we ca n't decide how nature formed the deposits .
the problem is that heuersdorf lies on an area with good coal .
the various interests at stake are balanced and taken into consideration and , according to the law , the minority has to accept the interest of the majority .
we know that this is a burden for the minority and we 're doing everything humanly possible to make the situation easier . we are frequently asked this question , but i have to say that many people have also left this area because there were n't any jobs .
and no one asks about those people . we 're grateful to all of the heuersdorf residents who said from the beginning that they were willing to make the sacrifice for the common good in exchange for fair compensation .
then there were the rest who said they were n't interested at all . you mentioned high unemployment in the region .
are heuersdorf residents also employed in the mines ? yes , we have employed heuersdorf residents before , when possible .
of course others work elsewhere , but where we 've been able to help , we have . it 's well known that both mining and burning brown coal are harmful to the environment .
how can mibrag justify establishing more mines ? this is n't a new mine but the continuation and maintenance of one of the most modern power plants in existence .
it has so been seen from this perspective .
i do n't think that germany will turn away from nuclear power and from brown coal at the same time .
that would send germany back to the stone age . so you do n't foresee an end to brown coal ? no .
it 's a question of technology , above all .
companies have to be given time to change their technology .
currently , that 's happening by building new plants .
we have attained significantly higher efficiency and , therefore , lower co2 emissions .
the shutting down of old brown coal plants and the building of new ones has brought germany far in cutting co2 - nothing else . does mibrag invest in alternative energy ? mibrag is a coal distributor .
that 's not our job .
our job is to provide coal to large power plants . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 , showed that up to five billions euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- could be saved by private households and in the larger economy as a result of energy-saving measures . the measures are part of a climate plan provisionally approved by the german cabinet during an august retreat . according to the interim report released wednesday , the combined effects of the plan 's measures could also lead to a reduction of co2 emissions by 36.6 percent by 2020 . net savings : five billion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel reductions in the use of coal , oil and gas and increased efficiency , for example , could lead to savings of up to 36 billion euros , gabriel said .
costs for investing in the expansion of renewable energy sources or using environmentally friendly technologies would likely total around 31 billion , according to the study . cost savings would stem , for example , from improved insulation of homes and buildings . the results of the interim study are to flow into the german government 's decision when it is to give final approval to the 30-point climate plan in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .

at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .

to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .

is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .

30 , following a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh . " india and germany recognize the urgent need to find effective and practical solutions to address concerns regarding climate change and its implications for humankind , " the joint statement said , as reported by the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with burgeoning economies , like india and china , are becoming big polluters " these would include mitigation and adaptation strategies in a manner that supports further economic and social development in particular of developing countries , " the statement said . merkel urges india to do more but merkel , a former environment minister who has made global warming a top priority on her international agenda , also urged india to do more to combat climate change .
she said germany is willing to help new delhi use energy more efficiently by sharing technology to avoid " mistakes we made in the industrialized countries , " she said , according to reuters . the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- conference is scheduled for december in indonesia to hash out a new comprehensive agreement . but emerging economies like china and india , and some of the world 's top polluters , oppose tough new regulations .
they argue that such measures could strangle economic growth .
they also say that industrialized countries , such as the united states , australia and the eu members , have produced the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions in the past and should bear a larger burden in the climate change fight . however , india - one of the fastest-growing economies in the world - is expected to reveal a national plan to combat global warming by the end of the year .
analysts in india have said the country has already made major inroads regarding energy efficiency . nuclear possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has more than pleasantries in mind in india singh also announced at the joint press conference tuesday , following his meeting with merkel , that he was still trying to push through a nuclear energy deal with the united states .
singh has said that an agreement would help india meet its burgeoning energy needs . merkel welcomed the move and eyed chances for more business should india enter an international network of civil nuclear commerce . " from the point of view of germany , we would like to see india incorporated into the international -lrb- nuclear safeguards -rrb- regime ... then germany and india could do a lot together , " she said , according to the afp news agency . until now , singh 's nuclear plan has been blocked by coalition partners . merkel 's visit to india is aimed at improving economic ties between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

costs for investing in the expansion of renewable energy sources or using environmentally friendly technologies would likely total around 31 billion , according to the study . cost savings would stem , for example , from improved insulation of homes and buildings . the results of the interim study are to flow into the german government 's decision when it is to give final approval to the 30-point climate plan in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 31.10.2007 german film tackles racism through humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leroy and his girlfriend eva in a scene from the film neo-nazism , racism and xenophobia are nothing new to cinema audiences , but tackling them through comedy is somewhat rare .
the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society . " we have minorities and we have people with different looks and they all live here and they all have their place in german culture , said stoltz .
" it 's just exaggerating it a bit so that we can see it in a lighter way . "
bildunterschrift : the film leroy shows germans of all shapes and sizes " we have this picture in mind that germans are only white and blonde haired and blue eyed and we forget that we have become an immigrant country , " he added . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new german film " leroy " breaks all the rules by using laughter to combat racism . german writer and director armin völckers ' debut film " leroy " is a romantic comedy about a mixed-race boy with an afro hairstyle falling in love with a blonde-haired girl whose brothers are neo-nazis . not only does the film push the boundaries by dealing with serious issues in a comic light , but it is also the first german film to have a black german , leroy , as the main character . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tackling racism through humor " instead of putting your finger up and being didactical or politically correct , we wanted to open hearts with humor and make another point in the discussion of what is germany and what do germans look like , " said the film 's producer oliver stoltz . the formula has worked so far .
the film been popular with young audiences in germany and it won the audience award at the 2007 tokyo international film festival on october 28 . a comic risk using comedy to deal with topics such as xenophobia and racism was risky , especially for a debut film . " for example , we were making fun of the skinhead characters on the set and we thought of a lot of things that other people did not find funny , " said director völckers .
" to them , skinheads were evil and they could n't laugh about them right away .
we had to find other ways to approach that . " according to völckers , about 70 percent of the jokes the crew came up with were out of the question .
many of the things that neo-nazis would usually say to an african-german were not used because they were too degrading to leroy 's character . to explore the situation where a black boy rings the door of a neo-nazi family in germany , völckers had to stay in a fairly light mode . " we had to seek a refuge that german humor has sought since the war , " he said .
" if you look at the tradition of german humor , it 's all really silly .
they ’ re harmless little boys playing pranks , " he said . exaggerating reality while the exaggerated stereotypes portrayed in the film might appear unrealistic , the film does present elements found in contemporary german society . " we have minorities and we have people with different looks and they all live here and they all have their place in german culture , said stoltz .
" it 's just exaggerating it a bit so that we can see it in a lighter way . "
bildunterschrift : the film leroy shows germans of all shapes and sizes " we have this picture in mind that germans are only white and blonde haired and blue eyed and we forget that we have become an immigrant country , " he added . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , following a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh . " india and germany recognize the urgent need to find effective and practical solutions to address concerns regarding climate change and its implications for humankind , " the joint statement said , as reported by the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with burgeoning economies , like india and china , are becoming big polluters " these would include mitigation and adaptation strategies in a manner that supports further economic and social development in particular of developing countries , " the statement said . merkel urges india to do more but merkel , a former environment minister who has made global warming a top priority on her international agenda , also urged india to do more to combat climate change .
she said germany is willing to help new delhi use energy more efficiently by sharing technology to avoid " mistakes we made in the industrialized countries , " she said , according to reuters . the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- conference is scheduled for december in indonesia to hash out a new comprehensive agreement . but emerging economies like china and india , and some of the world 's top polluters , oppose tough new regulations .
they argue that such measures could strangle economic growth .
they also say that industrialized countries , such as the united states , australia and the eu members , have produced the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions in the past and should bear a larger burden in the climate change fight . however , india - one of the fastest-growing economies in the world - is expected to reveal a national plan to combat global warming by the end of the year .
analysts in india have said the country has already made major inroads regarding energy efficiency . nuclear possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has more than pleasantries in mind in india singh also announced at the joint press conference tuesday , following his meeting with merkel , that he was still trying to push through a nuclear energy deal with the united states .
singh has said that an agreement would help india meet its burgeoning energy needs . merkel welcomed the move and eyed chances for more business should india enter an international network of civil nuclear commerce . " from the point of view of germany , we would like to see india incorporated into the international -lrb- nuclear safeguards -rrb- regime ... then germany and india could do a lot together , " she said , according to the afp news agency . until now , singh 's nuclear plan has been blocked by coalition partners . merkel 's visit to india is aimed at improving economic ties between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.10.2007 germany faces shortage of nuclear safety experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atomic egg was the shining face of germany 's nuclear future fifty years ago , germany 's first nuclear reactor was built near munich .
dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to an safety expert about standards in today 's german atomic plants and the possible problems for the future . the atomic egg research facility near munich was the site of groundbreaking research in the fields of physics , biology , chemistry and medicine .
experiments carried out there also helped , in part , pave the way towards the setting up of germany 's nuclear industry . it was an age when there was an almost naive belief in nuclear power .
fifty years on , the country is poised to phase-out atomic energy in 2020 . dw-world.de spoke to physicist christian küppers , of the darmstadt öko-institut and a member of the government 's advisory radiation protection committee , about safety standards in german nuclear plants and potential problems ahead . dw-world.de : how safe are the german nuclear power plants and research reactors in international comparison ? christian küppers : you ca n't really generalize .
there are old and new ones , and those in the middle .
the old ones are not only dated in the sense they 've been operational for many years and subject to wear and tear .
safety requirements are now a lot higher .
that means that long before germany agreed to phase out nuclear power , people realized the old reactors do not meet current standards for new plants .
for example , if you think about the debate after september 11 , 2001 and the danger of air attacks , the new plants in germany are designed to withstand an air crash , whereas the old ones are not .
these are things that you ca n't change by making alterations . is this the case in other countries ? most other countries have not considered this kind of construction to protect against the danger of air crashes .
that also goes for countries like the united states and france that have a lot of reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's power plants are now firmly in middle age are the reactors here in germany older than in other countries ? german plants are relatively old in comparison with other countries .
if you look at france , for example , the oldest reactors in france are the two blocks in fessenheim on the german border .
they were built more recently than biblis b and brunsbüttel .
my theory is that if you do n't have problems with people opposing atomic energy and you do n't face any problems building new plants then it 's easier to close the old reactors and build new ones that are more economical to run .
it 's a rather different story , if you know that everyone will be happy if an older reactor gets closed down , but you will not be allowed to build a new one .
i do not say that you have to be in favor of atomic energy for that reason .
so although there were once greater numbers of old reactors in france , they have now been closed down . there were technical problems this summer in nuclear power plants in brunsbüttel and krümmel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
do these also indicate a problem with the structure of the safety supervisory systems in germany ? it is primarily the job of the german states to supervise safety .
the government can step in if it realizes that the state is not carrying out this job properly .
it varies from state to state .
if you identify deficits in schleswig-holstein you ca n't say this reveals a general deficit in supervision in germany .
i think enough rules exist to allow proper supervision .
the authorities have considerable powers .
they can appoint experts to step in for example and carry out checks .
the fact that they do n't always do this is another matter .
what could be a problem , particularly in the future , is that there are practically no young scientists who are very well qualified in the area of reactor safety .
that means that both the operators and the authorities are competing for qualified staff .
at the same time a lot of people are retiring . why is that the case ?
is it linked to germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power ? it is not directly linked .
it has become apparent over the last 10 to 15 years .
the fact has been clear for some time that no new plants will be built in the foreseeable future so the industry did n't offer such good prospects for the future . is that linked to the green movement ? yes .
but i have to say that the last plants were actually commissioned in 1980 or thereabouts .
after that the electricity operators did n't order any new atomic power plants in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition to nuclear power has had unexpected effects how can the problem of finding new blood be addressed ? i know via the radiation protection commission that chairs in the universities were no longer filled when professors retired .
you have to ensure the money is there to retain such posts .
on the other hand , you also have to publicize what is on offer .
at first glance , it might look as if there will be no jobs after 2020 , but after that there will be the phases when you have to dismantle plants .
that will last at least a decade or two .
to that extent , there are long-term prospects . research reactors in germany are not included in the general nuclear phase-out .
do n't they pose a potential danger ? a large research reactor also has a radioactive stock .
it is much smaller than that of a normal nuclear power plant , but it is still big enough that it could have a catastrophic effect on the surrounding countryside .
it would be a relatively restricted area , but if you look at garching , then if the wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction and in the event of the worst possible accident , then it could mean that munich would have to be evacuated . there has been some criticism of the successor to the " atomic egg " in garching .
is it justified ? the reactor was built using a type of uranium that can be directly used to build atomic weapons after enrichment .
that occurred at a time when it was internationally agreed that we should be moving away from its usage and when germany was also switching to less enriched uranium .
we very much regretted the fact that it became operation using this type of uranium . what do you see as one of the most important tasks facing the nuclear sector in germany ? a permanent storage facility is needed for highly radioactive waste from reprocessing .
up to now , we have only explored the suitability of gorleben .
it would be good if swift progress were made .
at least one other location should be explored and then a decision should be made about which is the most suitable and work should then be started .
this is a problem that politicians like to postpone because it 's not an issue that is likely to win them any friends .
but it is a problem that has to be solved .
i think that it is technically possible .
but it has to be done .
to keep on storing the waste above ground - and it will remain there for at least another two decades in any case because the storage facility wo n't be ready - is the most dangerous option . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement , the organising committee apologised , saying the ticket centre had underestimated demand .
in the first hour after sales opened , the ticket website received more than 200,000 ticket requests per second .
customers eager to buy the first-come , first-served tickets also jammed phone lines and queued at designated banks .
a lottery in june allocated the first round of 1.6m tickets to be made available for next year 's games .
but the opening of this second round , in which 1.8m tickets are up for grabs , has now been suspended until monday for technical work to the ticket sales system .
' preparation flawed ' " we sincerely apologise to the public , " said the organising committee in a statement .
" demand was much higher than the ticket centre estimated and flaws existed in preparation work that caused inconveniences for applicants , " the statement said .
the ticketing website received more than 8m visits in the first hour , while at least 2m people called the telephone hotline .
huge queues formed outside designated bank of china branches , with some customers starting to queue hours before the branches opened .
but only 9,000 tickets were reported to have been sold in the first two hours .
patriotic china will eventually sell about 7m tickets to the games in three phases , with about three-quarters going to residents of china and the rest to overseas buyers .
china wants to stage the perfect olympic games and would like every seat filled with cheering , patriotic supporters , say correspondents .
organisers warned that people hoping to see the most popular events , including gymnastics , table tennis and the opening and closing ceremonies , may be disappointed .

prakash karat , head of the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , said the government should complete its term .
there have been growing signs the government may shelve the deal after communist allies opposed to it threatened to withdraw their support .
such a move could trigger early general elections in india .
the deal would give india access to civilian nuclear technology and fuel even though it has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
left-wing parties in india fear the agreement could give the us too much influence over indian foreign policy .
us companies , meanwhile , are hoping the deal would pave the way for lucrative contracts in india .
' integrity unquestioned ' the leader of the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- , which is staunchly opposed to the deal , said his party did not favour early elections . "
our differing view on the agreement does not mean that we do not have respect for the prime minister " prakash karat , communist party " we are also of the view that there should not be early elections and there is no reason why the government should not complete its full term , " mr karat told the telegraph newspaper .
he said there had been differences between the communists and prime minister manmohan singh on the nuclear agreement .
" we recognise he -lsb- mr singh -rsb- has strong convictions on the soundness and utility of the agreement .
our differing view on the agreement does not mean that we do not have respect for the prime minister , " mr karat said .
" his integrity is unquestioned . "
mr karat said the prime minister would not lose his standing if he continued in office by shelving the deal .
" as the prime minister is heading a coalition government without the backing of a parliamentary majority for the deal , his not going ahead despite his firm conviction that it is a good deal will not detract from his stature , " he said .
correspondents say that although mr karat 's statements did not indicate a softening of the leftists ' stand on the deal , it is aimed at dispelling speculation that they have anything personal against mr singh .
' some delay ' mr singh said on monday that the controversial deal was not yet dead , and he was still trying to evolve a consensus .
recent weeks have seen rounds of haggling between india 's governing coalition and left-wing parties which support it in parliament .
" there is some delay but we have not reached the end of the road , " mr singh told a joint news conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the indian capital on monday .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also stressed that she wants to move forward on the nuclear deal with india .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- monks return to streets of burma bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:31 gmt , wednesday , 31 october 2007 monks return to streets of burma more than 100 monks have marched in central burma , the first time they have returned to the streets since last month 's bloody crackdown on protests .
the monks chanted and prayed as they marched through pakokku , the site of an incident last month that triggered pro-democracy protests nationwide .
the government said 10 people died during the crackdown , but diplomats believe the toll was much higher .
thousands more - many of them monks - were thought to have been detained .
separately , the human rights watch organisation has accused the burmese army of forcibly recruiting children to cover gaps left by a lack of adult recruits .
envoy 's return pakokku is a centre of buddhist learning about 630km -lrb- 390 miles -rrb- north-west of the main burmese city of rangoon .
reports that soldiers had beaten up monks there on 6 september gave momentum to protests that began on 19 august over fuel price rises .
witnesses at wednesday 's march said the monks did not make any overt political statements but that the rally was clearly in defiance of the junta .
in the wake of the crackdown on protesters last month , public gatherings of monks in burma have been banned and many monasteries remain deserted .
according to the bbc 's asia correspondent andrew harding , there is no way of telling whether this new demonstration is the start of another wave of protests .
one monk who was on the march told the democratic voice of burma , a norway-based radio station run by dissident journalists : " we are continuing our protest from last month as we have not yet achieved any of the demands we asked for .
" our demands are for lower commodity prices , national reconciliation and immediate release of -lsb- pro-democracy leader -rsb- aung san suu kyi and all the political prisoners . "
aung nyo min , the thai-based director of the human rights education institute of burma , said of the rally : " this is very significant ... we are very encouraged to see the monks are taking up action and taking up peaceful demonstrations in burma . "
' systemic abuse ' there are hundreds of thousands of monks in burma .
they are highly revered and the clergy has historically been prominent in political protests .
the crackdown on protests sparked international action , with the united states and european union imposing sanctions and embargoes .
united nations envoy ibrahim gambari is expected to return to burma this weekend for talks with the military government in the wake of the crackdown . "
i do think this sort of economic and political frustration that is within the population will manifest itself again in the coming months " mark canning , uk ambassador to burma army ' recruiting children ' monks unbowed a western diplomat told agence france-presse news agency mr gambari would be in burma from 3-8 november .
mr gambari last visited on 29 september , just three days after the bloody crackdown began , and met junta chief gen than shwe and aung san suu kyi .
he has been on a six-nation asian tour to try to increase pressure on the generals .
the british ambassador to burma , mark canning , told the bbc he expected further unrest in the country .
" i do think this sort of economic and political frustration that is within the population will manifest itself again in the coming months . "
meanwhile , in a move that will add further pressure to the ruling junta , the campaign group human rights watch has released a report saying children as young as 10 are beaten or threatened with arrest to make them enlist in the military .
the government insists it is opposed to the use of child soldiers , but human rights watch says the abuses have been extensive and systemic .

in the wake of the crackdown on protesters last month , public gatherings of monks in burma have been banned and many monasteries remain deserted .
according to the bbc 's asia correspondent andrew harding , there is no way of telling whether this new demonstration is the start of another wave of protests .
one monk who was on the march told the democratic voice of burma , a norway-based radio station run by dissident journalists : " we are continuing our protest from last month as we have not yet achieved any of the demands we asked for .
" our demands are for lower commodity prices , national reconciliation and immediate release of -lsb- pro-democracy leader -rsb- aung san suu kyi and all the political prisoners . "
aung nyo min , the thai-based director of the human rights education institute of burma , said of the rally : " this is very significant ... we are very encouraged to see the monks are taking up action and taking up peaceful demonstrations in burma . "
' systemic abuse ' there are hundreds of thousands of monks in burma .
they are highly revered and the clergy has historically been prominent in political protests .
the crackdown on protests sparked international action , with the united states and european union imposing sanctions and embargoes .
united nations envoy ibrahim gambari is expected to return to burma this weekend for talks with the military government in the wake of the crackdown .
i do think this sort of economic and political frustration that is within the population will manifest itself again in the coming months mark canning , uk ambassador to burma army ' recruiting children ' monks unbowed a western diplomat told agence france-presse news agency mr gambari would be in burma from 3-8 november .
mr gambari last visited on 29 september , just three days after the bloody crackdown began , and met junta chief gen than shwe and aung san suu kyi .
he has been on a six-nation asian tour to try to increase pressure on the generals .
the british ambassador to burma , mark canning , told the bbc he expected further unrest in the country .
" i do think this sort of economic and political frustration that is within the population will manifest itself again in the coming months . "
meanwhile , in a move that will add further pressure to the ruling junta , the campaign group human rights watch has released a report saying children as young as 10 are beaten or threatened with arrest to make them enlist in the military .
the government insists it is opposed to the use of child soldiers , but human rights watch says the abuses have been extensive and systemic .

prices rose 1.1 % in october from the previous month , taking the average house price to £ 186,044 , it said .
on an annual basis , house prices rose by 9.7 % from the same month in 2006 , up from september 's figure of 9 % .
however , the nationwide said that it would be " misguided " to view the rise as proof that house prices were immune to problems in the financial markets .
propped up the stock of unsold homes is still relatively low , and this is providing some residual support to prices fionnuala earley , nationwide chief economist house prices in the three months to october rose by 1.9 % compared with the previous three months , up from september 's figure of 1.7 % .
the three-month on three-month figure is often seen as a more accurate gauge of underlying price movements .
according to the nationwide , house prices are currently being supported by a number of factors , including the low level of properties coming onto the market .
" different factors could be driving the low level of instructions , including a reluctance to trade up amid current uncertainties and the fact that low unemployment is limiting the number of forced sales , " said nationwide chief economist fionnuala earley .
" the overall result is that the stock of unsold homes is still relatively low , and this is providing some residual support to prices , " she added .
other commentators viewed the nationwide 's figures with surprise .
" -lsb- it -rsb- seems at odds with the growing evidence of weaker buyer confidence , slowing mortgage demand and easing house price pressures shown by most other housing market indicators , " said research firm capital economics .
" as such , we would be wary of interpreting today 's data as evidence that the housing market remains robust , " it added .
but simon rubinsohn , chief economist of the royal institution of chartered surveyors , said the nationwide 's survey should be taken seriously .
" the endless talk of the demise of the property market is , at the very least , a little premature , " he said .
" the 1.1 % gain in prices in october represents the highest month-on-month increase this year and provides a stark contrast to the fears of outright price declines . "
slow down ?
recently other indicators have appeared to point to a slowing housing market , including a fall in mortgage approvals reported by the bank of england and a drop in buyer inquiries as seen by estate agents .
last week , the land registry for england and wales reported that annual property price inflation had slowed in september to 8.7 % from 9.4 % in august , describing this as a " noticeable dip " .
other recent surveys from big mortgage lenders , the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- and the department of communities and local government , have all been pointing in the same direction .
however , while there is evidence of a slowing in house price growth in many areas of the uk , it does not necessarily mean that the market will fall , the nationwide said .
referring to a report by the international monetary fund which claimed that uk house prices were overvalued , ms earley said it was " indisputable " that property values had climbed ahead of certain key indicators , particularly earnings .
but that did not mean that house prices were " destined to fall " , she added .
" in fact , in the absence of an early 1990s-style shock to unemployment or interest rates , they are unlikely to do so , " she explained .

propped up the stock of unsold homes is still relatively low , and this is providing some residual support to prices fionnuala earley , nationwide chief economist house prices in the three months to october rose by 1.9 % compared with the previous three months , up from september 's figure of 1.7 % .
the three-month on three-month figure is often seen as a more accurate gauge of underlying price movements .
according to the nationwide , house prices are currently being supported by a number of factors , including the low level of properties coming onto the market .
" different factors could be driving the low level of instructions , including a reluctance to trade up amid current uncertainties and the fact that low unemployment is limiting the number of forced sales , " said nationwide chief economist fionnuala earley .
" the overall result is that the stock of unsold homes is still relatively low , and this is providing some residual support to prices , " she added .
other commentators viewed the nationwide 's figures with surprise .
" -lsb- it -rsb- seems at odds with the growing evidence of weaker buyer confidence , slowing mortgage demand and easing house price pressures shown by most other housing market indicators , " said research firm capital economics .
" as such , we would be wary of interpreting today 's data as evidence that the housing market remains robust , " it added .
but simon rubinsohn , chief economist of the royal institution of chartered surveyors , said the nationwide 's survey should be taken seriously .
" the endless talk of the demise of the property market is , at the very least , a little premature , " he said .
" the 1.1 % gain in prices in october represents the highest month-on-month increase this year and provides a stark contrast to the fears of outright price declines . "
slow down ?
recently other indicators have appeared to point to a slowing housing market , including a fall in mortgage approvals reported by the bank of england and a drop in buyer inquiries as seen by estate agents .
last week , the land registry for england and wales reported that annual property price inflation had slowed in september to 8.7 % from 9.4 % in august , describing this as a " noticeable dip " .
other recent surveys from big mortgage lenders , the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- and the department of communities and local government , have all been pointing in the same direction .
however , while there is evidence of a slowing in house price growth in many areas of the uk , it does not necessarily mean that the market will fall , the nationwide said .
referring to a report by the international monetary fund which claimed that uk house prices were overvalued , ms earley said it was " indisputable " that property values had climbed ahead of certain key indicators , particularly earnings .
but that did not mean that house prices were " destined to fall " , she added .
" in fact , in the absence of an early 1990s-style shock to unemployment or interest rates , they are unlikely to do so , " she explained .

the data from the nhs information centre is for the year 2005-6 - the second year of the new gp contract .
it comes after pay rose by 20 % in the first year and means gps have seen pay rise by about £ 30,000 in two years .
the deal also allowed gps to opt out of weekend and evening care , which critics say has suffered after private firms and groups of medics were taken on .
but dr laurence buckman , chairman of the british medical association 's gps committee , defended the rises and said family doctors deserved to be paid well .
we are taking action to tie gp income more closely to patient experiences ben bradshaw , health minister q & a : gp pay he said : " the job is enjoyable because of our dealing with patients .
no business is worth what we do .
" most of the increase in gp pay in recent years has come from the extra resources that gps earn if they offer higher quality patient care .
" the outcome from this raised quality is a better standard of health for our patients . "
nonetheless , the combination of pay rises and out-of-hours care has meant both the government - for agreeing the deal - and doctors - for making the most of it - have come under heavy attack in recent years .
the pay rises have been fingered for contributing to the deficits with which the health service has been struggling .
complaints and many patients have said they are unhappy with the new out-of-hours arrangements with the number of complaints soaring as a result .
the gp contract overhauled the way doctors were paid .
about two thirds of their pay is effectively made up by a basic salary with the rest being paid dependent on performance in carrying out a range of services such as vaccinations and blood pressure monitoring .
health minister ben bradshaw maintained care had improved and said it was right gps were rewarded for that .
there is a feeling that compared with hospital doctors , gps have too big a share of the financial pie roger goss , of patient concern but he also said he wanted to see doctors adopt more flexible opening hours - in the past few months the government has been telling gps it wants to see more evening and weekend clinics .
" we will be working with gps to ensure that at least 50 % of practices extend their opening hours and we are taking action to tie gp income more closely to patient experiences . "
roger goss , of patient concern , said : " as a result of the contract we have shorter opening hours and a poorer out-of-hours service .
" quality of care is more important to patients than pay , but there is a feeling that compared with hospital doctors , gps have too big a share of the financial pie . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said it was right gps were well paid , but added they should be given more responsibility for controlling local budgets - currently the responsibility of primary care trusts .
" they are being treated , by this government , like well-paid production line employees . "
lib dem health spokesman norman lamb said : " gps should be well paid , but as a consequence patients must be able to get a high standard of out-of-hours care , which is currently dangerously patchy . "
the figures , which cover gp partners who run the practices rather than those employed on a salary , also show disparity when broken down by country .
gps in england earned an average of £ 113,600 , compared to £ 102,200 in wales , £ 98,700 in northern ireland and £ 90,600 in scotland .
doctors said this was linked to patient list sizes .
at the top end of the pay , over 1,000 gps were earning over £ 200,000 .
these are likely to be doctors who run a pharmacy as well as surgery .
many predict gp pay will not rise greatly in the next two years after the basic pay was frozen in 2006-7 and 2007-8 .
however , it is still possible the performance-related element may cause an increase .

the data from the nhs information centre is for the year 2005-6 - the second year of the new gp contract .
it comes after pay rose by 20 % in the first year and means gps have seen pay rise by about £ 30,000 in two years .
the deal also allowed gps to opt out of weekend and evening care , which critics say has suffered after private firms and groups of medics were taken on .

the pay rises have been fingered for contributing to the deficits with which the health service has been struggling .

amy pickard , from east sussex , is one of 300 people worldwide being treated with zolpidem , an insomnia drug .
in 2006 , researchers found that some patients in a vegetative state could be temporarily revived by taking it .
" within 20 to 25 minutes -lsb- of taking the first pill -rsb- you could see the change in her face , " said her mother , thelma .
ms pickard , 23 , experimented with heroin in 2001 and had to be resuscitated twice .
her mother , from sedlescombe , east sussex , said she was not an addict , but she just " got in with the wrong people " through her boyfriend at the time .
ms pickard was still a teenager when she collapsed in public toilets in hastings , and she was also seven months pregnant .
she 's much more aware and she will actually look around thelma pickard pill ' reverses ' vegetative state " we do n't know exactly what happened , but she had 15 minutes of getting no oxygen to her brain and she suffered brain damage , " her mother said .
" unfortunately we also lost the baby . "
a person in ms pickard 's condition may appear to be awake and have their eyes open , but will show no awareness of their surroundings .
thelma pickard embarked on the zolpidem trial after a visit to south africa , which was filmed for a documentary called the waking pill being broadcast on bbc one on wednesday .
she went with the programme makers to hear about south african patients given the pill who had then woken up " as if a switch had been flicked " .
she said : " i 'd actually heard about the pill about two years ago , but thought it was n't within my grasp , and then it came to find me . "
' profound brain injury ' her daughter is being cared for at the raphael medical centre , in hildenborough , kent , which specialises in a holistic approach to rehabilitation .
and mrs pickard said the drug seemed to be having an impact on helping her come out of a state of limbo .
" it 's all very , very exciting and my visits to amy are far more exciting now , " mrs pickard said .
" she is making fantastic steady progress ... she moves so much better now .
" the main thing that you see straight away is with her eyes , she 's much more aware and she will actually look around .
" she has a very profound brain injury ... but amy 's team feel she 's gaining from this pill so we 're keeping her on it for as long as -lsb- possible -rsb- . "
south african researchers writing in the neurorehabilitation journal in 2006 said three patients treated with zolpidem had been temporarily revived from a permanent vegetative state .
mrs pickard and the bbc documentary team also travelled to the country with the parents of joanne douglas , from prestwick , ayrshire , scotland , who has been unable to communicate since lapsing into a coma in 1995 .

thelma pickard embarked on the zolpidem trial after a visit to south africa , which was filmed for a documentary called the waking pill being broadcast on bbc one on wednesday .
she went with the programme makers to hear about south african patients given the pill who had then woken up " as if a switch had been flicked " .

and mrs pickard said the drug seemed to be having an impact on helping her come out of a state of limbo .
" it 's all very , very exciting and my visits to amy are far more exciting now , " mrs pickard said .
" she is making fantastic steady progress ... she moves so much better now .
" the main thing that you see straight away is with her eyes , she 's much more aware and she will actually look around .
" she has a very profound brain injury ... but amy 's team feel she 's gaining from this pill so we 're keeping her on it for as long as -lsb- possible -rsb- . "
south african researchers writing in the neurorehabilitation journal in 2006 said three patients treated with zolpidem had been temporarily revived from a permanent vegetative state .
mrs pickard and the bbc documentary team also travelled to the country with the parents of joanne douglas , from prestwick , ayrshire , scotland , who has been unable to communicate since lapsing into a coma in 1995 .
