program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .

most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .

the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .

" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .

german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .

german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voters have opted for another majority than the one that has governed the country over the last eight years . " after stirring past tensions with french-speakers in wallonia , leterme was quick to raise the sensitive issue of devolving more powers to the regions , which wallons fear could be a prelude to breaking up the country . " belgium is a country built on a historic compromise between two big -lrb- language -rrb- communities and that has to be respected , the country and its institutions need to function , " he said shortly after his party 's election victory .
leterme stoked controversy flanders parties are demanding wider political powers , and notably want to manage their own employment policy , which is currently in the hands of the federal government . they are trying to capitalize on the widespread belief in flanders , where unemployment is low , that flemish taxpayers foot the bill for unemployment benefits in wallonia , where joblessness is a huge problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's current prime minister guy verhofstadt had hoped to cling to power although leterme is perfectly bilingual thanks to a francophone father and flemish mother , he has made little effort to bridge the linguistic divide that cuts through belgian politics and life . in addition to disparaging wallons for their failure to learn dutch , he has stoked controversy in the past in wallonia by saying that belgium was an " accident of history " and that the country has no " intrinsic value . "
age-old conflict french-dutch tensions are running particularly high after the french-language state television channel aired a spoof ' breaking news ' story in december saying flanders had voted to break away . the program , which even included images of trams in brussels held up at the " new border " with flanders , was so realistic that the station was flooded with calls from disturbed viewers and sparked a media and political storm . as always in belgian politics , language will play a key role as the parties sit down to form a new coalition government .
a linguistic balance is essential . negotiations are due to start on monday but a government deal is likely to take at least one month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .

in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .

greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voters have opted for another majority than the one that has governed the country over the last eight years . " after stirring past tensions with french-speakers in wallonia , leterme was quick to raise the sensitive issue of devolving more powers to the regions , which wallons fear could be a prelude to breaking up the country . " belgium is a country built on a historic compromise between two big -lrb- language -rrb- communities and that has to be respected , the country and its institutions need to function , " he said shortly after his party 's election victory .
leterme stoked controversy flanders parties are demanding wider political powers , and notably want to manage their own employment policy , which is currently in the hands of the federal government . they are trying to capitalize on the widespread belief in flanders , where unemployment is low , that flemish taxpayers foot the bill for unemployment benefits in wallonia , where joblessness is a huge problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's current prime minister guy verhofstadt had hoped to cling to power although leterme is perfectly bilingual thanks to a francophone father and flemish mother , he has made little effort to bridge the linguistic divide that cuts through belgian politics and life . in addition to disparaging wallons for their failure to learn dutch , he has stoked controversy in the past in wallonia by saying that belgium was an " accident of history " and that the country has no " intrinsic value . "
age-old conflict french-dutch tensions are running particularly high after the french-language state television channel aired a spoof ' breaking news ' story in december saying flanders had voted to break away . the program , which even included images of trams in brussels held up at the " new border " with flanders , was so realistic that the station was flooded with calls from disturbed viewers and sparked a media and political storm . as always in belgian politics , language will play a key role as the parties sit down to form a new coalition government .
a linguistic balance is essential . negotiations are due to start on monday but a government deal is likely to take at least one month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "

age-old conflict french-dutch tensions are running particularly high after the french-language state television channel aired a spoof ' breaking news ' story in december saying flanders had voted to break away . the program , which even included images of trams in brussels held up at the " new border " with flanders , was so realistic that the station was flooded with calls from disturbed viewers and sparked a media and political storm . as always in belgian politics , language will play a key role as the parties sit down to form a new coalition government .
a linguistic balance is essential . negotiations are due to start on monday but a government deal is likely to take at least one month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "

considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .

the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voters have opted for another majority than the one that has governed the country over the last eight years .

deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 11.06.2007 acclaimed german violin-maker tops italian masters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin-maker stefan-peter greiner needs two years to craft an instrument stefan-peter greiner creates violins for some of the best musicians in the world .
deutsche welle visited the violin-maker at his atelier in bonn to learn how he makes a block of wood sing . in the mid-nineteenth century , germany was a center of affordable violins .
today , however , many string instruments are mass produced in china .
while the majority of german violin-makers make a living from doing repairs , very few spend their time exclusively producing top-notch violins .
one of these exceptions is stefan-peter greiner in bonn .
his violins are played by internationally renowned musicians and are considered to be on a par with italian masters like stradivari or guarneri .
in order to continually improve his product and even surpass the creations of the 17th and 18th century innovators , greiner studies the sound of old instruments together with other researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner models his violins after those created by antonio stradivari in the 17th century " the problem with setting the sound is that you ca n't hear well or objectively for a half hour afterwards , " greiner told deutsche welle from his atelier in bonn .
" you have to do it in several stages , ideally twice a day for 15 minutes each .
it can take weeks . "
time-intensive procedure all in all , greiner needs two years to turn a block of wood into a finished violin .
his procedure is very similar to that of the italian masters over 300 years ago .
first he selects a piece of wood , which he then stores for up to 15 years before carving out the pieces of the instrument as well as the bow .
once assembled , the unvarnished body of the violin is hung in the sun for over a year - to get a tan .
indeed , the wood takes on a darker color from its sunbath .
when the instrument is finally varnished , it may appear finished , but the most important step is yet to come : stringing it and making it " sing . "
after all , greiner wants his violins to sound at least as good as a famous stradivarius or guarnerius .
while the originals can cost as much as six million euros -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- , a greiner violin goes for around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- .
not only are his customers willing to fork out the hefty sum , they 're also prepared to wait up to eight years to get their hands on one .
not just anyone can buy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greiner wo n't let just anyone play his violins " i choose my customers , " said greiner .
" it 's a really important criterion for me that the violinist is able to strongly identify with this violin .
first and foremost , i look at how good the violinist is , whether they 'll do justice to my violin and whether they 'll be good for advertising . "
in the end , only one in two interested customers makes the cut and wins a spot on greiner 's coveted waiting list .
" there 's no one - no one in the world , i think - who has such prominent musicians among their customers , who actually play the instruments , " added greiner .
" i have violinists like christian tetzlaff and isabelle van keulen . "
no need to expand the violin-maker 's wood-scented workshop is small and 30 or so unfinished instruments hang from hooks on the ceiling .
the shelves are full of tools , chemicals and a large selection of classical cds .
greiner works on five or six instruments at a time , completing up to 15 a year .
considering the large demand for his products , he could raise his prices and expand his workshop .
but higher prices mean fewer customers , and greiner enjoys the luxury of being selective .
he 's also not interested in producing more violins .
" first of all , i do n't have the space right now , " he said .
" it 's also really difficult to train someone to do exactly what i want .
you have to have a personal relationship with an assistant and know that they 're going to be around for years ; i 've just started with one trainee . " jutta wasserrab -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .

lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .

both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2007 eu mulls ways to entice illegal immigrants to leave by choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants a unified policy for expelling illegal immigrants european union countries expel roughly 200,000 people each year .
illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .

voters have opted for another majority than the one that has governed the country over the last eight years .

the remaining money in the fund will be used for reconciliation projects . the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation to compensate nazi-era forced laborers paid 1.7 million people more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- in recent years .
" the money has been paid and everything has run its course without a problem , " otto graf lambsdorff , a german politician and the fund 's vice chair , said in a radio interview on monday .
both german chancellor angela merkel and president horst köhler are expected to make official announcements about the successful end of the payments on tuesday .
the fund was conceived as a way to compensate victims of nazi-era forced labor policies .
the money is intended for those who were sent to nazi concentration camps such as auschwitz in which they were forced to work in rough conditions and take part in sadistic medical experiments .
six decades later , many of those who survived the camps still bare the physical and emotional scars .
money from the fund also went towards victims and their descendants who currently live in europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war .
german companies contributed money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women line up for hard labor at auschwitz the german government created the fund in 2000 after years of debate .
the money came equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war .
the money was a tax deductible donation , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war .
many companies had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor .
german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros -lrb- $ 10,300 -rrb- .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fund compensated 1.7 million people forced to work for the nazis the fund " made an imporant advancement in reconciliation between germans and the many victims of national socialism , " green party head volker beck said .
beck voiced his opposition to the decision to shrink the size of the foundation and worried about a dominance on the board by german businessmen .
lambsdorff , a member of the free democratic party , said it was necessary to restructure the organization .
" a large organization , which was needed in order to pay out so much money to the forced laborers , will not be needed anymore in the future , " lambsdorff said .
the fund will spend its remaining endowment on reconciliation projects totalling 7 million euros annually . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are encouraged to return home voluntarily , but advocacy groups worry there is often little free will involved . all told , anywhere from two to eight million people live in the eu illegally : they come to study and then never leave , have their asylum applications rejected , overstay tourist visas or work in eu countries .
the eu wants to harmonize how member states go about removing people from the bloc .
the european return fund , set to start in 2008 , will provide 676 million euros -lrb- $ 907 million -rrb- to help countries share the burden of returning illegal immigrants to their home countries . a common directive to guide the fund is still needed , but the european commission is hopeful it will be in place by the end of the year . voluntary returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some refugees want to go home , but ca n't for humanitarian and practical reasons , the eu would rather have people leave the bloc voluntarily .
forcing an illegal person to leave is a last resort , a spokesman for the european commission said .
brice hortefeux , the head of france 's new ministry of immigration and national identity , recently suggested encouraging people to return home voluntarily by offering an immigrant family of four 6,000 euros .
" we must increase this measure to help voluntary returns , " said hortefeux , an ally of french president nicolas sarkozy .
" i am very clearly committed to doing that . "
france and most other european countries have programs to assist immigrants in returning home .
in most cases , the help for illegal migrants is far less generous than thousands of euros .
typically , it means a one-way plane ticket and a few hundred euros for reintegration into their home country .
pull factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers want to come to europe there has been concern that a generous european policy for expelling people will be a " pull factor " in encouraging further illegal immigration . but patricia coelho , who works on the issue of returns for european council on refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , said people pay large amounts of money to smugglers and risk their lives to reach europe .
she added that they are n't doing this with the hope that they 'll get a few hundred euros to return home .
" it 's just quite ludicrous , " she said .
" we really do n't buy this pull factor argument . "
ecre has welcomed the eu 's efforts to harmonize its policies as " a starting point to get countries to agree on basic standards and safeguards . "
but the eu still needs to define basic terms , such as what is meant by " voluntary , " coelho said . are they really volunteering ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates want to ensure humane treatment of illegal immigrants approximately 70 percent of illegal immigrants are forced to return and 30 percent return home voluntarily , according to eu figures .
but this means very different things depending on the eu country .
for ecre , a voluntary return must include the choice to return home or to stay in europe .
most illegal immigrants who return home do n't have that choice .
they are picked up by immigration authorities and told they can either " voluntarily " leave or be expelled against their will .
the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has run voluntary return programs in europe for more than 20 years .
iom programs help returnees not only with money , but also job counseling , language tutoring and other assistance .
iom helped 28,000 people return home in 2006 .
while in the past many of the people they assisted were asylum seekers , an increasing number are irregular migrants , said nicoletta giordano , who heads the iom 's assisted voluntary returns program . " the majority of migrants who come to europe will leave on their own , " giordano said .
" we 're trying to ensure that people go back in dignity and that their return is not seen as such a failure . " a " hidden form of expulsion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants often have few choices voluntary return , as it is used by many eu countries , is often a " hidden form of expulsion , " said jean-pierre cassarino cassarino , the scientific coordinator of the mirem project .
the project supports the reintegration of migrants from algeria , morocco and tunisia and is hosted at the robert schuman center for advanced studies in florence , italy .
migrants who left the eu voluntarily were much more likely to be content with their decision , a mirem study released last week shows .
of migrants who were forced to return home , 52 percent said they would " absolutely " or " maybe " try to leave again for abroad , according to the mirem survey . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu mingkang , the head of china 's banking regulatory commission -lrb- cbrc -rrb- says globalisation has become a " double-edged sword " for china .
mr liu , who has played a key role in liberalising china 's financial sector , was outlining the challenges of globalisation at a seminar at oxford university 's global economic governance programme .
he says that while globalisation is now an inescapable reality , it presents difficulties as well as opportunities for china 's economy .
opening out there is no doubt that china has become much richer as a result of opening up to the west since 1978 .
shanghai shoppers want western affluence its economy has grown on average by 9.7 % per year , while per capita income in urban areas has grown by 6.7 % per year , and trade by a robust 12 % per year .
the number of people living on less than $ 1 -lrb- 50 pence -rrb- per day has dropped dramatically .
in the financial sector , mr liu has presided over a series of dramatic changes since the chinese banking sector faced near-meltdown in 2002 .
he has allowed western banks to take shares in china 's main commercial banks , allowed them to set up branches in mainland china , and in april agreed that they could compete directly with chinese banks for retail customers .
fundamentally unbalanced now he seems ready to allow private equity funds to operate in china to improve the efficient working of the capital markets .
but mr liu says that that chinas ' dramatic growth has become fundamentally unbalanced , with personal consumption making up less than 50 % of chinese output -lrb- the rest comes from exports and investment -rrb- .
the export drive has created a very large trade surplus , with the chinese central bank now holding more than $ 1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves .
this , he says , has created excess liquidity - too much cash - in the economy , which he accepts has helped to fuel a property boom and now a stock market boom .
the spare cash has also led firms to over-invest , so that in many basic industries such as steel and cement there is vast over-capacity .
the answer , in his view , is to boost domestic consumption , but to do that the government has to overcome some deep-seated fears among the population .
he also wants the banks to be tougher in giving out loans to companies , which still raise most of their investment cash from the banking sector .
the chinese government shares this view and is also concerned about the growing imbalances between rich and poor , and between the coastal cities and the rural interior of the country .
however , so far attempts by the government to slow the investment boom have had only limited success .
too many savers mr liu is also concerned that chinese citizens are saving too much and spending too little .
liu mingkang wants to liberalise china 's financial markets he argues that the underlying reason for this is the removal of the social safety net that used to exist when china 's state-owned firms provided jobs-for-life , pensions , health care and housing for their workers .
now , according to mr liu , the chinese government spends much less on health and education -lrb- as a percentage of gdp -rrb- than other countries at a similar level of development , such as india and the philippines .
he argues that the government needs to increase its spending on social security in order to give people the confidence that the state will still be able to meet many of their future needs and therefore free them to spend more in the present .
he believes that liberalising the financial system , improving the retail banking sector and making it easier to get personal loans and credit cards , could help to spread prosperity .
talent search but for china 's top regulator , the biggest challenge is to find the talented individuals who will be the next generation of experts and reformers .
mr liu says that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit highly educated and dedicated people to work in the public sector , as the lure and glamour of the private sector has increased in china .
this is a problem faced by many developing countries .
mr liu 's generation of technocrats was one of the first to be educated in the west and to be exposed to western business practices .
mr liu , who was head of the bank of china , the country 's second largest bank , worked for three years in london .
but the next generation , including the dozens of oxford university students from china who turned up to hear mr liu , the temptation to stay in the west might prove irresistible .
this is one of a series of articles on how globalisation is transforming china .
future articles will look at the problems of pollution and migrant labour .

too many savers mr liu is also concerned that chinese citizens are saving too much and spending too little .
liu mingkang wants to liberalise china 's financial markets he argues that the underlying reason for this is the removal of the social safety net that used to exist when china 's state-owned firms provided jobs-for-life , pensions , health care and housing for their workers .
now , according to mr liu , the chinese government spends much less on health and education -lrb- as a percentage of gdp -rrb- than other countries at a similar level of development , such as india and the philippines .
he argues that the government needs to increase its spending on social security in order to give people the confidence that the state will still be able to meet many of their future needs and therefore free them to spend more in the present .
he believes that liberalising the financial system , improving the retail banking sector and making it easier to get personal loans and credit cards , could help to spread prosperity .
talent search but for china 's top regulator , the biggest challenge is to find the talented individuals who will be the next generation of experts and reformers .
mr liu says that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit highly educated and dedicated people to work in the public sector , as the lure and glamour of the private sector has increased in china .
this is a problem faced by many developing countries .
mr liu 's generation of technocrats was one of the first to be educated in the west and to be exposed to western business practices .
mr liu , who was head of the bank of china , the country 's second largest bank , worked for three years in london .

liu mingkang , the head of china 's banking regulatory commission -lrb- cbrc -rrb- says globalisation has become a " double-edged sword " for china .
mr liu , who has played a key role in liberalising china 's financial sector , was outlining the challenges of globalisation at a seminar at oxford university 's global economic governance programme .
he says that while globalisation is now an inescapable reality , it presents difficulties as well as opportunities for china 's economy .
opening out there is no doubt that china has become much richer as a result of opening up to the west since 1978 .
shanghai shoppers want western affluence its economy has grown on average by 9.7 % per year , while per capita income in urban areas has grown by 6.7 % per year , and trade by a robust 12 % per year .
the number of people living on less than $ 1 -lrb- 50 pence -rrb- per day has dropped dramatically .
in the financial sector , mr liu has presided over a series of dramatic changes since the chinese banking sector faced near-meltdown in 2002 .
he has allowed western banks to take shares in china 's main commercial banks , allowed them to set up branches in mainland china , and in april agreed that they could compete directly with chinese banks for retail customers .
fundamentally unbalanced now he seems ready to allow private equity funds to operate in china to improve the efficient working of the capital markets .
but mr liu says that that chinas ' dramatic growth has become fundamentally unbalanced , with personal consumption making up less than 50 % of chinese output -lrb- the rest comes from exports and investment -rrb- .
the export drive has created a very large trade surplus , with the chinese central bank now holding more than $ 1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves .
this , he says , has created excess liquidity - too much cash - in the economy , which he accepts has helped to fuel a property boom and now a stock market boom .
the spare cash has also led firms to over-invest , so that in many basic industries such as steel and cement there is vast over-capacity .
the answer , in his view , is to boost domestic consumption , but to do that the government has to overcome some deep-seated fears among the population .
he also wants the banks to be tougher in giving out loans to companies , which still raise most of their investment cash from the banking sector .
the chinese government shares this view and is also concerned about the growing imbalances between rich and poor , and between the coastal cities and the rural interior of the country .

the award-winning series , which has run for eight years on cable channel hbo , centres on the life of a dysfunctional mob family in new jersey .
millions had been expected to watch to learn the fate of the top mobster and main character , tony soprano .
as the series came to an end after eight years and 86 episodes , the question was : " what happens to tony ? "
irony and satire it has been described as the richest achievement in the history of tv , likened both to a shakespearean drama and a greek tragedy - the tale of tony soprano and the mafia crime family he controls . "
tony soprano has got a depth to him that we 've rarely seen in mobsters " paul chitlik hollywood screenwriter hollywood screenwriter paul chitlik says the character is a person audiences love to hate .
" inside ourselves we know we should not be liking this person - he is a killer .
" on the other hand , he has got a depth to him that we 've rarely seen in mobsters so we want to see what 's going to happen to him , just like we want to see what 's going to happen to our uncle ralph . "
with its complex characters , social satire and rich irony , the sopranos was always about more than the mob .
by portraying tony and his associates as everyday citizens , many believe it held a mirror to modern society .
the sopranos has been both a cultural and a ratings sensation - essential viewing for millions of fans on both sides of the atlantic .
for many here , sunday nights will never be quite the same .
did you watch the finale ?
what will you do without tony soprano ?
was it the best ever series ?
what was so special about the sopranos ?

it certainly was not a fitting end to 8 years of compelling viewing .
phil phil morel , redmond , usa i saw the last ever episode with friends in an italian restaurant - all very pleasant .
i thought the build up to the last moments of the show was very well done - we were all on the edge of our seats at the time .

it was not all tied up in a bow and neatly put away .
it was a fitting end to the series which was never about resolution , but a story of the evil that exists in these character 's lives .
it is frankly more amazing that the main criticism of the last episode is its lack of resolution .
this was n't seinfeld folks .

clever writing but an unusual ending to say the least .

this was a great series .

iraq is a poor advertisement for intervention by the international community .
the level of violence there has been horrendous since the fall of saddam hussein and daily life remains enormously difficult for most citizens .
for the most part , the presence of foreign troops and administrators is widely resented .
the tragedy is that the americans and their allies had a huge wealth of experience from other countries on which to draw and enjoyed wide popularity among iraqis at the start of the occupation .
but they ignored every past lesson , lost the golden hour after the fall of saddam 's statue and with it the support of the people they were trying to help .
a place for the un i am convinced that , despite the disaster of iraq , the international community has an increasingly important role in the world 's hotspots .
in an ever more interdependent world , bodies like the united nations and the european union are inevitably being drawn into helping to resolve conflicts and rebuild shattered nations .
and despite the high-profile failures , we do know how to do this .
we have succeeded in post-conflict reconstruction more often than we have failed and the world is a safer place because of it .
one estimate is that intervention by the un has halved the number of wars and more than halved the number of casualties in conflicts round the world since the end of the cold war .
post-war germany 's experience the allied occupation of germany after world war two , particularly in the british zone , contained a great many lessons for the future .
paddy ashdown leader of uk liberal democrat party 1988-1999 knighted in 2000 , became baron ashdown of norton-sub-hamdon in 2001 named high representative for bosnia and herzegovina in 2002 ; left in 2006 named chair of northern ireland parades review body in may 2007 the first instinct was to punish the germans .
british troops were forbidden even to speak to civilians .
huge swathes of german industry were dismantled .
and the authorities embarked on a vast programme of de-nazification , removing tens of thousands from their jobs .
germans were heard saying that they looked forward to the fifth reich , because the fourth was as bad as the third .
the policy was disastrous , and germany was only saved because of the russian threat .
the allies soon came to realise that they needed germany as a partner against the ussr .
de-nazification was abandoned .
the allies reversed their policy of dismantling german factories and replaced it with the marshall plan and a strenuous programme to encourage german economic growth .
by 1949 , germany was on the way to its economic miracle .
the lesson was clear .
you can not run a country if you remove most of the people with administrative experience .
you must do everything in your power , by harnessing the efforts of the local population , to restore basic services like water and electricity , so that people can see that their lives are being improved .
none of this was done in iraq .
disbanded and disgruntled the iraq war has been described as a catastrophic success .
victory was won so quickly that very little thought and almost no planning was devoted to managing the peace .
officials at the us state department had done some preparation , but a matter of months before the war started they were cut out of the loop and reconstruction was entrusted to the defence department .
so those on the ground lacked any experience of the tasks before them .
they in turn were micromanaged from washington by officials who knew even less .
de-baathification in iraq mirrored the early errors of de-nazification in germany .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan told me , it was a colossal mistake , a judgment echoed by the first american administrator in iraq , gen jay garner , and many others .
the whole iraqi army was disbanded .
the result was a double whammy .
not only was there a dangerous security vacuum , rapidly filled by the looters and the insurgents , but there were also large numbers of unemployed ex-army officers , smarting from the loss of prestige and income , all too happy to join the opponents of the new order .
without a plan after a conflict like the iraq war , the priorities should be first security , second restoring services and third getting the economy going as fast as possible .
all require planning and substantial resources , often a great deal more than needed for the war itself .
carl bildt 's lessons for state-builders yet time and time again , the international community has found itself effectively running a country with no plans in place .
when my predecessor carl bildt , the first high representative in bosnia , arrived there after the conflict , all he had was an envelope full of money .
he had no office , no transport , no telephone and no blueprint for carrying out his task .
consultation there was another fundamental mistake in iraq .
for far too long , the us had failed to bring in neighbouring states like syria and iran , which had an enormous stake in the stability of the region .
yet 12 years earlier , the un had been successful in stabilising el salvador after an exceptionally bloody civil war , in large part by involving neighbouring states which were desperate that the conflict did not spill over its borders onto their soil .
again the lessons were there but completely ignored .
kofi annan pointed out to me the inconsistency in the american view that , while the us itself can have a legitimate national interest in iraq , a neighbouring state like iran can not .
so the conclusion from iraq is not that the international community should never intervene again .
it is rather that future interveners should study history and prepare carefully .
history teaches us these lessons for the interveners : leave your prejudices at home , keep your ambitions low , have enough resources to do the job , do not lose the golden hour , make security your first priority , involve the neighbours .
and remember that post-conflict reconstruction is not for the faint-hearted .
it requires toughness , strategic patience and a willingness to stay until the task is finished .
you can hear the first part of lord ashdown 's radio series winning the peace at 0805 gmt on 11 june on bbc world service .
his book swords and ploughshares , about conflict resolution , was published recently .

you can not run a country if you remove most of the people with administrative experience .
you must do everything in your power , by harnessing the efforts of the local population , to restore basic services like water and electricity , so that people can see that their lives are being improved .

so the conclusion from iraq is not that the international community should never intervene again .

the us has alienated iraqis who initially welcomed the invasion iraq is a poor advertisement for intervention by the international community .
the level of violence there has been horrendous since the fall of saddam hussein and daily life remains enormously difficult for most citizens .
for the most part , the presence of foreign troops and administrators is widely resented .
the tragedy is that the americans and their allies had a huge wealth of experience from other countries on which to draw and enjoyed wide popularity among iraqis at the start of the occupation .

the us has alienated iraqis who initially welcomed the invasion iraq is a poor advertisement for intervention by the international community .
the level of violence there has been horrendous since the fall of saddam hussein and daily life remains enormously difficult for most citizens .
for the most part , the presence of foreign troops and administrators is widely resented .
the tragedy is that the americans and their allies had a huge wealth of experience from other countries on which to draw and enjoyed wide popularity among iraqis at the start of the occupation .
but they ignored every past lesson , lost the golden hour after the fall of saddam 's statue and with it the support of the people they were trying to help .
a place for the un i am convinced that , despite the disaster of iraq , the international community has an increasingly important role in the world 's hotspots .
in an ever more interdependent world , bodies like the united nations and the european union are inevitably being drawn into helping to resolve conflicts and rebuild shattered nations .
and despite the high-profile failures , we do know how to do this .
we have succeeded in post-conflict reconstruction more often than we have failed and the world is a safer place because of it .
one estimate is that intervention by the un has halved the number of wars and more than halved the number of casualties in conflicts round the world since the end of the cold war .
post-war germany 's experience the allied occupation of germany after world war two , particularly in the british zone , contained a great many lessons for the future .

a survey for national carers week showed many felt the role was affecting their relationships and they needed more help .
alice mitchell , 14 , from pontyberem in carmarthenshire , explains how she helps care for her mother debbie who has multiple sclerosis . "
my mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or ms in 1993 and i 've been helping to care for her since i was five .
i help mum every day , in the morning i get her clothes ready .
dad does it sometimes , but he picks some strange colours like brown and red .
when i come home from school , i help with the cooking and the washing .
because mum uses a wheelchair , she ca n't always reach things in cupboards or up high and she gets tired quite easily .
i have to help mum because if she tried to reach something and she fell out of her wheelchair , that would be a big disaster .
it 's really unfair that mum has been forced to use a wheelchair , she really does n't deserve it .
before she was ill , she used to love sport like netball , squash and swimming and she ca n't do those things now .
she 's the adult - and that means not having to rely on others , but now has to rely on me .
she says she feels as if she 's robbed me of my childhood .
she says she 'd love to be able to walk the fields of our farm with me , but she ca n't do that now .
when she thinks about the things she 'd like us to do together , it makes her cry .
i do n't always like caring .
i definitely have my off days , when i do n't want to do things for my mum .
sometimes i do n't want to empty the dishwasher or help to prepare food .
sometimes i just want to relax , but i still have to help - it can be a bit of a pain .
i go to a young carers group run by the charity barnardo 's .
it 's great because we do n't have to talk about how we look after the one we care for , we can just have a night off and have fun .
and that 's what we generally tend to do .
have fun .
i want people to know about young carers .
if we did n't exist , the government would have to pay out loads of money for real carers .
i think the government should put the money into free activities for us .
i 'd like people to realise what we 're doing .
i do feel proud about what i do .
when other kids at school talk about how they 're making an effort to help someone who lives next door or something , they 'll only do it for about a month maximum .
i do it full time .
i feel good about the fact that i 'm helping mum and also helping the government by preventing them sending out a real carer . "

a survey for national carers week showed many felt the role was affecting their relationships and they needed more help .
alice mitchell , 14 , from pontyberem in carmarthenshire , explains how she helps care for her mother debbie who has multiple sclerosis .
my mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or ms in 1993 and i 've been helping to care for her since i was five .
i help mum every day , in the morning i get her clothes ready .
dad does it sometimes , but he picks some strange colours like brown and red .
when i come home from school , i help with the cooking and the washing .
because mum uses a wheelchair , she ca n't always reach things in cupboards or up high and she gets tired quite easily .
i have to help mum because if she tried to reach something and she fell out of her wheelchair , that would be a big disaster .
it 's really unfair that mum has been forced to use a wheelchair , she really does n't deserve it .
alice mitchell has been helping her mother since she was five before she was ill , she used to love sport like netball , squash and swimming and she ca n't do those things now .
she 's the adult - and that means not having to rely on others , but now has to rely on me .
she says she feels as if she 's robbed me of my childhood .
she says she 'd love to be able to walk the fields of our farm with me , but she ca n't do that now .
when she thinks about the things she 'd like us to do together , it makes her cry .
i do n't always like caring .
i definitely have my off days , when i do n't want to do things for my mum .
sometimes i do n't want to empty the dishwasher or help to prepare food .
sometimes i just want to relax , but i still have to help - it can be a bit of a pain .
i go to a young carers group run by the charity barnardo 's .
it 's great because we do n't have to talk about how we look after the one we care for , we can just have a night off and have fun .
and that 's what we generally tend to do .
have fun .
i want people to know about young carers .
if we did n't exist , the government would have to pay out loads of money for real carers .
i think the government should put the money into free activities for us .
i 'd like people to realise what we 're doing .
i do feel proud about what i do .
when other kids at school talk about how they 're making an effort to help someone who lives next door or something , they 'll only do it for about a month maximum .
i do it full time .
i feel good about the fact that i 'm helping mum and also helping the government by preventing them sending out a real carer .

figures released under the freedom of information act showed that 1,291 cautions had been issued for sexual offences between 2001 and 2006 .
the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- , insisted a caution for rape was only used in " exceptional circumstances " .
but support group women against rape -lrb- war -rrb- said it was a " slap in the face " for a woman if a rapist was cautioned .
' lesser offence ' the information supplied by the metropolitan police -lrb- met -rrb- revealed 29 of the total cautions for rape involved children under the age of 16 .
a further 50 cautions were issued between 2001 and 2006 for sexual assaults on children aged under 13 .
and of these offences , those involving girls increased from 5 in 2004 to 12 in 2005 and 14 in 2006 .
a spokeswoman for the cps said that two points must be considered when looking at the figures for rape cautions .
" if an allegation of rape is made but they are cautioned for a lesser offence it is registered as a caution for rape , " she said .
caution facts an admission of guilt is needed for a caution .
admitting guilt means being put on the sex offenders register .
the caution will show up on a search of criminal records .
the cps decides how to handle rape cases .
the cps says cautions are only used in exceptional cases .
rape carries a maximum life sentence .
" also cautions are used in situations where there are exceptional circumstances such as if there are two very young people involved with learning difficulties . "
a met police spokesman said : " the issue of a caution is a home office approved method of dealing with an individual after a thorough investigation has been completed .
" a caution is only given after serious consideration has been given to a number of factors and account has been taken of the public interest principles set out in the code for crown prosecutors issued by the cps .
" a caution may only be given when the individual admits the offence .
every case must be judged on its merits .
" a caution may also be cited in court in any subsequent court proceedings and can be quoted on a standard or enhanced disclosure issued by the criminal records bureau and thus can be made known to a prospective employer . "
but rape support group war said getting justice was essential to recovery after being raped .
" it 's a slap in the face when the man is let off with merely a caution , a huge setback when you are trying to rebuild your life .
" cautions confirm that the authorities hardly count what happened to you as serious . "
the group said that cautions for rape were " the tip of the iceberg " as conviction rates had fallen to 5 % .

figures released under the freedom of information act showed that 1,291 cautions had been issued for sexual offences between 2001 and 2006 .
the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- , insisted a caution for rape was only used in " exceptional circumstances " .
but support group women against rape -lrb- war -rrb- said it was a " slap in the face " for a woman if a rapist was cautioned .
' lesser offence ' the information supplied by the metropolitan police -lrb- met -rrb- revealed 29 of the total cautions for rape involved children under the age of 16 .
a further 50 cautions were issued between 2001 and 2006 for sexual assaults on children aged under 13 .
and of these offences , those involving girls increased from 5 in 2004 to 12 in 2005 and 14 in 2006 .
a spokeswoman for the cps said that two points must be considered when looking at the figures for rape cautions .
" if an allegation of rape is made but they are cautioned for a lesser offence it is registered as a caution for rape , " she said .
caution facts an admission of guilt is needed for a caution .
admitting guilt means being put on the sex offenders register .
the caution will show up on a search of criminal records .
the cps decides how to handle rape cases .
the cps says cautions are only used in exceptional cases .
rape carries a maximum life sentence .
" also cautions are used in situations where there are exceptional circumstances such as if there are two very young people involved with learning difficulties . "
a met police spokesman said : " the issue of a caution is a home office approved method of dealing with an individual after a thorough investigation has been completed .
" a caution is only given after serious consideration has been given to a number of factors and account has been taken of the public interest principles set out in the code for crown prosecutors issued by the cps .
" a caution may only be given when the individual admits the offence .
every case must be judged on its merits .
" a caution may also be cited in court in any subsequent court proceedings and can be quoted on a standard or enhanced disclosure issued by the criminal records bureau and thus can be made known to a prospective employer . "
but rape support group war said getting justice was essential to recovery after being raped .
" it 's a slap in the face when the man is let off with merely a caution , a huge setback when you are trying to rebuild your life .
" cautions confirm that the authorities hardly count what happened to you as serious . "
the group said that cautions for rape were " the tip of the iceberg " as conviction rates had fallen to 5 % .

the decision to close the club was made by mr horton at the end of last month , who said he had lost thousands of pounds since buying the club last year and could no longer bankroll it .
the club had been attracting crowds of about 400 to 500 for its home meetings - a figure that would still need to double for it to break even .
peter toogood , chairman of the british speedway promoters ' association , said : " hopefully now oxford as a club can lay the foundations for a strong future .
