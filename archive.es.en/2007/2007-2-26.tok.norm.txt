program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.02.2007 in germany , men who burned anne frank 's diary face trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diary of anne frank is one of the best known books on the brutality of the nazi regime a german man admitted monday to publicly burning a copy of anne frank 's diary , at the start of a trial against seven suspected right-wing extremists . lars konrad said in a statement read by his attorney that he had tossed a copy of the holocaust victim 's diary onto a bonfire at a summer solstice party last june . but he said he was not making a statement about the nazis ' mass slaughter of 6 million european jews with his actions . another suspect admitted to throwing a us flag into the fire .
the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims . " nobody wants to be a witness " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany faces a particular challenge from right-wing extremists the court in magdeburg has invited eight witnesses to the trial , which is expected to draw much media attention around germany .
however media reports say the gathering of evidence and testimonies is not expected to be easy . though some 80 inhabitants of the 900-strong village of pretzien are said to have witnessed the book burning last june , few are expected to come forward and talk about it . " a huge silence hangs over the place , " andreas holtz , the local protestant priest told berlin-based daily die tageszeitung .
" people would rather stay silent than say something wrong .
nobody wants to be a witness . " " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .

" the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" the granting of regulatory holidays to incumbent operators is an attempt to stifle competition in a crucial sector of the economy , and in violation of the eu telecom rules in place since 2002 , " she added . telekom enjoying unfair advantage ? germany is building a fiber optic network that is supposed to cover 50 cities and expected to cost 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- . the network is already up and running in 10 cities but deutsche telekom asked the government to allow it to block access to rivals during the first years of operation to help recoup its investment costs . " in the commission 's view , the german law , as now adopted , jeopardizes the competitive position of deutsche telekom 's existing competitors and makes it much harder for new competitors to enter german markets , " the eu executive said in a statement . moreover , the commission said the law went against the wishes of the german internet authority , the bundesnetzagentur , which has also called on deutsche telekom to allow rivals to use the network . with no indication that berlin intends to back down , the commission could seek a injunction or a fast-track case before the european court of justice . along with poland , germany now faces the highest number of eu legal proceedings against it with six pending cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom enjoys a huge share of the national telephone market deutsche telekom , about 32 percent of which is owned by the german state , enjoys a broad share of the national telephone market , controlling access of 9,400,000 lines in germany out of a total of 12,900,000 lines . however , there is considerable scope for the former state monopoly to strengthen its hand in the internet access market with germany having a broadband penetration rate in germany at well below other leading eu countries . the commission estimates that only 16 percent of the german population has access to broadband internet access compared with nearly 30 percent in denmark and the netherlands . preventing germany from setting an example analyst theo kitz at german bank merck fink said deutsche telekom has run into relatively weak demand among customers for broadband access mainly because it is too expensive . " they have told us the customer take-up is slow , " he said .
" in my opinion , it 's because of pricing , they have to lower prices . " he predicted that the european commission would take a " hard line " in the case so as not to tempt other companies in other countries to try to seek regulatory holidays . " they 're very tough and very serious because they fear that if they open the door a little some other company will push it open , " he said .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture .

" un calls for ban in great britain , the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , switzerland and scandinavia , selling electro-shockers is forbidden .
this is , however , not the case in germany , which ranks second behind the united states in exporting the devices .
german exporters need only apply for a license to sell the torture devices abroad . " it is my wish that every country in the world would completely outlaw the export of all electro-shock weapons and punish violators with high monetary fines or prison sentences , " nowak said . boris bauer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 26.02.2007 statement by convicted terrorist casts doubt on pardon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's manifesto was too bring down the capitalist state through violence a german terrorist hoping for parole has released a written statement that has raised eyebrows .
its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

but will prodi be reinstated later this week ? after prodi submitted his resignation last wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano asked him and his left-center coalition to stand a vote of confidence in parliament .
the vote is expected to take place on thursday , but the government will decide monday on an exact appointment . in an effort to unify his coalition , which is split on a variety of issues including pension reform , italian troops in afghanistan and rights for homosexual couples , prodi presented a 12-point-pact to his coalition partners last thursday in an effort to bridge the divides . 12-point-plan does n't solve the problem the coalition 's biggest problem - that it " spans from communists to christian democrats " - ca n't be solved with its new 12-point program , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung on monday .
" to find a common denominator , it wo n't be enough to declare a new ' spirit ' and sign a blank check with the 12-point plan . " prodi does n't have a secure majority , continued the paper .
prodi is on thin ice , but " the real test will come in march with the impending afghanistan vote and retirement reform . " down to the wire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former pm silvio berlusconi ca n't offer more stability , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung though the berliner zeitung expressed confidence that prodi would be reinstated , it agreed that the problems are not just superficial , but that the prime minister is on shaky ground . " prodi will give a less left-wing , more middle-of-the-line platform speech and call for a vote of confidence , " wrote the paper monday .
" and he 's likely to get it .
very likely . " abroad , people tend to see the government crisis as " part of the normal craziness " of italy 's politics , continued the paper .
" was the ' blitz ' crisis a farce in the end ?
and will prodi come out of it even stronger , as some political analysts suggest ?
was prodi 's resignation a victory march from the beginning ? " asked the commentary . " no , no , no . "
by sending prodi back to parliament , " it 's down to the wire again , " concluded the berliner zeitung . italy no better off with berlusconi " italy is n't ready for a grand coalition , " opined the stuttgarter zeitung sunday .
" the right-wing camp - still disheveled from the electoral defeat , occupied and blocked by berlusconi , lacking orientation in terms of direction , formation and personnel - could not guarantee more stability at this time than prodi and his people . " an election now would just destroy the economic and atmospheric recovery that italy had achieved during prodi 's nine months in power , continued the paper . the government needs to make a pit stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is like an old race car , said ferrari 's chairman frankfurter allgemeine zeitung summed up the political crisis in italy with the words of luca di montezemolo , chairman of ferrari , who said , " the political system in italy is like an old race car that needs a thorough maintenance check .
otherwise , italy will always lag behind the competition , no matter who 's in the driver 's seat . " the prodi crisis is an indication that italy is in urgent need of electoral , said the paper .
" the vicious circle of instability and political impotence can only be broken if the number of parties in parliament is reduced over the long-term and the prime minister has more power .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims .

" " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .
he pointed out that though a new group was trying to promote democratization in the village , " not much has happened .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims . " nobody wants to be a witness " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany faces a particular challenge from right-wing extremists the court in magdeburg has invited eight witnesses to the trial , which is expected to draw much media attention around germany .
however media reports say the gathering of evidence and testimonies is not expected to be easy . though some 80 inhabitants of the 900-strong village of pretzien are said to have witnessed the book burning last june , few are expected to come forward and talk about it . " a huge silence hangs over the place , " andreas holtz , the local protestant priest told berlin-based daily die tageszeitung .
" people would rather stay silent than say something wrong .
nobody wants to be a witness . " " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .
he pointed out that though a new group was trying to promote democratization in the village , " not much has happened .
we do n't have a panacea . " the head of the berlin-based anne frank center , thomas heppener , who will be at the trial , told the same paper that the book-burning was in no way " a coincidental act by drunken youngsters , " but rather one that its roots in the organized neo-nazi scene . trial raises questions about police lapses the trial has also raised serious questions about the role of the police and how they deal with right-wing crimes . in the case of the burning of anne frank 's diary in pretzien , local police apparently first deemed the crime as a mere " disturbance to peace " because they were n't familiar with the book and thus unable to grasp the intensity and political dimension of the act .
they only began investigations and raids in earnest ten days after the crime . " unfortunately many police officers in germany need to massively refresh their knowledge of the nazi-era and the role played at the time by their profession , " detlef von schwerin , head of a documentation and research group on police history at a police college in the eastern state of brandenburg told german news agency dpa . the state of saxony-anhalt where the diary of anne frank was burned however seems to have drawn some lessons from the crime . according to klaus-peter knobloch , spokesman of the state 's interior ministry , the state has already modified police training programs in response to the crime . " in seminars and other events , officers have since been increasingly learning about the nazi-era , the historical context and in particular the current manifestations of the right-wing scene .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture . " they are very , very common weapons of torture , " said manfred nowak , a human rights commissioner for the united nations .
" a torture method that causes a lot of pain but ca n't really be proven without eye witnesses is exactly what modern torturers prefer . " un calls for ban in great britain , the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , switzerland and scandinavia , selling electro-shockers is forbidden .
this is , however , not the case in germany , which ranks second behind the united states in exporting the devices .
german exporters need only apply for a license to sell the torture devices abroad . " it is my wish that every country in the world would completely outlaw the export of all electro-shock weapons and punish violators with high monetary fines or prison sentences , " nowak said . boris bauer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble .

the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

he has not raced since and currently lives in switzerland . spanish blood scandal in may , spain 's civil guard raided spanish addresses and found anabolic steroids , blood transfusion equipment , dozens of bags of frozen blood and documents listing some 200 professional athletes , including cyclists , who police said were receiving illegal doping products and treatment from a spanish doctor . nine riders said by police to be on that list were withdrawn from the tour de france before the start in july , including ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich 's tour de france win was the highlight of his career ullrich has strenuously denied the doping allegations , but he was suspended and then sacked by his t-mobile team in july .
he then took legal steps to prevent dna evidence being obtained from switzerland for comparison , although he has since agreed to provide bonn prosecutors with a dna sample .

but will prodi be reinstated later this week ? after prodi submitted his resignation last wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano asked him and his left-center coalition to stand a vote of confidence in parliament .
the vote is expected to take place on thursday , but the government will decide monday on an exact appointment . in an effort to unify his coalition , which is split on a variety of issues including pension reform , italian troops in afghanistan and rights for homosexual couples , prodi presented a 12-point-pact to his coalition partners last thursday in an effort to bridge the divides . 12-point-plan does n't solve the problem the coalition 's biggest problem - that it " spans from communists to christian democrats " - ca n't be solved with its new 12-point program , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung on monday .
" to find a common denominator , it wo n't be enough to declare a new ' spirit ' and sign a blank check with the 12-point plan . " prodi does n't have a secure majority , continued the paper .
prodi is on thin ice , but " the real test will come in march with the impending afghanistan vote and retirement reform . " down to the wire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former pm silvio berlusconi ca n't offer more stability , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung though the berliner zeitung expressed confidence that prodi would be reinstated , it agreed that the problems are not just superficial , but that the prime minister is on shaky ground . " prodi will give a less left-wing , more middle-of-the-line platform speech and call for a vote of confidence , " wrote the paper monday .
" and he 's likely to get it .
very likely . " abroad , people tend to see the government crisis as " part of the normal craziness " of italy 's politics , continued the paper .
" was the ' blitz ' crisis a farce in the end ?
and will prodi come out of it even stronger , as some political analysts suggest ?
was prodi 's resignation a victory march from the beginning ? " asked the commentary . " no , no , no . "
by sending prodi back to parliament , " it 's down to the wire again , " concluded the berliner zeitung . italy no better off with berlusconi " italy is n't ready for a grand coalition , " opined the stuttgarter zeitung sunday .
" the right-wing camp - still disheveled from the electoral defeat , occupied and blocked by berlusconi , lacking orientation in terms of direction , formation and personnel - could not guarantee more stability at this time than prodi and his people . " an election now would just destroy the economic and atmospheric recovery that italy had achieved during prodi 's nine months in power , continued the paper . the government needs to make a pit stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is like an old race car , said ferrari 's chairman frankfurter allgemeine zeitung summed up the political crisis in italy with the words of luca di montezemolo , chairman of ferrari , who said , " the political system in italy is like an old race car that needs a thorough maintenance check .
otherwise , italy will always lag behind the competition , no matter who 's in the driver 's seat . " the prodi crisis is an indication that italy is in urgent need of electoral , said the paper .
" the vicious circle of instability and political impotence can only be broken if the number of parties in parliament is reduced over the long-term and the prime minister has more power .

" the granting of regulatory holidays to incumbent operators is an attempt to stifle competition in a crucial sector of the economy , and in violation of the eu telecom rules in place since 2002 , " she added . telekom enjoying unfair advantage ? germany is building a fiber optic network that is supposed to cover 50 cities and expected to cost 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- . the network is already up and running in 10 cities but deutsche telekom asked the government to allow it to block access to rivals during the first years of operation to help recoup its investment costs . " in the commission 's view , the german law , as now adopted , jeopardizes the competitive position of deutsche telekom 's existing competitors and makes it much harder for new competitors to enter german markets , " the eu executive said in a statement . moreover , the commission said the law went against the wishes of the german internet authority , the bundesnetzagentur , which has also called on deutsche telekom to allow rivals to use the network . with no indication that berlin intends to back down , the commission could seek a injunction or a fast-track case before the european court of justice . along with poland , germany now faces the highest number of eu legal proceedings against it with six pending cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom enjoys a huge share of the national telephone market deutsche telekom , about 32 percent of which is owned by the german state , enjoys a broad share of the national telephone market , controlling access of 9,400,000 lines in germany out of a total of 12,900,000 lines . however , there is considerable scope for the former state monopoly to strengthen its hand in the internet access market with germany having a broadband penetration rate in germany at well below other leading eu countries . the commission estimates that only 16 percent of the german population has access to broadband internet access compared with nearly 30 percent in denmark and the netherlands . preventing germany from setting an example analyst theo kitz at german bank merck fink said deutsche telekom has run into relatively weak demand among customers for broadband access mainly because it is too expensive . " they have told us the customer take-up is slow , " he said .
" in my opinion , it 's because of pricing , they have to lower prices . " he predicted that the european commission would take a " hard line " in the case so as not to tempt other companies in other countries to try to seek regulatory holidays . " they 're very tough and very serious because they fear that if they open the door a little some other company will push it open , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 26.02.2007 statement by convicted terrorist casts doubt on pardon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's manifesto was too bring down the capitalist state through violence a german terrorist hoping for parole has released a written statement that has raised eyebrows .
its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future .

the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

" it was definitely not a run of the mill case , " fischer told a parliamentary committee investigating the case of murat kurnaz on monday .
" we tended to the case as well as we could . " fischer also said the german government was uncertain if kurnaz posed a threat to the country 's national security and called accusations leveled at current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of working to keep kurnaz from returning to germany " simply wrong . " opposition party members accused fischer of not having done enough for kurnaz ' release , charges the former minister denied , saying he told then us secretary of state colin powell to either charge or release kurnaz . us decision made at " higher level " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he and powell agreed on releasing or charging kurnaz powell was open to releasing the kurnaz , according to fischer , who added that the decisions to keep him imprisoned " were at higher levels . "
fischer added that the us position not to release kurnaz kept him from discussing the issue with former interior minister otto schily . us forces seized kurnaz in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states and he was later sent to a us prison in afghanistan before being incarcerated at guantanamo bay in 2002 . he was released last august because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization , following repeated appeals by current chancellor angela merkel to the us government after she took power in november 2005 . " tragic case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz answered the german committee 's questions in january earlier on monday , former deputy interior minister claus henning schapper told the committee that being held at guantanamo , where kurnaz could not contact bremen authorities , did not change the fact that his residence permit was legally invalid after spending six months outside germany . calling kurnaz ' imprisonment a " tragic case , " schapper said he was not informed of a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 by the former head of the foreign intelligence service and current interior ministry deputy minister august hanning and former deputy president of constitutional protection and now secret service coordinator at the chancellery klaus-dieter fritsche . no consideration to kurnaz ' fate german intelligence agents allegedly interrogated kurnaz while he was in the us military prison on cuba and came to the conclusion he did not pose a threat to germany . a report by the european union said last month that the agents deemed kurnaz not to be a threat and accused the previous german ruling coalition of social democrats and greens of refusing accept kurnaz upon release from guantanamo . " everything possible was attempted to keep kurnaz away from germany without thinking of what his fate would be , " said max stadler , who serves on the committee and is a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats . greens party committee member hans-christian ströbele said the entire situation seemed " hardly believable .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

" the granting of regulatory holidays to incumbent operators is an attempt to stifle competition in a crucial sector of the economy , and in violation of the eu telecom rules in place since 2002 , " she added . telekom enjoying unfair advantage ? germany is building a fiber optic network that is supposed to cover 50 cities and expected to cost 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- . the network is already up and running in 10 cities but deutsche telekom asked the government to allow it to block access to rivals during the first years of operation to help recoup its investment costs . " in the commission 's view , the german law , as now adopted , jeopardizes the competitive position of deutsche telekom 's existing competitors and makes it much harder for new competitors to enter german markets , " the eu executive said in a statement . moreover , the commission said the law went against the wishes of the german internet authority , the bundesnetzagentur , which has also called on deutsche telekom to allow rivals to use the network . with no indication that berlin intends to back down , the commission could seek a injunction or a fast-track case before the european court of justice . along with poland , germany now faces the highest number of eu legal proceedings against it with six pending cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom enjoys a huge share of the national telephone market deutsche telekom , about 32 percent of which is owned by the german state , enjoys a broad share of the national telephone market , controlling access of 9,400,000 lines in germany out of a total of 12,900,000 lines . however , there is considerable scope for the former state monopoly to strengthen its hand in the internet access market with germany having a broadband penetration rate in germany at well below other leading eu countries . the commission estimates that only 16 percent of the german population has access to broadband internet access compared with nearly 30 percent in denmark and the netherlands . preventing germany from setting an example analyst theo kitz at german bank merck fink said deutsche telekom has run into relatively weak demand among customers for broadband access mainly because it is too expensive . " they have told us the customer take-up is slow , " he said .
" in my opinion , it 's because of pricing , they have to lower prices . " he predicted that the european commission would take a " hard line " in the case so as not to tempt other companies in other countries to try to seek regulatory holidays . " they 're very tough and very serious because they fear that if they open the door a little some other company will push it open , " he said .
" if they make an exception in a country , some others could follow .

" the comment drew a simple retort from us secretary of state , condoleeza rice , who said : " they do n't need a reverse gear .
they need a stop button . " a low-key meeting on the eve of the talks , the united states reaffirmed its offer of direct talks with tehran - but a report claimed washington is stepping up covert operations in iran in a new strategy that could spark an " open confrontation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains at his belligerent best us under secretary for political affairs nicholas burns was to hold talks in london with counterparts numbers from britain , china , france , germany and russia , to hammer out how best to persuade tehran to comply with united nations demands . the un imposed a first round of limited economic sanctions against iran in december after it refused to comply with an earlier demand to suspend enrichment activities . now the six countries - the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany - must decide on how to respond to the lapsing of a 60-day deadline . the us , france and britain want the security council to impose fresh sanctions but russia and china , which hold veto rights and have economic , energy and strategic interests in iran , are reluctant to pile on the pressure . the london talks are expected to lay the groundwork for a security council meeting which could take place within the next week . the foreign office said the meeting would be low-key , with no decisions on action in relation to iran expected to be announced . " this is very much an initial discreet discussion at senior official level to discuss further measures on iran , " a spokesman said .
" officials will want to discuss any conclusions that arise out of the meeting with ministers in their capitals . " the international atomic energy agency , the un 's nuclear watchdog , confirmed thursday that iran had ignored the security council 's demand to stop enriching uranium - a possible route to developing nuclear weapons - and had expanded its nuclear program . russia worried about military strikes against iran condoleezza rice said sunday that she was confident the six nations could find common ground and again offered to hold negotiations with iran if it suspends enrichment .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 26.02.2007 german press review : " italy is like an old race car " ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi and his left-center coalition will face a vote of confidence later this week italian pm romano prodi 's resignation and the subsequent call for a vote of confidence for his shaky left-center coalition are a sign of deeper problems in italy .
but will prodi be reinstated later this week ? after prodi submitted his resignation last wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano asked him and his left-center coalition to stand a vote of confidence in parliament .
the vote is expected to take place on thursday , but the government will decide monday on an exact appointment . in an effort to unify his coalition , which is split on a variety of issues including pension reform , italian troops in afghanistan and rights for homosexual couples , prodi presented a 12-point-pact to his coalition partners last thursday in an effort to bridge the divides . 12-point-plan does n't solve the problem the coalition 's biggest problem - that it " spans from communists to christian democrats " - ca n't be solved with its new 12-point program , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung on monday .
" to find a common denominator , it wo n't be enough to declare a new ' spirit ' and sign a blank check with the 12-point plan . " prodi does n't have a secure majority , continued the paper .
prodi is on thin ice , but " the real test will come in march with the impending afghanistan vote and retirement reform . " down to the wire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former pm silvio berlusconi ca n't offer more stability , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung though the berliner zeitung expressed confidence that prodi would be reinstated , it agreed that the problems are not just superficial , but that the prime minister is on shaky ground . " prodi will give a less left-wing , more middle-of-the-line platform speech and call for a vote of confidence , " wrote the paper monday .
" and he 's likely to get it .
very likely . " abroad , people tend to see the government crisis as " part of the normal craziness " of italy 's politics , continued the paper .
" was the ' blitz ' crisis a farce in the end ?
and will prodi come out of it even stronger , as some political analysts suggest ?
was prodi 's resignation a victory march from the beginning ? " asked the commentary . " no , no , no . "
by sending prodi back to parliament , " it 's down to the wire again , " concluded the berliner zeitung . italy no better off with berlusconi " italy is n't ready for a grand coalition , " opined the stuttgarter zeitung sunday .
" the right-wing camp - still disheveled from the electoral defeat , occupied and blocked by berlusconi , lacking orientation in terms of direction , formation and personnel - could not guarantee more stability at this time than prodi and his people . " an election now would just destroy the economic and atmospheric recovery that italy had achieved during prodi 's nine months in power , continued the paper . the government needs to make a pit stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is like an old race car , said ferrari 's chairman frankfurter allgemeine zeitung summed up the political crisis in italy with the words of luca di montezemolo , chairman of ferrari , who said , " the political system in italy is like an old race car that needs a thorough maintenance check .
otherwise , italy will always lag behind the competition , no matter who 's in the driver 's seat . " the prodi crisis is an indication that italy is in urgent need of electoral , said the paper .
" the vicious circle of instability and political impotence can only be broken if the number of parties in parliament is reduced over the long-term and the prime minister has more power . " prodi 's left-center coalition is made up of nine or ten parties , depending on how they are counted , wrote faz , and the opposition has four parties . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president asks prodi to stay prime minister italian president giorgio napolitano on saturday rejected prime minister romano prodi 's resignation offer and asked him to test support for his center-left government in a parliamentary vote of confidence .
-lrb- 24.02.2007 -rrb- italy 's political future uncertain as talks continue political experts have said a snap general election was unlikely in italy , as crisis talks began on the government 's future following prime minister romano prodi 's decision to step down on wednesday .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" the granting of regulatory holidays to incumbent operators is an attempt to stifle competition in a crucial sector of the economy , and in violation of the eu telecom rules in place since 2002 , " she added . telekom enjoying unfair advantage ? germany is building a fiber optic network that is supposed to cover 50 cities and expected to cost 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- . the network is already up and running in 10 cities but deutsche telekom asked the government to allow it to block access to rivals during the first years of operation to help recoup its investment costs . " in the commission 's view , the german law , as now adopted , jeopardizes the competitive position of deutsche telekom 's existing competitors and makes it much harder for new competitors to enter german markets , " the eu executive said in a statement . moreover , the commission said the law went against the wishes of the german internet authority , the bundesnetzagentur , which has also called on deutsche telekom to allow rivals to use the network . with no indication that berlin intends to back down , the commission could seek a injunction or a fast-track case before the european court of justice . along with poland , germany now faces the highest number of eu legal proceedings against it with six pending cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom enjoys a huge share of the national telephone market deutsche telekom , about 32 percent of which is owned by the german state , enjoys a broad share of the national telephone market , controlling access of 9,400,000 lines in germany out of a total of 12,900,000 lines . however , there is considerable scope for the former state monopoly to strengthen its hand in the internet access market with germany having a broadband penetration rate in germany at well below other leading eu countries . the commission estimates that only 16 percent of the german population has access to broadband internet access compared with nearly 30 percent in denmark and the netherlands . preventing germany from setting an example analyst theo kitz at german bank merck fink said deutsche telekom has run into relatively weak demand among customers for broadband access mainly because it is too expensive . " they have told us the customer take-up is slow , " he said .
" in my opinion , it 's because of pricing , they have to lower prices . " he predicted that the european commission would take a " hard line " in the case so as not to tempt other companies in other countries to try to seek regulatory holidays . " they 're very tough and very serious because they fear that if they open the door a little some other company will push it open , " he said .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse . " i understand the feelings of the victims and regret the suffering of these people , " klar wrote to the then german president johannes rau in 2003 , said der spiegel newsmagazine .
the letter forms part of a 130-page report drafted for köhler . unwise move helmut kury , a criminologist who has been heavily involved in the pardon request , said he was surprised by klar 's statement and that most citizens would conclude that klar had not learned anything during his incarceration . " he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims . " nobody wants to be a witness " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany faces a particular challenge from right-wing extremists the court in magdeburg has invited eight witnesses to the trial , which is expected to draw much media attention around germany .
however media reports say the gathering of evidence and testimonies is not expected to be easy . though some 80 inhabitants of the 900-strong village of pretzien are said to have witnessed the book burning last june , few are expected to come forward and talk about it . " a huge silence hangs over the place , " andreas holtz , the local protestant priest told berlin-based daily die tageszeitung .
" people would rather stay silent than say something wrong .
nobody wants to be a witness . " " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .
he pointed out that though a new group was trying to promote democratization in the village , " not much has happened .
we do n't have a panacea . " the head of the berlin-based anne frank center , thomas heppener , who will be at the trial , told the same paper that the book-burning was in no way " a coincidental act by drunken youngsters , " but rather one that its roots in the organized neo-nazi scene . trial raises questions about police lapses the trial has also raised serious questions about the role of the police and how they deal with right-wing crimes . in the case of the burning of anne frank 's diary in pretzien , local police apparently first deemed the crime as a mere " disturbance to peace " because they were n't familiar with the book and thus unable to grasp the intensity and political dimension of the act .
they only began investigations and raids in earnest ten days after the crime . " unfortunately many police officers in germany need to massively refresh their knowledge of the nazi-era and the role played at the time by their profession , " detlef von schwerin , head of a documentation and research group on police history at a police college in the eastern state of brandenburg told german news agency dpa . the state of saxony-anhalt where the diary of anne frank was burned however seems to have drawn some lessons from the crime . according to klaus-peter knobloch , spokesman of the state 's interior ministry , the state has already modified police training programs in response to the crime . " in seminars and other events , officers have since been increasingly learning about the nazi-era , the historical context and in particular the current manifestations of the right-wing scene .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims . " nobody wants to be a witness " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany faces a particular challenge from right-wing extremists the court in magdeburg has invited eight witnesses to the trial , which is expected to draw much media attention around germany .
however media reports say the gathering of evidence and testimonies is not expected to be easy . though some 80 inhabitants of the 900-strong village of pretzien are said to have witnessed the book burning last june , few are expected to come forward and talk about it . " a huge silence hangs over the place , " andreas holtz , the local protestant priest told berlin-based daily die tageszeitung .
" people would rather stay silent than say something wrong .
nobody wants to be a witness . " " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .
he pointed out that though a new group was trying to promote democratization in the village , " not much has happened .
we do n't have a panacea . " the head of the berlin-based anne frank center , thomas heppener , who will be at the trial , told the same paper that the book-burning was in no way " a coincidental act by drunken youngsters , " but rather one that its roots in the organized neo-nazi scene . trial raises questions about police lapses the trial has also raised serious questions about the role of the police and how they deal with right-wing crimes . in the case of the burning of anne frank 's diary in pretzien , local police apparently first deemed the crime as a mere " disturbance to peace " because they were n't familiar with the book and thus unable to grasp the intensity and political dimension of the act .
they only began investigations and raids in earnest ten days after the crime . " unfortunately many police officers in germany need to massively refresh their knowledge of the nazi-era and the role played at the time by their profession , " detlef von schwerin , head of a documentation and research group on police history at a police college in the eastern state of brandenburg told german news agency dpa . the state of saxony-anhalt where the diary of anne frank was burned however seems to have drawn some lessons from the crime . according to klaus-peter knobloch , spokesman of the state 's interior ministry , the state has already modified police training programs in response to the crime . " in seminars and other events , officers have since been increasingly learning about the nazi-era , the historical context and in particular the current manifestations of the right-wing scene .

" the comment drew a simple retort from us secretary of state , condoleeza rice , who said : " they do n't need a reverse gear .
they need a stop button . " a low-key meeting on the eve of the talks , the united states reaffirmed its offer of direct talks with tehran - but a report claimed washington is stepping up covert operations in iran in a new strategy that could spark an " open confrontation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains at his belligerent best us under secretary for political affairs nicholas burns was to hold talks in london with counterparts numbers from britain , china , france , germany and russia , to hammer out how best to persuade tehran to comply with united nations demands . the un imposed a first round of limited economic sanctions against iran in december after it refused to comply with an earlier demand to suspend enrichment activities . now the six countries - the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany - must decide on how to respond to the lapsing of a 60-day deadline . the us , france and britain want the security council to impose fresh sanctions but russia and china , which hold veto rights and have economic , energy and strategic interests in iran , are reluctant to pile on the pressure . the london talks are expected to lay the groundwork for a security council meeting which could take place within the next week . the foreign office said the meeting would be low-key , with no decisions on action in relation to iran expected to be announced . " this is very much an initial discreet discussion at senior official level to discuss further measures on iran , " a spokesman said .
" officials will want to discuss any conclusions that arise out of the meeting with ministers in their capitals . " the international atomic energy agency , the un 's nuclear watchdog , confirmed thursday that iran had ignored the security council 's demand to stop enriching uranium - a possible route to developing nuclear weapons - and had expanded its nuclear program . russia worried about military strikes against iran condoleezza rice said sunday that she was confident the six nations could find common ground and again offered to hold negotiations with iran if it suspends enrichment .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture . " they are very , very common weapons of torture , " said manfred nowak , a human rights commissioner for the united nations .
" a torture method that causes a lot of pain but ca n't really be proven without eye witnesses is exactly what modern torturers prefer . " un calls for ban in great britain , the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , switzerland and scandinavia , selling electro-shockers is forbidden .
this is , however , not the case in germany , which ranks second behind the united states in exporting the devices .
german exporters need only apply for a license to sell the torture devices abroad .

" it was definitely not a run of the mill case , " fischer told a parliamentary committee investigating the case of murat kurnaz on monday .
" we tended to the case as well as we could . " fischer also said the german government was uncertain if kurnaz posed a threat to the country 's national security and called accusations leveled at current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of working to keep kurnaz from returning to germany " simply wrong . " opposition party members accused fischer of not having done enough for kurnaz ' release , charges the former minister denied , saying he told then us secretary of state colin powell to either charge or release kurnaz . us decision made at " higher level " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he and powell agreed on releasing or charging kurnaz powell was open to releasing the kurnaz , according to fischer , who added that the decisions to keep him imprisoned " were at higher levels .

fischer added that the us position not to release kurnaz kept him from discussing the issue with former interior minister otto schily . us forces seized kurnaz in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states and he was later sent to a us prison in afghanistan before being incarcerated at guantanamo bay in 2002 . he was released last august because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization , following repeated appeals by current chancellor angela merkel to the us government after she took power in november 2005 . " tragic case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz answered the german committee 's questions in january earlier on monday , former deputy interior minister claus henning schapper told the committee that being held at guantanamo , where kurnaz could not contact bremen authorities , did not change the fact that his residence permit was legally invalid after spending six months outside germany . calling kurnaz ' imprisonment a " tragic case , " schapper said he was not informed of a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 by the former head of the foreign intelligence service and current interior ministry deputy minister august hanning and former deputy president of constitutional protection and now secret service coordinator at the chancellery klaus-dieter fritsche . no consideration to kurnaz ' fate german intelligence agents allegedly interrogated kurnaz while he was in the us military prison on cuba and came to the conclusion he did not pose a threat to germany . a report by the european union said last month that the agents deemed kurnaz not to be a threat and accused the previous german ruling coalition of social democrats and greens of refusing accept kurnaz upon release from guantanamo . " everything possible was attempted to keep kurnaz away from germany without thinking of what his fate would be , " said max stadler , who serves on the committee and is a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats . greens party committee member hans-christian ströbele said the entire situation seemed " hardly believable .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

but will prodi be reinstated later this week ? after prodi submitted his resignation last wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano asked him and his left-center coalition to stand a vote of confidence in parliament .
the vote is expected to take place on thursday , but the government will decide monday on an exact appointment . in an effort to unify his coalition , which is split on a variety of issues including pension reform , italian troops in afghanistan and rights for homosexual couples , prodi presented a 12-point-pact to his coalition partners last thursday in an effort to bridge the divides . 12-point-plan does n't solve the problem the coalition 's biggest problem - that it " spans from communists to christian democrats " - ca n't be solved with its new 12-point program , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung on monday .
" to find a common denominator , it wo n't be enough to declare a new ' spirit ' and sign a blank check with the 12-point plan . " prodi does n't have a secure majority , continued the paper .
prodi is on thin ice , but " the real test will come in march with the impending afghanistan vote and retirement reform . " down to the wire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former pm silvio berlusconi ca n't offer more stability , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung though the berliner zeitung expressed confidence that prodi would be reinstated , it agreed that the problems are not just superficial , but that the prime minister is on shaky ground . " prodi will give a less left-wing , more middle-of-the-line platform speech and call for a vote of confidence , " wrote the paper monday .
" and he 's likely to get it .
very likely . " abroad , people tend to see the government crisis as " part of the normal craziness " of italy 's politics , continued the paper .
" was the ' blitz ' crisis a farce in the end ?
and will prodi come out of it even stronger , as some political analysts suggest ?
was prodi 's resignation a victory march from the beginning ? " asked the commentary . " no , no , no . "
by sending prodi back to parliament , " it 's down to the wire again , " concluded the berliner zeitung . italy no better off with berlusconi " italy is n't ready for a grand coalition , " opined the stuttgarter zeitung sunday .
" the right-wing camp - still disheveled from the electoral defeat , occupied and blocked by berlusconi , lacking orientation in terms of direction , formation and personnel - could not guarantee more stability at this time than prodi and his people . " an election now would just destroy the economic and atmospheric recovery that italy had achieved during prodi 's nine months in power , continued the paper . the government needs to make a pit stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is like an old race car , said ferrari 's chairman frankfurter allgemeine zeitung summed up the political crisis in italy with the words of luca di montezemolo , chairman of ferrari , who said , " the political system in italy is like an old race car that needs a thorough maintenance check .
otherwise , italy will always lag behind the competition , no matter who 's in the driver 's seat . " the prodi crisis is an indication that italy is in urgent need of electoral , said the paper .
" the vicious circle of instability and political impotence can only be broken if the number of parties in parliament is reduced over the long-term and the prime minister has more power . " prodi 's left-center coalition is made up of nine or ten parties , depending on how they are counted , wrote faz , and the opposition has four parties . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president asks prodi to stay prime minister italian president giorgio napolitano on saturday rejected prime minister romano prodi 's resignation offer and asked him to test support for his center-left government in a parliamentary vote of confidence .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

but will prodi be reinstated later this week ? after prodi submitted his resignation last wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano asked him and his left-center coalition to stand a vote of confidence in parliament .
the vote is expected to take place on thursday , but the government will decide monday on an exact appointment . in an effort to unify his coalition , which is split on a variety of issues including pension reform , italian troops in afghanistan and rights for homosexual couples , prodi presented a 12-point-pact to his coalition partners last thursday in an effort to bridge the divides . 12-point-plan does n't solve the problem the coalition 's biggest problem - that it " spans from communists to christian democrats " - ca n't be solved with its new 12-point program , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung on monday .
" to find a common denominator , it wo n't be enough to declare a new ' spirit ' and sign a blank check with the 12-point plan . " prodi does n't have a secure majority , continued the paper .

" prodi will give a less left-wing , more middle-of-the-line platform speech and call for a vote of confidence , " wrote the paper monday .
" and he 's likely to get it .
very likely . " abroad , people tend to see the government crisis as " part of the normal craziness " of italy 's politics , continued the paper .
" was the ' blitz ' crisis a farce in the end ?
and will prodi come out of it even stronger , as some political analysts suggest ?
was prodi 's resignation a victory march from the beginning ? " asked the commentary . " no , no , no . "
by sending prodi back to parliament , " it 's down to the wire again , " concluded the berliner zeitung . italy no better off with berlusconi " italy is n't ready for a grand coalition , " opined the stuttgarter zeitung sunday .
" the right-wing camp - still disheveled from the electoral defeat , occupied and blocked by berlusconi , lacking orientation in terms of direction , formation and personnel - could not guarantee more stability at this time than prodi and his people .

otherwise , italy will always lag behind the competition , no matter who 's in the driver 's seat . " the prodi crisis is an indication that italy is in urgent need of electoral , said the paper .
" the vicious circle of instability and political impotence can only be broken if the number of parties in parliament is reduced over the long-term and the prime minister has more power .

the other five defendants did not address the court .
the suspects , ranging in age from 24 to 29 , stand accused of inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead .
they face up to five years in prison if convicted . konrad , 25 , said in his statement that he had aimed to free himself " from an evil chapter of german history " but had no intention of denying the nazis ' crimes . " he is very sorry that he was misunderstood , " his attorney thomas jauch told the court . but state prosecutor arnold murra dismissed konrad 's account , saying that the defendants intended to " glorify " the nazis with the book-burning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infamous book burnings by the nazis on may 10 , 1933 in berlin " you ridiculed anne frank and with her all the victims of the concentration camps , " he said . the case sparked outrage in germany and abroad when it came to light , fuelling fears that neo-nazi ideology is spreading through the economically depressed states of the former east germany . the act is reported to have taken place on june 24 , 2006 during a midsummer night 's party in pretzien , a tiny village near magdeburg , the capital of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt . anne frank 's diary of life hiding from the nazis is world famous and has sold some 75 million copies worldwide . the young men , who are suspected to be from the far-right scene , are said to have modeled the destruction of the diary on the infamous nazi book-burnings in berlin .
shouting martial slogans and bearing flaming torches , the group is reported to have first tossed a us flag into a bonfire followed by the famous " diary of anne frank . " the state prosecutors ' office said in a statement before the trial opened that " by using clear-cut neo-nazi and nazi terminology , " the men had not just mocked anne frank , who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15 , but also all the other millions of nazi victims . " nobody wants to be a witness " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany faces a particular challenge from right-wing extremists the court in magdeburg has invited eight witnesses to the trial , which is expected to draw much media attention around germany .
however media reports say the gathering of evidence and testimonies is not expected to be easy . though some 80 inhabitants of the 900-strong village of pretzien are said to have witnessed the book burning last june , few are expected to come forward and talk about it . " a huge silence hangs over the place , " andreas holtz , the local protestant priest told berlin-based daily die tageszeitung .
" people would rather stay silent than say something wrong .
nobody wants to be a witness . " " no coincidental act by drunken youngsters " the paper pointed out that the case illustrates the difficulties of small towns and villages - particularly in former east germany where statistics show right-wing crimes are on the rise - in tackling the far-right scene and their dissemination of extremist ideology . the paper said the seven accused were hardly marginal figures in the village ; one of them apparently sings in the local male choir while two are involved in the voluntary fire department . men belonging to a recognized club in the village also freely sported t-shirts emblazoned with the words , " wehrmacht pretzien , " without anyone taking exception to it , the paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police who dealt with the book-burning case in pretzien were not familiar with the diary of anne frank " we need more enlightenment , " a local leader frithjof meussling told die tageszeitung .

" the head of the berlin-based anne frank center , thomas heppener , who will be at the trial , told the same paper that the book-burning was in no way " a coincidental act by drunken youngsters , " but rather one that its roots in the organized neo-nazi scene . trial raises questions about police lapses the trial has also raised serious questions about the role of the police and how they deal with right-wing crimes . in the case of the burning of anne frank 's diary in pretzien , local police apparently first deemed the crime as a mere " disturbance to peace " because they were n't familiar with the book and thus unable to grasp the intensity and political dimension of the act .
they only began investigations and raids in earnest ten days after the crime . " unfortunately many police officers in germany need to massively refresh their knowledge of the nazi-era and the role played at the time by their profession , " detlef von schwerin , head of a documentation and research group on police history at a police college in the eastern state of brandenburg told german news agency dpa . the state of saxony-anhalt where the diary of anne frank was burned however seems to have drawn some lessons from the crime . according to klaus-peter knobloch , spokesman of the state 's interior ministry , the state has already modified police training programs in response to the crime . " in seminars and other events , officers have since been increasingly learning about the nazi-era , the historical context and in particular the current manifestations of the right-wing scene .

they need a stop button .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future .

the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" he did n't do himself any favors , " he told the television program , adding that the statement 's text ran parallel with the thinking once prevalent in the raf .
" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

this sensitively made stasi drama speaks to people with great urgency , " merkel said in a statement . the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . merkel , who is the first german chancellor who to have been raised in communist east germany , said the movie had helped the country come to terms with the communist past . strong determination for rookie film-maker director florian henckel von donnersmarck delivered the standard round of thank-yous to those who made the film possible , with a special word for arnold schwarzenegger " for teaching me the words ' i ca n't ' should be stricken from my vocabulary . " the film follows a top stasi agent , played by ulrich mühe , who is assigned to keep tabs on a successful playwright -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- and his live-in lover , a beautiful actress played by rising german star martina gedeck . in his first full-length feature , von donnersmarck took his inspiration from a quote by vladimir lenin that he could not afford to listen to beethoven because beautiful music might weaken his resolve to destroy any resistance to the bolshevik revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von donnersmarck 's film beat off stiff competition he said in interviews that this left him with the recurring image of a man who is listening to something but does not hear what he expects and comes away altered by the experience . and so the spy sits alone , passively but jealously listening in on every intimate detail of the artist couple 's relationship . he starts pulling strings from the shadows , changing the course of their lives but also his own perspective as he starts to realize and doubt what he is doing . film adds academy award to european prize the film , which picked up the european film award for best picture , was a box office success in germany , where almost 18 years after its collapse the communist era inspires a mixture of fascination , resentment and nostalgia . the impact the stasi had on people 's lives is still a raw wound , and the release of certain files remains the subject of a protracted political debate .
the dreaded secret service had more agents per capita than any other outfit of its kind in the world . von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne , west germany , and raised around the globe , was lauded for recreating the drab , chilly atmosphere of communist east berlin , though some critics pointed to a number of irritating anachronisms . star 's stasi experience brings authenticity not only did the stasi keep a file on him but he was able to bring valuable knowledge about the drama community behind the iron curtain to the project .
and in a case of art and life intersecting , mühe has repeatedly accused his former wife , jenny gröllmann , of spying for the stasi .
gröllmann was one of the most successful actresses in east germany , and she bitterly contested her ex-husband 's claims right up to her death last year from cancer .
their battle received widespread media attention while the film was showing in theaters . gröllmann eventually won a court order forbidding mühe from calling her a spy . meanwhile , the apartment where " the lives of others " was shot has become part of the itinerary of a guided tour of famous film locations in berlin . strong recent showing for german films at oscars germany has made a strong showing in oscar nominations in recent years , with the nazi-era dramas " downfall " and " sophie scholl - the final days " in the running for the best foreign-language film in 2005 and 2006 . the country 's last win in the category was in 2003 , with " nowhere in africa . " the film outdid " after the wedding , " from denmark ; " days of glory " -lrb- " indigenes " -rrb- , from algeria ; " pan 's labyrinth , " from mexico ; and " water , " from canada , to win the foreign-language oscar . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

its language indicates that he has n't abandoned the radical leftist ideology behind his one-time terrorist movement . christian klar , formerly a leading member of the terrorist red army faction , has cast doubts on his own rehabilitation during 25 years in prison with a statement he wrote which appears to mirror the views of the group primarily active in the 1970s and 80s . in a statement klar wrote in january for a marxist conference held in berlin , according to german public television , he expressed hopes that the time was ripe to " complete the defeat of capital and open the door to a new future . " he went on to denounce an " imperial alliance " in europe , which " allows itself to castigate from on high any country on earth which opposes being reformed for today 's redistribution of profits and turns its entire societal being into a pile of rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of klar 's views appear not to have changed according to the television report , klar 's statement was read to the conference attendees by a former far-left parliamentarian who has been accused of ties with the former east german secret police , the stasi . the development has raised concerns that klar , who has petitioned german president horst köhler for a pardon , may not have renounced the views that led him to become a top figure in the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , and have led some to call for a possible pardon to be reconsidered . leading raf figure klar , 54 , has been described as the " cold implementer " of the raf , a german terrorist group based on the so-called " urban guerrillas , " that was responsible for the deaths of 34 people in its decades-long existence .
the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture .

" a torture method that causes a lot of pain but ca n't really be proven without eye witnesses is exactly what modern torturers prefer . " un calls for ban in great britain , the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , switzerland and scandinavia , selling electro-shockers is forbidden .
this is , however , not the case in germany , which ranks second behind the united states in exporting the devices .
german exporters need only apply for a license to sell the torture devices abroad .

the group , many of whose members were educated and from the middle or upper classes , claimed to be fighting the " imperialism " of the united states and german society , which they said was still tainted by the nazi past . klar was arrested in 1982 and convicted of 20 counts of murder and attempted murder ; he was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar and brigitte mohnhaupt , a raf leader , who recently received a pardon speculation that klar will be released early has been spurred by evidence that he has shown remorse .

" however , you ca n't conclude that he is liable to commit the same acts he did back then . " bavarian premier edmund stoiber said the statement put the entire matter of a pardon in question . " after this call to arms against our basic values , the question is whether or not a life sentence for christian klar means that he belongs under lock and key permanently , " he said . a spokesperson for köhler , whose decision on a pardon is expected in the next few months , did not comment on klar 's statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

" the pain is extreme , " nedim baran told german public broadcaster ard of when he was tortured with an electro-shocker .
" you have the feeling your eyes are popping out of your head .
you think your head will explode .
you can only think about your death . " there are electro-contacts on one end that transfer up to 120,000 volts of electricity into the victim 's body - about 500 times the voltage delivered by a power outlet . " the electrons are applied in different places - to the ears , the tongue , the temples , the genitals , such as women 's nipples , and so on , " said mechthild weng anson a berlin doctor who has treated people tortured with such devices . only recently did the german customs office confirm that german companies export electro-shockers to countries where they are used for torture : 100 to iran , 84 to georgia , 115 to bangladesh . according to ard television , torture is currently practiced in 87 countries . little evidence of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak unlike other torture methods , however , the electro-shockers cause intense pain without leaving any visible wounds , they also make it difficult for doctors to prove that a patient had been subjected to this kind of torture . " they are very , very common weapons of torture , " said manfred nowak , a human rights commissioner for the united nations .
" a torture method that causes a lot of pain but ca n't really be proven without eye witnesses is exactly what modern torturers prefer . " un calls for ban in great britain , the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , switzerland and scandinavia , selling electro-shockers is forbidden .

they need a stop button .

" the granting of regulatory holidays to incumbent operators is an attempt to stifle competition in a crucial sector of the economy , and in violation of the eu telecom rules in place since 2002 , " she added . telekom enjoying unfair advantage ? germany is building a fiber optic network that is supposed to cover 50 cities and expected to cost 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- . the network is already up and running in 10 cities but deutsche telekom asked the government to allow it to block access to rivals during the first years of operation to help recoup its investment costs . " in the commission 's view , the german law , as now adopted , jeopardizes the competitive position of deutsche telekom 's existing competitors and makes it much harder for new competitors to enter german markets , " the eu executive said in a statement . moreover , the commission said the law went against the wishes of the german internet authority , the bundesnetzagentur , which has also called on deutsche telekom to allow rivals to use the network . with no indication that berlin intends to back down , the commission could seek a injunction or a fast-track case before the european court of justice . along with poland , germany now faces the highest number of eu legal proceedings against it with six pending cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom enjoys a huge share of the national telephone market deutsche telekom , about 32 percent of which is owned by the german state , enjoys a broad share of the national telephone market , controlling access of 9,400,000 lines in germany out of a total of 12,900,000 lines . however , there is considerable scope for the former state monopoly to strengthen its hand in the internet access market with germany having a broadband penetration rate in germany at well below other leading eu countries . the commission estimates that only 16 percent of the german population has access to broadband internet access compared with nearly 30 percent in denmark and the netherlands . preventing germany from setting an example analyst theo kitz at german bank merck fink said deutsche telekom has run into relatively weak demand among customers for broadband access mainly because it is too expensive . " they have told us the customer take-up is slow , " he said .
" in my opinion , it 's because of pricing , they have to lower prices . " he predicted that the european commission would take a " hard line " in the case so as not to tempt other companies in other countries to try to seek regulatory holidays . " they 're very tough and very serious because they fear that if they open the door a little some other company will push it open , " he said .

research by the children 's 24-hour hotline found some girls even rang them while trying to take their own life .
in all the charity , which is urging more funding , had almost 1,000 calls on mental health problems .
the assembly government voiced concern about suicide rates among young people in wales and said it was taking action .
on one occasion a counsellor with the service now provided by the nspcc even helped save the life of a girl who had taken an overdose in her bedroom while her parents were downstairs , unaware of what was going on .
after getting the youngster 's agreement , the counsellor called the emergency services .
an ambulance arrived at the house in time to save the girl and her father rang childline the following day to thank them . "
there 's no point .
no-one cares about me " teenager caller to childline four out of five - a total of 157 - suicide calls received by childline at rhyl and swansea last year came from girls , but there were also 36 from boys .
difficulties outlined by callers typically included living with someone with mental health problems or with parents who were abusive , neglectful or who drank too much .
one 15-year-old boy said : " i 've taken some tablets and drunk a bottle of vodka .
" there 's no point .
no-one cares about me .
my mum did n't even notice that i 've self-harmed .
i have nothing to feel good about anymore . "
a girl of 14 pleaded : " mum has been on anti-depressants for years .
the doctor wants her to keep taking them but she 's stopped .
" it 's really scary .
i feel like i 've had to raise myself - it 's made me lonely and depressed . "
despite the higher number of calls from girls , official statistics show that suicide rates among 15-21-year-olds were about three times higher for males than females .
crisis point childline cymru / wales service manager jonathan green urged the welsh assembly government to give mental health urgent attention , saying there were not enough therapeutic services for children " when young people talk about suicide they are obviously in deep despair , " mr green said .
" they are at crisis point with no-one else to turn to which is why they call us .
" we are able to give immediate advice to these young people , who are going through a terrifying experience but it is clear that those who call us with serious problems many need more intensive therapeutic support over a sustained period . "
an assembly government spokesperson said they were taking action across a range of areas to ensure young people access to services .
it will shortly be consulting on a national strategy for counselling in school which aims to ensure provision is available to school pupils .
the spokesperson said they will also be strengthening child and adolescent mental health services by building a balanced range across health , education and social care services .

here is a transcript of the 45-year-old 's acceptance speech : i need a second to take it in .
i wrote something down because i thought if something happened , i would be overwhelmed - and i am .
when i was a kid , the only way i saw movies was from the back seat of my family 's car at the drive-in .
it was n't my reality to think i would be acting in movies - so receiving this honour tonight tells me it is possible .
it is possible for a kid from east texas , raised in south central la and carson , who believes in his dreams , commits himself to them with his heart , to touch them and to have them happen .
because when i first started acting , it was because of my desire to connect to everyone , to that thing inside of each of us , that light that i believe exists in all of us .
acting , for me , is believing in that connection , and it 's a connection so strong , and it 's a connection so deep , that we feel it , and through our combined belief we can create a new reality .
i want to thank my fellow believers in the last king of scotland .
i want to thank peter , jeremy , andrea , lisa , charles , kevin , james mcavoy , carrie , steven , fox , dna , channel 4 .
i want to thank the people of uganda who helped this film have a spirit .

here is a transcript of the 45-year-old 's acceptance speech : i need a second to take it in .
i wrote something down because i thought if something happened , i would be overwhelmed - and i am .
when i was a kid , the only way i saw movies was from the back seat of my family 's car at the drive-in .
it was n't my reality to think i would be acting in movies - so receiving this honour tonight tells me it is possible .
it is possible for a kid from east texas , raised in south central la and carson , who believes in his dreams , commits himself to them with his heart , to touch them and to have them happen .
because when i first started acting , it was because of my desire to connect to everyone , to that thing inside of each of us , that light that i believe exists in all of us .
acting , for me , is believing in that connection , and it 's a connection so strong , and it 's a connection so deep , that we feel it , and through our combined belief we can create a new reality .
i want to thank my fellow believers in the last king of scotland .
i want to thank peter , jeremy , andrea , lisa , charles , kevin , james mcavoy , carrie , steven , fox , dna , channel 4 .
i want to thank the people of uganda who helped this film have a spirit .
and finally , i want to thank my mum and my dad .
i want to thank my wife keisha , my children , my ancestors who continue to guide my steps , and god .
god , who believes in us all - and who has given me this moment in this lifetime that i will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime and into the next lifetime .

how did she fare in this most challenging of roles ?
before degeneres , only whoopi goldberg hosted the oscars solo wearing white shoes and an open-necked red suit , ellen degeneres may have entered the stage of kodak theatre looking relaxed .
but the face and voice of the oscars presenter suggested she was anything but .
speculation prior to the awards was that degeneres had been selected in the hope of providing a happy medium between edgy 2005 host chris rock and 2006 presenter john stewart - neither cutting nor funny enough .
as she struggled into her opening monologue , barely able to get her words out , there was a real sense of tension in the air .
indeed , the cutaways to the assembled stars ' faces showed all too clearly the genuine fear that degeneres was going to flop utterly .
they need n't have worried .
degeneres rallied magnificently with a joke about al gore being denied victory in the 2000 us presidential election .
" jennifer hudson is here - she was on american idol and america did n't vote for her , " she said .
" but then al gore is here - and america did vote for him . "
it may have been six years after the event , but the applause from the democratic-leaning crowd still took the roof off .
famous faces it was the kind of thing that had been expected from stewart last year - and which he had so noticeably failed to supply .
so how did degeneres follow this killer gag ?
by wisely keeping her subsequent appearances to a bare minimum .
at one point she appeared with an oscar in a baby carrier she had promised the night would be all about the nominees - " unlike most years , when they 're all about the winners " , she quipped .
true to that notion , hollywood 's royalty were cast in a supporting role .
it was an interesting idea .
after all , with all those stars and all that talent in one place , why not use it ?
clearly the show 's producers had realised people so famous they appear daily on magazine covers from alaska to antarctica do not need someone else to come out and introduce them .
this meant degeneres was not confined to the stage , taking pot-shots at the stars , but could instead mingle amongst them in the aisles .
rather than wisecracks , she got laughs by asking martin scorsese to read her screenplay - " it 's a cross between goodfellas and big momma 's house " - or having her photo taken with clint eastwood , by steven spielberg , for her myspace site .
and in place of some of the awful skits and long , boring montages of the last few years , there was evidence of some real thought behind this year 's routines .
one musical number , in which will ferrell and jack black sang about one of the universal truths in hollywood - that comedy acting is never acknowledged - was good enough to feature in any number of oscar-winning musicals .
' green oscars ' there was also a celebration of the great foreign-language films , corresponding to the fact that more non-us stars than ever had been nominated this year .
but that was as far as it went in terms of " message " .
she also pretended to present martin scorsese -lrb- r -rrb- with a script yes , leonardo dicaprio had a nice line of banter with al gore over whether the star of an inconvenient truth star would take the opportunity to make " a really big announcement " - a reference to speculation he may run again for the presidency .
yet gore 's proud claim that they were celebrating the first " officially green " oscars was rather undermined when the camera cut to a yawning jerry seinfeld .
seinfeld then showed up himself - ironically to present the best documentary oscar to an inconvenient truth - to offer a fully-fledged routine .
in terms of screen time , it was almost as long as degeneres ' total presentation - and a reminder , perhaps , of some of the things that were missing from her approach .
it would not be surprising if his name was added to the list of hosts before long .

how did she fare in this most challenging of roles ?
before degeneres , only whoopi goldberg hosted the oscars solo wearing white shoes and an open-necked red suit , ellen degeneres may have entered the stage of kodak theatre looking relaxed .
but the face and voice of the oscars presenter suggested she was anything but .
speculation prior to the awards was that degeneres had been selected in the hope of providing a happy medium between edgy 2005 host chris rock and 2006 presenter john stewart - neither cutting nor funny enough .
as she struggled into her opening monologue , barely able to get her words out , there was a real sense of tension in the air .
indeed , the cutaways to the assembled stars ' faces showed all too clearly the genuine fear that degeneres was going to flop utterly .
they need n't have worried .
degeneres rallied magnificently with a joke about al gore being denied victory in the 2000 us presidential election .
" jennifer hudson is here - she was on american idol and america did n't vote for her , " she said .
" but then al gore is here - and america did vote for him . "
it may have been six years after the event , but the applause from the democratic-leaning crowd still took the roof off .
famous faces it was the kind of thing that had been expected from stewart last year - and which he had so noticeably failed to supply .
so how did degeneres follow this killer gag ?
by wisely keeping her subsequent appearances to a bare minimum .
at one point she appeared with an oscar in a baby carrier she had promised the night would be all about the nominees - " unlike most years , when they 're all about the winners " , she quipped .
true to that notion , hollywood 's royalty were cast in a supporting role .
it was an interesting idea .
after all , with all those stars and all that talent in one place , why not use it ?
clearly the show 's producers had realised people so famous they appear daily on magazine covers from alaska to antarctica do not need someone else to come out and introduce them .
this meant degeneres was not confined to the stage , taking pot-shots at the stars , but could instead mingle amongst them in the aisles .
rather than wisecracks , she got laughs by asking martin scorsese to read her screenplay - " it 's a cross between goodfellas and big momma 's house " - or having her photo taken with clint eastwood , by steven spielberg , for her myspace site .
and in place of some of the awful skits and long , boring montages of the last few years , there was evidence of some real thought behind this year 's routines .
one musical number , in which will ferrell and jack black sang about one of the universal truths in hollywood - that comedy acting is never acknowledged - was good enough to feature in any number of oscar-winning musicals .
' green oscars ' there was also a celebration of the great foreign-language films , corresponding to the fact that more non-us stars than ever had been nominated this year .
but that was as far as it went in terms of " message " .
she also pretended to present martin scorsese -lrb- r -rrb- with a script yes , leonardo dicaprio had a nice line of banter with al gore over whether the star of an inconvenient truth star would take the opportunity to make " a really big announcement " - a reference to speculation he may run again for the presidency .
yet gore 's proud claim that they were celebrating the first " officially green " oscars was rather undermined when the camera cut to a yawning jerry seinfeld .
seinfeld then showed up himself - ironically to present the best documentary oscar to an inconvenient truth - to offer a fully-fledged routine .
in terms of screen time , it was almost as long as degeneres ' total presentation - and a reminder , perhaps , of some of the things that were missing from her approach .
it would not be surprising if his name was added to the list of hosts before long .

how did she fare in this most challenging of roles ?
before degeneres , only whoopi goldberg hosted the oscars solo wearing white shoes and an open-necked red suit , ellen degeneres may have entered the stage of kodak theatre looking relaxed .
but the face and voice of the oscars presenter suggested she was anything but .
speculation prior to the awards was that degeneres had been selected in the hope of providing a happy medium between edgy 2005 host chris rock and 2006 presenter john stewart - neither cutting nor funny enough .
as she struggled into her opening monologue , barely able to get her words out , there was a real sense of tension in the air .
indeed , the cutaways to the assembled stars ' faces showed all too clearly the genuine fear that degeneres was going to flop utterly .
they need n't have worried .
degeneres rallied magnificently with a joke about al gore being denied victory in the 2000 us presidential election .
" jennifer hudson is here - she was on american idol and america did n't vote for her , " she said .
" but then al gore is here - and america did vote for him . "
it may have been six years after the event , but the applause from the democratic-leaning crowd still took the roof off .
famous faces it was the kind of thing that had been expected from stewart last year - and which he had so noticeably failed to supply .
so how did degeneres follow this killer gag ?
by wisely keeping her subsequent appearances to a bare minimum .
at one point she appeared with an oscar in a baby carrier she had promised the night would be all about the nominees - " unlike most years , when they 're all about the winners " , she quipped .
true to that notion , hollywood 's royalty were cast in a supporting role .
it was an interesting idea .
after all , with all those stars and all that talent in one place , why not use it ?
clearly the show 's producers had realised people so famous they appear daily on magazine covers from alaska to antarctica do not need someone else to come out and introduce them .
this meant degeneres was not confined to the stage , taking pot-shots at the stars , but could instead mingle amongst them in the aisles .
rather than wisecracks , she got laughs by asking martin scorsese to read her screenplay - " it 's a cross between goodfellas and big momma 's house " - or having her photo taken with clint eastwood , by steven spielberg , for her myspace site .
and in place of some of the awful skits and long , boring montages of the last few years , there was evidence of some real thought behind this year 's routines .
one musical number , in which will ferrell and jack black sang about one of the universal truths in hollywood - that comedy acting is never acknowledged - was good enough to feature in any number of oscar-winning musicals .
' green oscars ' there was also a celebration of the great foreign-language films , corresponding to the fact that more non-us stars than ever had been nominated this year .
but that was as far as it went in terms of " message " .
she also pretended to present martin scorsese -lrb- r -rrb- with a script yes , leonardo dicaprio had a nice line of banter with al gore over whether the star of an inconvenient truth star would take the opportunity to make " a really big announcement " - a reference to speculation he may run again for the presidency .
yet gore 's proud claim that they were celebrating the first " officially green " oscars was rather undermined when the camera cut to a yawning jerry seinfeld .
seinfeld then showed up himself - ironically to present the best documentary oscar to an inconvenient truth - to offer a fully-fledged routine .
in terms of screen time , it was almost as long as degeneres ' total presentation - and a reminder , perhaps , of some of the things that were missing from her approach .
it would not be surprising if his name was added to the list of hosts before long .

dr rowan williams will try to prevent a split in the church over gay rights that is because the same chill wind of division that preoccupied the archbishops in tanzania will be blowing through church house in westminster .
at last week 's gathering , the leaders of the world 's 38 independent anglican churches achieved what had seemed an improbable consensus .
the communion has been in crisis since the liberal american branch of anglicanism , the episcopal church , ordained an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
before the archbishops gathered in dar es salaam , it seemed likely that the leaders of conservative anglican churches would set up some sort of alternative communion to cater for the dozens of traditionalist congregations that have broken away from the episcopal church .
that posed the communion with a dire threat .
even if this new organisation had been linked to other anglican churches , it would have provided disgruntled traditionalists in every other national church with a new model of anglicanism - and many would have eventually gravitated towards it .
but , after a tense few days in the african sun , the archbishops managed to agree a plan for a parallel church organisation in america of their own devising , safely within both the episcopal church and the communion .
buying time it is not a completely done deal .
liberal americans might reject this unprecedented interference in their territory .
they might also baulk at the demand by the rest of the communion for an unequivocal commitment not to ordain any more gay bishops or to bless same-sex relationships in church services .
but valuable time was bought and the agreement has been hailed an achievement , not least for archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , on whose personal powers of persuasion it seemed largely to depend .
the same dispute threatens to pit english congregations against each other too robert pigott does that mean that the dispute has been defused for the other 38 anglican churches , including the church of england , meeting in westminster this week ?
by no means .
the same dispute threatens to pit english congregations against each other too .
the church , which has weathered deep differences over fundamental issues such as whether to ordain women , is vulnerable to a split over homosexuality .
that is partly because it divides the church down its oldest fault-line - between its traditionalist protestant wing with its emphasis on a relatively literal interpretation of the bible on one side , and on the other , the more progressive catholic wing , which places more stress on interpreting the spirit of biblical teaching , especially on social justice .
' contrary to scripture ' the synod discussion will take place in two separate debates on wednesday .
the first seeks an acknowledgment that you can have a homosexual orientation and be a perfectly good christian .
it also suggests that the progressive attitude towards homosexuality comes from " honest and legitimate " reading of the bible .
they seem modest enough requests , but traditionalists suspect they are intended to pave the way for a change in official church policy that active homosexuality is " contrary to scripture " .
a second motion attacks what traditionalists claim was the church 's supine response to civil partnerships - especially its failure to declare them inconsistent with christian teaching , and to do more to prevent gay clergy participating in such partnerships .
in such ways the battle over sexuality is likely to continue to be played out in the church .
interpreting the bible traditionalists say it 's a question of authority - is the bible the ultimate guide to how to behave or not ?
liberals say the bible is supreme , but it 's not a telephone directory , with specific instructions as to how to behave on any situation you look up .
traditionalists say the communion becomes meaningless as a coherent christian body if its constituent parts differ on matters of fundamental importance .
liberals say it has to be fluid enough to allow parts of it that are so minded to progress , just as they have on divorce and the ordination of women priests .
the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote robert pigott the synod will open with an address by dr williams , in which he is expected to report the tanzania agreement .
for all his success in buying time to deal with the crisis , he will know how difficult it will be for the episcopal church to agree to the deal .
even if it does , the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote .
it is not only traditionalist africans who could provide an alternative model of anglicanism for disaffected english congregations .
dr williams will probably want to warn the church that it 's not out of the woods yet .

dr rowan williams will try to prevent a split in the church over gay rights that is because the same chill wind of division that preoccupied the archbishops in tanzania will be blowing through church house in westminster .
at last week 's gathering , the leaders of the world 's 38 independent anglican churches achieved what had seemed an improbable consensus .
the communion has been in crisis since the liberal american branch of anglicanism , the episcopal church , ordained an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
before the archbishops gathered in dar es salaam , it seemed likely that the leaders of conservative anglican churches would set up some sort of alternative communion to cater for the dozens of traditionalist congregations that have broken away from the episcopal church .
that posed the communion with a dire threat .
even if this new organisation had been linked to other anglican churches , it would have provided disgruntled traditionalists in every other national church with a new model of anglicanism - and many would have eventually gravitated towards it .
but , after a tense few days in the african sun , the archbishops managed to agree a plan for a parallel church organisation in america of their own devising , safely within both the episcopal church and the communion .
buying time it is not a completely done deal .
liberal americans might reject this unprecedented interference in their territory .
they might also baulk at the demand by the rest of the communion for an unequivocal commitment not to ordain any more gay bishops or to bless same-sex relationships in church services .
but valuable time was bought and the agreement has been hailed an achievement , not least for archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , on whose personal powers of persuasion it seemed largely to depend .

by no means .
the same dispute threatens to pit english congregations against each other too .
the church , which has weathered deep differences over fundamental issues such as whether to ordain women , is vulnerable to a split over homosexuality .
that is partly because it divides the church down its oldest fault-line - between its traditionalist protestant wing with its emphasis on a relatively literal interpretation of the bible on one side , and on the other , the more progressive catholic wing , which places more stress on interpreting the spirit of biblical teaching , especially on social justice .
' contrary to scripture ' the synod discussion will take place in two separate debates on wednesday .
the first seeks an acknowledgment that you can have a homosexual orientation and be a perfectly good christian .
it also suggests that the progressive attitude towards homosexuality comes from " honest and legitimate " reading of the bible .
they seem modest enough requests , but traditionalists suspect they are intended to pave the way for a change in official church policy that active homosexuality is " contrary to scripture " .
a second motion attacks what traditionalists claim was the church 's supine response to civil partnerships - especially its failure to declare them inconsistent with christian teaching , and to do more to prevent gay clergy participating in such partnerships .
in such ways the battle over sexuality is likely to continue to be played out in the church .
interpreting the bible traditionalists say it 's a question of authority - is the bible the ultimate guide to how to behave or not ?
liberals say the bible is supreme , but it 's not a telephone directory , with specific instructions as to how to behave on any situation you look up .
traditionalists say the communion becomes meaningless as a coherent christian body if its constituent parts differ on matters of fundamental importance .
liberals say it has to be fluid enough to allow parts of it that are so minded to progress , just as they have on divorce and the ordination of women priests .
the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote robert pigott the synod will open with an address by dr williams , in which he is expected to report the tanzania agreement .
for all his success in buying time to deal with the crisis , he will know how difficult it will be for the episcopal church to agree to the deal .
even if it does , the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote .
it is not only traditionalist africans who could provide an alternative model of anglicanism for disaffected english congregations .
dr williams will probably want to warn the church that it 's not out of the woods yet .

dr rowan williams will try to prevent a split in the church over gay rights that is because the same chill wind of division that preoccupied the archbishops in tanzania will be blowing through church house in westminster .
at last week 's gathering , the leaders of the world 's 38 independent anglican churches achieved what had seemed an improbable consensus .
the communion has been in crisis since the liberal american branch of anglicanism , the episcopal church , ordained an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
before the archbishops gathered in dar es salaam , it seemed likely that the leaders of conservative anglican churches would set up some sort of alternative communion to cater for the dozens of traditionalist congregations that have broken away from the episcopal church .
that posed the communion with a dire threat .
even if this new organisation had been linked to other anglican churches , it would have provided disgruntled traditionalists in every other national church with a new model of anglicanism - and many would have eventually gravitated towards it .
but , after a tense few days in the african sun , the archbishops managed to agree a plan for a parallel church organisation in america of their own devising , safely within both the episcopal church and the communion .
buying time it is not a completely done deal .
liberal americans might reject this unprecedented interference in their territory .
they might also baulk at the demand by the rest of the communion for an unequivocal commitment not to ordain any more gay bishops or to bless same-sex relationships in church services .

the same dispute threatens to pit english congregations against each other too .
the church , which has weathered deep differences over fundamental issues such as whether to ordain women , is vulnerable to a split over homosexuality .
that is partly because it divides the church down its oldest fault-line - between its traditionalist protestant wing with its emphasis on a relatively literal interpretation of the bible on one side , and on the other , the more progressive catholic wing , which places more stress on interpreting the spirit of biblical teaching , especially on social justice .

dr rowan williams will try to prevent a split in the church over gay rights that is because the same chill wind of division that preoccupied the archbishops in tanzania will be blowing through church house in westminster .
at last week 's gathering , the leaders of the world 's 38 independent anglican churches achieved what had seemed an improbable consensus .
the communion has been in crisis since the liberal american branch of anglicanism , the episcopal church , ordained an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
before the archbishops gathered in dar es salaam , it seemed likely that the leaders of conservative anglican churches would set up some sort of alternative communion to cater for the dozens of traditionalist congregations that have broken away from the episcopal church .
that posed the communion with a dire threat .
even if this new organisation had been linked to other anglican churches , it would have provided disgruntled traditionalists in every other national church with a new model of anglicanism - and many would have eventually gravitated towards it .
but , after a tense few days in the african sun , the archbishops managed to agree a plan for a parallel church organisation in america of their own devising , safely within both the episcopal church and the communion .
buying time it is not a completely done deal .
liberal americans might reject this unprecedented interference in their territory .
they might also baulk at the demand by the rest of the communion for an unequivocal commitment not to ordain any more gay bishops or to bless same-sex relationships in church services .
but valuable time was bought and the agreement has been hailed an achievement , not least for archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , on whose personal powers of persuasion it seemed largely to depend .

by no means .
the same dispute threatens to pit english congregations against each other too .
the church , which has weathered deep differences over fundamental issues such as whether to ordain women , is vulnerable to a split over homosexuality .
that is partly because it divides the church down its oldest fault-line - between its traditionalist protestant wing with its emphasis on a relatively literal interpretation of the bible on one side , and on the other , the more progressive catholic wing , which places more stress on interpreting the spirit of biblical teaching , especially on social justice .
' contrary to scripture ' the synod discussion will take place in two separate debates on wednesday .
the first seeks an acknowledgment that you can have a homosexual orientation and be a perfectly good christian .
it also suggests that the progressive attitude towards homosexuality comes from " honest and legitimate " reading of the bible .
they seem modest enough requests , but traditionalists suspect they are intended to pave the way for a change in official church policy that active homosexuality is " contrary to scripture " .
a second motion attacks what traditionalists claim was the church 's supine response to civil partnerships - especially its failure to declare them inconsistent with christian teaching , and to do more to prevent gay clergy participating in such partnerships .
in such ways the battle over sexuality is likely to continue to be played out in the church .
interpreting the bible traditionalists say it 's a question of authority - is the bible the ultimate guide to how to behave or not ?
liberals say the bible is supreme , but it 's not a telephone directory , with specific instructions as to how to behave on any situation you look up .
traditionalists say the communion becomes meaningless as a coherent christian body if its constituent parts differ on matters of fundamental importance .
liberals say it has to be fluid enough to allow parts of it that are so minded to progress , just as they have on divorce and the ordination of women priests .
the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote robert pigott the synod will open with an address by dr williams , in which he is expected to report the tanzania agreement .
for all his success in buying time to deal with the crisis , he will know how difficult it will be for the episcopal church to agree to the deal .
even if it does , the chances of a long-term promise to toe the traditionalist line on sexuality seem remote .
it is not only traditionalist africans who could provide an alternative model of anglicanism for disaffected english congregations .

the politicians from el salvador were killed on monday one was the son of arena 's late founder , roberto d 'aubuisson , who was accused of being behind the assassination of archbishop oscar arnulfo romero in 1980 .
drug links , political motives or a case of mistaken identity have all been put forward as an explanation for the politicians ' murder .
el salvador 's attorney general felix garrid safie has said the killings were almost certainly linked to organised crime .
the president of guatemala , oscar berger , apologised to el salvador and ordered an investigation into corruption in his country 's police force .
