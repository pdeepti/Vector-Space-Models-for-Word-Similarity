bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for köhler , africa has long been an important policy point " we in the northern hemisphere have to change our thinking , " said köhler , who has made fighting poverty in africa a focus of his tenure .
this was the third presidential conference on africa held by köhler , who formerly headed the international monetary fund in washington .
he urged industrial countries not to just sit by and watch as african countries face one crisis after the other .
" africa was always the object of other nations ' expansive ideas , " köhler told attendees .
he warned above all against exploiting the continent 's resources .
" to steamroll the continent once more would be a historical failure , " he said .
support for epas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe should not just sit idly by amid african crises , köhler said .
köhler argued on behalf of the controversial economic partnership agreements between europe and africa , saying they are in everyone 's best interest .
he urged african states to clarify their criticisms of the agreement plans and said the eu should create better fair-trade conditions for its african partners .
köhler also said africa should continue to develop the african union into a political entity similar to the eu , in order to prevent industrial nations ' attempts to divide the african union by signing trade deals with individual countries .
increasingly interdependent world moreover , he said , accords between individual nations are losing their meaning in a world where issues including climate change , aids , and migration mean countries are increasingly interdependent .

he urged support for controversial european-african economic accords . addressing attendees at a conference held near frankfurt , germany on sunday , köhler said industrial countries are often unfair when it comes to working out trade policy , migration issues , fishing contracts and resource usage in africa .

this was the third presidential conference on africa held by köhler , who formerly headed the international monetary fund in washington .
he urged industrial countries not to just sit by and watch as african countries face one crisis after the other .

increasingly interdependent world moreover , he said , accords between individual nations are losing their meaning in a world where issues including climate change , aids , and migration mean countries are increasingly interdependent .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .
the meat should not be wormy , pustuled or otherwise diseased , nor going rancid or moldy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , as then , the sausage has its devoted fans also disallowed in the mix of ground meats and spices , which when combined make one of germany 's most famous street snacks , are " appendix , heart , kidney " as well as " any other dangerous or foreign meat . " wurst trivia anyone caught stuffing undesirables into his several meters of gut casing risked being fined " two current shillings -lrb- 24 pfennigs -rrb- " per offending wiener . experts say it is hard to know just how serious a penalty that would have been at the time , although information available at the first german bratwurst museum , near the eastern german town of erfurt , implies it was probably not ruinous , and could be equivalent to a day 's wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe : the majoram made him do it meanwhile , the unearthed recipe has taken pride of place among the other fascinating bits of bratwurst history on view at the bratwurst museum . these include the notation that a certain hans stromer ate 28,000 wursts between 1517 and 1592 while locked up in jail ; a record of a 670-meter -lrb- nearly half a mile -rrb- long bratwurst made in 1600 ; and the fact that in 1800 , goethe was so impressed by some " deliciously prepared " thuringer bratwurst made with marjoram , that he mailed some from nuremberg to all the way home to weimar . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .
it is a reconstruction of a nazi propaganda exhibit from 1938 , which had condemned works by celebrated composers like paul hindemith , arnold schoenberg , igor stravinsky and kurt weill . in a symbolic gesture , stravinsky 's " le sacre du printemps " was performed the philharmonic and rattle on sunday evening at the conclusion of the anniversary concert . looking forward - musically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle has headed the philharmonic since 2002 under rattle 's direction , the berlin philharmonic has been changing its staunch traditionalist image as a bearer of german musical tradition . " it 's no longer the glamorous diva at the edge of the city , " rattle told the german dpa news agency .
" an orchestra ca n't just live in the past , it has to look forward . " the conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the german orchestral tradition - both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience . he has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .
it is a reconstruction of a nazi propaganda exhibit from 1938 , which had condemned works by celebrated composers like paul hindemith , arnold schoenberg , igor stravinsky and kurt weill . in a symbolic gesture , stravinsky 's " le sacre du printemps " was performed the philharmonic and rattle on sunday evening at the conclusion of the anniversary concert . looking forward - musically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle has headed the philharmonic since 2002 under rattle 's direction , the berlin philharmonic has been changing its staunch traditionalist image as a bearer of german musical tradition . " it 's no longer the glamorous diva at the edge of the city , " rattle told the german dpa news agency .
" an orchestra ca n't just live in the past , it has to look forward . " the conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the german orchestral tradition - both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience . he has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .

he urged support for controversial european-african economic accords . addressing attendees at a conference held near frankfurt , germany on sunday , köhler said industrial countries are often unfair when it comes to working out trade policy , migration issues , fishing contracts and resource usage in africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for köhler , africa has long been an important policy point " we in the northern hemisphere have to change our thinking , " said köhler , who has made fighting poverty in africa a focus of his tenure .
this was the third presidential conference on africa held by köhler , who formerly headed the international monetary fund in washington .
he urged industrial countries not to just sit by and watch as african countries face one crisis after the other .
" africa was always the object of other nations ' expansive ideas , " köhler told attendees .
he warned above all against exploiting the continent 's resources .
" to steamroll the continent once more would be a historical failure , " he said .
support for epas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe should not just sit idly by amid african crises , köhler said .
köhler argued on behalf of the controversial economic partnership agreements between europe and africa , saying they are in everyone 's best interest .
he urged african states to clarify their criticisms of the agreement plans and said the eu should create better fair-trade conditions for its african partners .
köhler also said africa should continue to develop the african union into a political entity similar to the eu , in order to prevent industrial nations ' attempts to divide the african union by signing trade deals with individual countries .

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .
the meat should not be wormy , pustuled or otherwise diseased , nor going rancid or moldy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , as then , the sausage has its devoted fans also disallowed in the mix of ground meats and spices , which when combined make one of germany 's most famous street snacks , are " appendix , heart , kidney " as well as " any other dangerous or foreign meat .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .

" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .
it is a reconstruction of a nazi propaganda exhibit from 1938 , which had condemned works by celebrated composers like paul hindemith , arnold schoenberg , igor stravinsky and kurt weill . in a symbolic gesture , stravinsky 's " le sacre du printemps " was performed the philharmonic and rattle on sunday evening at the conclusion of the anniversary concert . looking forward - musically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle has headed the philharmonic since 2002 under rattle 's direction , the berlin philharmonic has been changing its staunch traditionalist image as a bearer of german musical tradition . " it 's no longer the glamorous diva at the edge of the city , " rattle told the german dpa news agency .
" an orchestra ca n't just live in the past , it has to look forward . " the conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the german orchestral tradition - both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience . he has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience .

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .
the meat should not be wormy , pustuled or otherwise diseased , nor going rancid or moldy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , as then , the sausage has its devoted fans also disallowed in the mix of ground meats and spices , which when combined make one of germany 's most famous street snacks , are " appendix , heart , kidney " as well as " any other dangerous or foreign meat . " wurst trivia anyone caught stuffing undesirables into his several meters of gut casing risked being fined " two current shillings -lrb- 24 pfennigs -rrb- " per offending wiener . experts say it is hard to know just how serious a penalty that would have been at the time , although information available at the first german bratwurst museum , near the eastern german town of erfurt , implies it was probably not ruinous , and could be equivalent to a day 's wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe : the majoram made him do it meanwhile , the unearthed recipe has taken pride of place among the other fascinating bits of bratwurst history on view at the bratwurst museum . these include the notation that a certain hans stromer ate 28,000 wursts between 1517 and 1592 while locked up in jail ; a record of a 670-meter -lrb- nearly half a mile -rrb- long bratwurst made in 1600 ; and the fact that in 1800 , goethe was so impressed by some " deliciously prepared " thuringer bratwurst made with marjoram , that he mailed some from nuremberg to all the way home to weimar . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .
it is a reconstruction of a nazi propaganda exhibit from 1938 , which had condemned works by celebrated composers like paul hindemith , arnold schoenberg , igor stravinsky and kurt weill . in a symbolic gesture , stravinsky 's " le sacre du printemps " was performed the philharmonic and rattle on sunday evening at the conclusion of the anniversary concert . looking forward - musically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle has headed the philharmonic since 2002 under rattle 's direction , the berlin philharmonic has been changing its staunch traditionalist image as a bearer of german musical tradition . " it 's no longer the glamorous diva at the edge of the city , " rattle told the german dpa news agency .
" an orchestra ca n't just live in the past , it has to look forward . " the conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the german orchestral tradition - both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience . he has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .

friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations .

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he urged industrial countries not to just sit by and watch as african countries face one crisis after the other .

köhler also said africa should continue to develop the african union into a political entity similar to the eu , in order to prevent industrial nations ' attempts to divide the african union by signing trade deals with individual countries .

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for köhler , africa has long been an important policy point " we in the northern hemisphere have to change our thinking , " said köhler , who has made fighting poverty in africa a focus of his tenure .
this was the third presidential conference on africa held by köhler , who formerly headed the international monetary fund in washington .
he urged industrial countries not to just sit by and watch as african countries face one crisis after the other .
" africa was always the object of other nations ' expansive ideas , " köhler told attendees .
he warned above all against exploiting the continent 's resources .
" to steamroll the continent once more would be a historical failure , " he said .

he urged african states to clarify their criticisms of the agreement plans and said the eu should create better fair-trade conditions for its african partners .
köhler also said africa should continue to develop the african union into a political entity similar to the eu , in order to prevent industrial nations ' attempts to divide the african union by signing trade deals with individual countries .

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .
the meat should not be wormy , pustuled or otherwise diseased , nor going rancid or moldy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , as then , the sausage has its devoted fans also disallowed in the mix of ground meats and spices , which when combined make one of germany 's most famous street snacks , are " appendix , heart , kidney " as well as " any other dangerous or foreign meat . " wurst trivia anyone caught stuffing undesirables into his several meters of gut casing risked being fined " two current shillings -lrb- 24 pfennigs -rrb- " per offending wiener . experts say it is hard to know just how serious a penalty that would have been at the time , although information available at the first german bratwurst museum , near the eastern german town of erfurt , implies it was probably not ruinous , and could be equivalent to a day 's wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe : the majoram made him do it meanwhile , the unearthed recipe has taken pride of place among the other fascinating bits of bratwurst history on view at the bratwurst museum . these include the notation that a certain hans stromer ate 28,000 wursts between 1517 and 1592 while locked up in jail ; a record of a 670-meter -lrb- nearly half a mile -rrb- long bratwurst made in 1600 ; and the fact that in 1800 , goethe was so impressed by some " deliciously prepared " thuringer bratwurst made with marjoram , that he mailed some from nuremberg to all the way home to weimar . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the magazine report , based on an investigation carried out last year by the eu 's competition office , said that e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall has been acting like a cartel for years , suppressing competition in the energy market . the directors of the four companies , which control about 80 percent of germany 's electricity market , are said to have held secret meetings with each other where they discussed corporate information and made agreements on strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat is thought to have been a part of the secret meetings the eu report said germany 's biggest energy provider , e.on , had tried to " substantially influence " electricity prices . the gas sector has also been a target of anti-competition probes .
in brussels on monday , nov .
5 , the eu commission opened proceedings against rwe , italy 's eni as well as e.on and gaz de france because of unfair competition practices . an oecd report from 2006 , entitled " sustained competition is absent in energy markets , " found that the liberalization of energy markets in 1998 did not result in sustained reductions in prices .
the report said that pre-tax retail prices for gas and electricity in germany are among the highest in the eu , especially for small business and private customers . raids in 2006 the information in the spiegel article is based on the results of an investigation conducted by the eu 's antitrust office , headed by nellie kroes .
in may , june and december 2006 , investigators conducted surprise inspections of germany 's biggest energy players .
they confiscated files and computers and made copies of meeting minutes , strategy proposals and internal e-mails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu antitrust chief kroes is n't afraid of the big guys - microsoft and now germany 's energy giants while the probe is not yet complete , the 60,000 pages of compiled documentation have painted investigators an increasing sharper picture of a group of german energy giants which appear to have contravened competition and anti-trust laws for a period covering 2003 to 2006 . " instead of competing with each other , the four big suppliers agreed on strategies , prices and supply regions with the consent , or even at the orders of the bosses , " the eu report said . the cooperation appeared to have worked so well , the report added , that the invitation list to the secret meetings was expanded to include members of other european energy companies , including firms from belgium , france and italy . strong denials for their part , the energy concerns have vehemently denied the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy market liberalization has not brought prices down substantially in germany " e.on has at no time and in no fashion manipulated electricity prices or held conversations with competitors that could limit competition in the electricity and gas markets , " said the company in a statement . germany 's number two energy supplier , rwe , rejected the report 's conclusions , saying that all the documents that had been confiscated by the eu antitrust office had been carefully analyzed by external lawyers . " in the process , no improper agreements violating antitrust rules could be identified , " the company said . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded a close review of the accusations .
speaking monday morning in berlin , he said it was up to antitrust officials to carry out the review . he said politicians could only encourage more competition in the energy sector and he called on consumers to carefully check their energy bills and consider switching providers . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were there to watch legendary british conductor sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's music director since 2002 . many also came , however , the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra 's history , as the berlin philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its nazi ties . hitler 's orchestra one of the last major german institutions to do so , the philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film , an exhibition on " degenerate " music during the third reich and a book detailing the orchestra 's operations in nazi germany . as the national reichsorchester , the ensemble regularly performed for hitler 's birthday under director wilhelm furtwängler .
it was the only active orchestra during the war , and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them . facing up to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furtwängler is seen here conducting the berlin philharmonic in london in 1948 both the film and the book by misha aster , available in english under the title " the berlin philharmonic and the third reich , " take closely examine the orchestra 's role in nazi propaganda and its activities as nazi germany 's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945 . " the solution offered by goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy , " aster wrote of a deal crafted by joesph goebbels , the head of nazi propaganda .
" that naturally meant a major compromise . " part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra 's role under national socialism , said aster , appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor herbert von karajan , a former nazi party member . but since karajan 's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41 . the exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the third reich , either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to jews .

" an orchestra ca n't just live in the past , it has to look forward . " the conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the german orchestral tradition - both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience . he has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

as protests and arrests ensued in islamabad , europe 's papers were critical of both the general and the us . " gen. musharraf has called washington and london 's bluff , knowing that have no option but to back him , " wrote the guardian from the british capital on monday .
" in launching what is , in effect , his second military coup in eight years , the general has exposed the impotence of the us and britain to control a key ally with nuclear weapons . "
the general also dealt a blow to washington 's plan to stage the comeback of former prime minister benazir bhutto , whose denunciation of musharraf 's " mini-martial law " was criticized for being " ritualistic , " added the paper . writing from rome on monday , la repubblica was also critical of the us ' foreign policy , particularly its financial contributions .
" -lsb- condoleezza -rsb- rice announced yesterday -lrb- nov .
4 -rrb- that the us would review the aid it has been sending to pakistan , but it does n't look as if the us wants to end its military support in islamabad , " commented the paper .
" since 2001 , musharraf has received nearly $ 11 billion from washington and $ 150 million continue to flow in each month .
of this , only 10 percent goes to economic and social projects .
the rest goes to the soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf is both president and head of the military in pakistan " in islamabad , the house of cards of democracy and stability , which washington had built up around pervez musharraf , has collapsed , " commented germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday .
" despite the pile of rubble , washington is continuing to act as if pakistan were a bastion against islamo-fascism .
those who are disappointed about the state of emergency have n't thought of cutting off financial support to musharraf , " added the paper . " calling a state of emergency was -lsb- musharraf 's -rsb- last effort to try to prevent his public demise , " wrote switzerland 's basler zeitung on monday .
though the move wo n't save him , suspending parliamentary elections may win him time for further negotiations , commented the paper : " but his unrestricted rule is coming to an end .
it remains to be seen whether this is a chance for pakistan or if it will throw the country into even more chaos . " in a commentary on sunday , berlin 's die tageszeitung also predicted that an end to musharraf 's rule was in sight .
" like many dictators , the general is becoming the victim of his own hubris by equating his personal power with state interests , " wrote the paper .
" as if he did n't have his hands full with the threatened front of islamic fundamentalism , he 's now making even more enemies .
it 's just a matter of time before his most powerful prop , the army , realizes that their interests and those of its commander-in-chief are n't necessarily the same .

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is sarkozy 's first official trip to the us .
the two leaders were expected to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of the marquis de lafayette , the french soldier and diplomat who played a key role in the american revolution . merkel was to get an even juicier diplomatic plum , arriving friday for a weekend stay at bush 's beloved " prairie chapel " ranch in texas , a prize reserved for especially close allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents bush and sarkozy have met before , but in a casual setting merkel moved swiftly to mend ties that had deteriorated between bush and her predecessor , gerhard schröder , when she took power two years ago .
but us diplomats say small differences have started to emerge on issues ranging from iran 's nuclear program to afghanistan and kosovo , where merkel 's cautious , consensual approach has begun to grate in washington . bush and his guests will have a full diplomatic plate : " iraq , lebanon , syria , middle east peace process , kosovo , burma , afghanistan and darfur , trade , nato , transatlantic relations , climate and energy security " are also on the menu , according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe . but the issues of iran - which denies us charges that it seeks nuclear weapons and has bucked international pressure to freeze uranium enrichment - and russia - including moscow 's relations with tehran and its cloudy political future - will dominate . russia and iran worries us officials worry that term-limited russian president vladimir putin , who has suggested he may become prime minister after stepping down next year , is backing away from democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia and where it 's headed will be a topic of discussion bush , who spoke to putin by telephone two weeks ago , " wants to hear from both sarkozy and merkel about their recent meetings with putin , and how they think things are developing with our russian friends , " said johndroe . the us president , who recently imposed new us sanctions on iran , wants the un security council to approve a third round of its own punitive measures and needs france - a permanent council member - and germany to be on board . us officials say bush hopes that russia , angry at washington over plans to deploy a missile defense system in its eastern european backyard , will not oppose such a move . the head of the un atomic watchdog agency , mohamed elbaradei , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana are due to report back on iran 's nuclear program in november , said johndroe . " if their reports are not positive , then we are headed to a third sanctions regime , " he said , adding that " any discussion of issues before the un security council is going to lead to ' where does russia stand ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while not actually summits on iran , that country is high on the agenda johndroe warned against characterizing this week 's two meetings as summits on iran , but said the issue of the islamic republic 's suspect atomic drive " will get its fair share of attention . " the meetings also highlight the evolving relationship between the bush administration and france and germany , which fiercely opposed the march 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , but have since changed leaders . on good terms , so far bush and merkel " have a very good rapport , " johndroe said .
" they get along quite well .
they speak to each other very honestly and openly , and that enables them to solve problems . " bush and sarkozy have also " been getting along quite well , " he added . " they see eye to eye on the need for france and the united states to be have good relations .
friends can , of course , disagree . " as for critics who say sarkozy is overly pro-american , " it 's very fashionable to be anti-american , so it 's not surprising that some would say that , " johndroe said .
" but at the end of the day , there is a strong desire -lrb- in france -rrb- to have solid relations . " sarkozy 's advisors say the french leader knows the risks he is running being so friendly with an unpopular us president . in paris , opposition socialists have sought to portray sarkozy as a " bush poodle , " a sobriquet once reserved for former british prime minister tony blair . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they describe what should go into a sausage - and what most definitely should not . only " pure , fresh meat " should be used , according to the recipe , which is written in an early form of german .
the meat should not be wormy , pustuled or otherwise diseased , nor going rancid or moldy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , as then , the sausage has its devoted fans also disallowed in the mix of ground meats and spices , which when combined make one of germany 's most famous street snacks , are " appendix , heart , kidney " as well as " any other dangerous or foreign meat . " wurst trivia anyone caught stuffing undesirables into his several meters of gut casing risked being fined " two current shillings -lrb- 24 pfennigs -rrb- " per offending wiener . experts say it is hard to know just how serious a penalty that would have been at the time , although information available at the first german bratwurst museum , near the eastern german town of erfurt , implies it was probably not ruinous , and could be equivalent to a day 's wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe : the majoram made him do it meanwhile , the unearthed recipe has taken pride of place among the other fascinating bits of bratwurst history on view at the bratwurst museum . these include the notation that a certain hans stromer ate 28,000 wursts between 1517 and 1592 while locked up in jail ; a record of a 670-meter -lrb- nearly half a mile -rrb- long bratwurst made in 1600 ; and the fact that in 1800 , goethe was so impressed by some " deliciously prepared " thuringer bratwurst made with marjoram , that he mailed some from nuremberg to all the way home to weimar . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the potential for economic regeneration in east london and the thames gateway thanks to hs1 , estimated to be £ 10bn , was a key factor in london 's bid to host the 2012 olympics .
high speed rail the new route will cut journey times to paris by 20 minutes to two hours and 15 minutes and to brussels by 25 minutes to one hour and 51 minutes .
and with the paint barely dry on st pancras 's iron arches , the rail industry is clamouring for high speed rail to be extended throughout the uk .

planned improvements include replacing 3km -lrb- 1.8m -rrb- of track and building a new electrical sub-station in fleetwood .
blackpool council has said the £ 11.8m works , funded by the department for transport , will make tram rides quieter and smoother for passengers .
historical tramway councillor maxine callow said : " our aim is to carry out this work with the least possible disruption and i would ask our tourism colleagues and those who use the tram to bear with us .
" the council apologises for any inconvenience and reassures local residents and businesses that this really is essential work .
" we are starting the work as soon the lights are switched off to ensure that it is all finished by easter . "
blackpool 's tram system was the country 's first permanent electric street tramway .
it opened on 29 september 1885 and ran from cocker street to south shore .
a replacement bus service will be in place and zone cards and metro saver tickets will be valid on this route .

historical tramway councillor maxine callow said : " our aim is to carry out this work with the least possible disruption and i would ask our tourism colleagues and those who use the tram to bear with us .
" the council apologises for any inconvenience and reassures local residents and businesses that this really is essential work .
" we are starting the work as soon the lights are switched off to ensure that it is all finished by easter . "
blackpool 's tram system was the country 's first permanent electric street tramway .
it opened on 29 september 1885 and ran from cocker street to south shore .
a replacement bus service will be in place and zone cards and metro saver tickets will be valid on this route .

this could destabilise the us housing market and may also lead to further turmoil in financial institutions , who collectively own $ 1 trillion -lrb- £ 480.6bn -rrb- worth of sub-prime debt .
cleveland , ohio , is an industrial city on the banks of lake erie in the us " rust belt " .
it is the sub-prime capital of the united states .
one in ten homes in the city is now vacant , and whole neighbourhoods have been blighted by foreclosed , vandalized and boarded-up homes . "
families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods " michael j calhoun center for responsible lending many of these homes are now owned by the banks and investment pools owning the mortgages , and the company making the most foreclosures in cleveland is deutsche bank trust , which acts on behalf of such investment pools .
cleveland is facing a rising crime wave , and the cost of demolishing the vacant houses alone will cost the city $ 100m of its tax base .
according to jim rokakis , the county treasurer for cleveland 's cuyahoga county , " wall street strategies that made the cycle of no-money-down , no-questions-asked lending possible have sucked the life out of my city " .
sub-prime crisis growing sub-prime lending is spreading across the united states , especially in the booming housing markets of southern california , florida , washington , dc , and new york city .
one in five us mortgages now falls in this category .
as the credit crunch continues to bite " families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods , " says michael calhoun of the center for responsible lending , which tracks these issues .
sub-prime mortgages carry a much higher risk of default by the borrower than other kinds of mortgage lending .
that is because most of them are " balloon " mortgages -lrb- technically known as hybrid-adjustable rate mortgages , or arms -rrb- , which offer the borrower a fixed-rate loan for two or three years , and then switch to a much higher adjustable rate after that .
have your say " everyone is going to feel this credit crunch to some extent " turned worm send us your comments many of them are set to switch in the next two years , leaving borrowers unable to afford the higher payments .
there have already been 1.7 million foreclosure proceedings in the us in the first eight months of 2007 , and up to 2 million families are expected to lose their homes over the next two years , according to estimates by the us congress 's joint economic committee .
crisis origins but why have so many people in the us taken out sub-prime mortgages ?
the sub-prime lending market started as a way of lending to people with poor credit history - as long as they had collateral like a house that could be used to guarantee the loan .
it was particularly prevalent in inner-city areas , especially among black and hispanic borrowers .
many of these mortgages were sold by unscrupulous and little regulated mortgage brokers , who received handsome commissions for selling expensive and unsuitable products .
some customers were not told that their interest rates would go up sharply after two years ; others were promised they could refinance their home before higher rates took effect .
others found that when they had difficulties paying , huge unexplained fees were added to their bills , putting them further in debt .
marion 's story one person hard hit is marion gardner , who lives in one of the worst affected sub-prime lending areas of cleveland , known as slavic village .
a single parent , she had worked hard to buy a house where she could raise her two children and escape from the misery of the inner-city housing projects .
two years ago marion fell ill , and found she could not manage the stairs in her house .
she decided to refinance her home , using some of the money to buy an apartment where she could more easily manage .
she gave her old house to her two sons , expecting they would contribute to paying for the property she had struggled so hard to obtain .
but the sons fell behind in their payments .
marion went to her lender - countrywide , the biggest sub-prime lender in the us - and offered to pay off all the arrears .
she said they accepted her offer , and began sending them $ 1,000 every month , using up her retirement savings .
but after six months she discovered that instead of clearing her arrears , her home was going to be foreclosed by countrywide .
she still visits the house every day , trying to protect if from drug dealers and burglars , and leaves her dog in the backyard .
but she can see all along her street dozens of foreclosed properties that have been vandalised , boarded up , or gutted .
now she has learned that a date has been set for the sheriff to come and evict her .
deceptive practices ?
mark seifert , the director of the east side organising project -lrb- esop -rrb- in cleveland , which has played a leading role in helping people affected by the sub-prime crisis , says marion 's story is typical .
sub-prime crisis series special reports on why bad us home loans are affecting us all friday : us housing crash monday : financial meltdown viewers hit by sub-prime crisis speak out have your say : what should we do about the crisis ?
he says lenders engaged in deceptive practices and clients found it difficult to get any information at all when they got into arrears .
mr seifert says that esop - using protest tactics - has managed to get a few mortgage companies to sign a deal agreeing a uniform set of criteria to decide whether someone 's mortgage qualifies for renegotiation rather than foreclosure .
but he says they have been unable to reach such an agreement with countrywide , the nation 's largest sub-prime lender - although its boss has promised to meet them .
spreading to the suburbs the crisis has spread beyond the inner city to the suburbs of cleveland .
last month over 200 people turned up at a church meeting to seek esop 's help in avoiding foreclosure .
some , such as ron todd , who lives in a suburb just south of the city , are in danger of losing their home after being made redundant by northwest airlines , a big local employer .
others are worried that their neighbourhoods - and the property values of their own houses - will be ruined by the foreclosures all around them .
according to claudia coulton , co-director of the centre for urban poverty at case western reserve university in cleveland , over 10,000 families - one in eight of all owner occupiers in cleveland - will face eviction this year - and the number is expected to rise .
she says the crisis is threatening to " overwhelm the government agencies and community organisations that address the problem " .
nationwide problem cleveland 's situation is not unique .
all around the country , aid agencies report a " tidal wave " of foreclosure cases , says sarah gerecke , director of new york city 's neighborhood housing services .
predatory lending practices ninja loans : no income , no job , no assets 2/28 : mortgages that change from a fixed to a much higher adjustable rate after first two years prepayment penalties : high fees for trying to change terms of mortgage she now employs six people full-time to provide mortgage debt counselling , up from one just two years ago , and could use another 12 .
her concern is that many recently regenerated neighbourhoods in new york will soon be blighted by crisis again .
some people argue that the sub-prime lending crisis has been caused by irresponsible borrowers who lied about their income to cash in on the housing boom .
ms gerecke disagrees .
she says few of her clients would knowingly put their home at risk .
many sub-prime borrowers report that mortgage brokers misrepresented the kind of mortgage they were being offered , their annual income , and even the value of their home .
working together ?
president george w bush 's administration wants to solve the foreclosure crisis by getting lenders and borrowers to renegotiate the terms of loans . "
there is a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works " robert steel us treasury under secretary for domestic finance read the full interview it is pledging more money for advice services , and has been urging key lenders to take a more sympathetic approach .
robert steel , the us treasury under secretary for domestic finance , told the bbc that the government 's role was " to ensure that lenders and servicers are being flexible with regard to working with borrowers " .
he added that no policy could eliminate foreclosures altogether because there was " a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works . "
but according to mark zandi , chief economist for moody 's , only 1 % of sub-prime mortgages have been renegotiated rather than foreclosed so far .
ms gerecke says a piecemeal approach involving millions of individual renegotiations will not work .
each case takes hours of negotiations , and the mortgage companies ' loan loss departments are overwhelmed by the crisis .
a way out ?
the only way out , says ms gerecke , would be national loan terms agreed for the whole industry .
one such plan has been proposed by sheila bair , head of the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , one of the key banking regulators .
she told the bbc that sub-prime interest rates should not be reset if the borrower has kept up all payments and is not in arrears .
but such a deal is proving extremely difficult to reach , given that thousands of investors around the world own a share of these sub-prime mortgages .
meanwhile marion still sits in her cleveland home every day , trying to stop it being vandalised even though she knows it is merely a matter of time before she will be evicted .
" i am just really working for the banks now , protecting their property from damage , " she says .

working together ?
president george w bush 's administration wants to solve the foreclosure crisis by getting lenders and borrowers to renegotiate the terms of loans .
there is a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works robert steel us treasury under secretary for domestic finance read the full interview it is pledging more money for advice services , and has been urging key lenders to take a more sympathetic approach .
robert steel , the us treasury under secretary for domestic finance , told the bbc that the government 's role was " to ensure that lenders and servicers are being flexible with regard to working with borrowers " .
he added that no policy could eliminate foreclosures altogether because there was " a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works . "
but according to mark zandi , chief economist for moody 's , only 1 % of sub-prime mortgages have been renegotiated rather than foreclosed so far .
ms gerecke says a piecemeal approach involving millions of individual renegotiations will not work .
each case takes hours of negotiations , and the mortgage companies ' loan loss departments are overwhelmed by the crisis .
a way out ?
the only way out , says ms gerecke , would be national loan terms agreed for the whole industry .
one such plan has been proposed by sheila bair , head of the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , one of the key banking regulators .
she told the bbc that sub-prime interest rates should not be reset if the borrower has kept up all payments and is not in arrears .
but such a deal is proving extremely difficult to reach , given that thousands of investors around the world own a share of these sub-prime mortgages .
meanwhile marion still sits in her cleveland home every day , trying to stop it being vandalised even though she knows it is merely a matter of time before she will be evicted .
" i am just really working for the banks now , protecting their property from damage , " she says .

this could destabilise the us housing market and may also lead to further turmoil in financial institutions , who collectively own $ 1 trillion -lrb- £ 480.6bn -rrb- worth of sub-prime debt .
cleveland , ohio , is an industrial city on the banks of lake erie in the us " rust belt " .
it is the sub-prime capital of the united states .

cleveland is facing a rising crime wave , and the cost of demolishing the vacant houses alone will cost the city $ 100m of its tax base .
according to jim rokakis , the county treasurer for cleveland 's cuyahoga county , " wall street strategies that made the cycle of no-money-down , no-questions-asked lending possible have sucked the life out of my city " .
the sub-prime crisis in cleveland sub-prime lending black areas foreclosures -lrb- repossessions -rrb- deutsche bank properties sub-prime crisis growing sub-prime lending is spreading across the united states , especially in the booming housing markets of southern california , florida , washington , dc , and new york city .
one in five us mortgages now falls in this category .
as the credit crunch continues to bite " families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods , " says michael calhoun of the center for responsible lending , which tracks these issues .
sub-prime mortgages carry a much higher risk of default by the borrower than other kinds of mortgage lending .
that is because most of them are " balloon " mortgages -lrb- technically known as hybrid-adjustable rate mortgages , or arms -rrb- , which offer the borrower a fixed-rate loan for two or three years , and then switch to a much higher adjustable rate after that .
have your say everyone is going to feel this credit crunch to some extent turned worm send us your comments many of them are set to switch in the next two years , leaving borrowers unable to afford the higher payments .
there have already been 1.7 million foreclosure proceedings in the us in the first eight months of 2007 , and up to 2 million families are expected to lose their homes over the next two years , according to estimates by the us congress 's joint economic committee .
crisis origins but why have so many people in the us taken out sub-prime mortgages ?
the sub-prime lending market started as a way of lending to people with poor credit history - as long as they had collateral like a house that could be used to guarantee the loan .
it was particularly prevalent in inner-city areas , especially among black and hispanic borrowers .
many of these mortgages were sold by unscrupulous and little regulated mortgage brokers , who received handsome commissions for selling expensive and unsuitable products .
some customers were not told that their interest rates would go up sharply after two years ; others were promised they could refinance their home before higher rates took effect .
others found that when they had difficulties paying , huge unexplained fees were added to their bills , putting them further in debt .
marion 's story one person hard hit is marion gardner , who lives in one of the worst affected sub-prime lending areas of cleveland , known as slavic village .
marion has spent 30 years raising a family in her home a single parent , she had worked hard to buy a house where she could raise her two children and escape from the misery of the inner-city housing projects .
two years ago marion fell ill , and found she could not manage the stairs in her house .
she decided to refinance her home , using some of the money to buy an apartment where she could more easily manage .
she gave her old house to her two sons , expecting they would contribute to paying for the property she had struggled so hard to obtain .
but the sons fell behind in their payments .
marion went to her lender - countrywide , the biggest sub-prime lender in the us - and offered to pay off all the arrears .
she said they accepted her offer , and began sending them $ 1,000 every month , using up her retirement savings .
but after six months she discovered that instead of clearing her arrears , her home was going to be foreclosed by countrywide .
she still visits the house every day , trying to protect if from drug dealers and burglars , and leaves her dog in the backyard .
but she can see all along her street dozens of foreclosed properties that have been vandalised , boarded up , or gutted .
now she has learned that a date has been set for the sheriff to come and evict her .
deceptive practices ?
mark seifert , the director of the east side organising project -lrb- esop -rrb- in cleveland , which has played a leading role in helping people affected by the sub-prime crisis , says marion 's story is typical .
sub-prime crisis series special reports on why bad us home loans are affecting us all friday : us housing crash monday : financial meltdown viewers hit by sub-prime crisis speak out have your say : what should we do about the crisis ?
he says lenders engaged in deceptive practices and clients found it difficult to get any information at all when they got into arrears .
mr seifert says that esop - using protest tactics - has managed to get a few mortgage companies to sign a deal agreeing a uniform set of criteria to decide whether someone 's mortgage qualifies for renegotiation rather than foreclosure .
but he says they have been unable to reach such an agreement with countrywide , the nation 's largest sub-prime lender - although its boss has promised to meet them .
spreading to the suburbs the crisis has spread beyond the inner city to the suburbs of cleveland .
last month over 200 people turned up at a church meeting to seek esop 's help in avoiding foreclosure .
worried homeowners meet to " save the american dream " some , such as ron todd , who lives in a suburb just south of the city , are in danger of losing their home after being made redundant by northwest airlines , a big local employer .
others are worried that their neighbourhoods - and the property values of their own houses - will be ruined by the foreclosures all around them .
according to claudia coulton , co-director of the centre for urban poverty at case western reserve university in cleveland , over 10,000 families - one in eight of all owner occupiers in cleveland - will face eviction this year - and the number is expected to rise .
she says the crisis is threatening to " overwhelm the government agencies and community organisations that address the problem " .
nationwide problem cleveland 's situation is not unique .
all around the country , aid agencies report a " tidal wave " of foreclosure cases , says sarah gerecke , director of new york city 's neighborhood housing services .

one in five us mortgages now falls in this category .
as the credit crunch continues to bite " families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods , " says michael calhoun of the center for responsible lending , which tracks these issues .
sub-prime mortgages carry a much higher risk of default by the borrower than other kinds of mortgage lending .
that is because most of them are " balloon " mortgages -lrb- technically known as hybrid-adjustable rate mortgages , or arms -rrb- , which offer the borrower a fixed-rate loan for two or three years , and then switch to a much higher adjustable rate after that .

there have already been 1.7 million foreclosure proceedings in the us in the first eight months of 2007 , and up to 2 million families are expected to lose their homes over the next two years , according to estimates by the us congress 's joint economic committee .
crisis origins but why have so many people in the us taken out sub-prime mortgages ?
the sub-prime lending market started as a way of lending to people with poor credit history - as long as they had collateral like a house that could be used to guarantee the loan .
it was particularly prevalent in inner-city areas , especially among black and hispanic borrowers .
many of these mortgages were sold by unscrupulous and little regulated mortgage brokers , who received handsome commissions for selling expensive and unsuitable products .
some customers were not told that their interest rates would go up sharply after two years ; others were promised they could refinance their home before higher rates took effect .
others found that when they had difficulties paying , huge unexplained fees were added to their bills , putting them further in debt .
marion 's story one person hard hit is marion gardner , who lives in one of the worst affected sub-prime lending areas of cleveland , known as slavic village .
marion has spent 30 years raising a family in her home a single parent , she had worked hard to buy a house where she could raise her two children and escape from the misery of the inner-city housing projects .
two years ago marion fell ill , and found she could not manage the stairs in her house .
she decided to refinance her home , using some of the money to buy an apartment where she could more easily manage .
she gave her old house to her two sons , expecting they would contribute to paying for the property she had struggled so hard to obtain .
but the sons fell behind in their payments .
marion went to her lender - countrywide , the biggest sub-prime lender in the us - and offered to pay off all the arrears .
she said they accepted her offer , and began sending them $ 1,000 every month , using up her retirement savings .
but after six months she discovered that instead of clearing her arrears , her home was going to be foreclosed by countrywide .
she still visits the house every day , trying to protect if from drug dealers and burglars , and leaves her dog in the backyard .
but she can see all along her street dozens of foreclosed properties that have been vandalised , boarded up , or gutted .
now she has learned that a date has been set for the sheriff to come and evict her .
deceptive practices ?
mark seifert , the director of the east side organising project -lrb- esop -rrb- in cleveland , which has played a leading role in helping people affected by the sub-prime crisis , says marion 's story is typical .
sub-prime crisis series special reports on why bad us home loans are affecting us all friday : us housing crash monday : financial meltdown viewers hit by sub-prime crisis speak out have your say : what should we do about the crisis ?
he says lenders engaged in deceptive practices and clients found it difficult to get any information at all when they got into arrears .
mr seifert says that esop - using protest tactics - has managed to get a few mortgage companies to sign a deal agreeing a uniform set of criteria to decide whether someone 's mortgage qualifies for renegotiation rather than foreclosure .
but he says they have been unable to reach such an agreement with countrywide , the nation 's largest sub-prime lender - although its boss has promised to meet them .
spreading to the suburbs the crisis has spread beyond the inner city to the suburbs of cleveland .
last month over 200 people turned up at a church meeting to seek esop 's help in avoiding foreclosure .
worried homeowners meet to " save the american dream " some , such as ron todd , who lives in a suburb just south of the city , are in danger of losing their home after being made redundant by northwest airlines , a big local employer .
others are worried that their neighbourhoods - and the property values of their own houses - will be ruined by the foreclosures all around them .
according to claudia coulton , co-director of the centre for urban poverty at case western reserve university in cleveland , over 10,000 families - one in eight of all owner occupiers in cleveland - will face eviction this year - and the number is expected to rise .
she says the crisis is threatening to " overwhelm the government agencies and community organisations that address the problem " .
nationwide problem cleveland 's situation is not unique .
all around the country , aid agencies report a " tidal wave " of foreclosure cases , says sarah gerecke , director of new york city 's neighborhood housing services .
predatory lending practices ninja loans : no income , no job , no assets 2/28 : mortgages that change from a fixed to a much higher adjustable rate after first two years prepayment penalties : high fees for trying to change terms of mortgage she now employs six people full-time to provide mortgage debt counselling , up from one just two years ago , and could use another 12 .
her concern is that many recently regenerated neighbourhoods in new york will soon be blighted by crisis again .
some people argue that the sub-prime lending crisis has been caused by irresponsible borrowers who lied about their income to cash in on the housing boom .
ms gerecke disagrees .
she says few of her clients would knowingly put their home at risk .
many sub-prime borrowers report that mortgage brokers misrepresented the kind of mortgage they were being offered , their annual income , and even the value of their home .
working together ?
president george w bush 's administration wants to solve the foreclosure crisis by getting lenders and borrowers to renegotiate the terms of loans .
there is a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works robert steel us treasury under secretary for domestic finance read the full interview it is pledging more money for advice services , and has been urging key lenders to take a more sympathetic approach .
robert steel , the us treasury under secretary for domestic finance , told the bbc that the government 's role was " to ensure that lenders and servicers are being flexible with regard to working with borrowers " .
he added that no policy could eliminate foreclosures altogether because there was " a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works . "
but according to mark zandi , chief economist for moody 's , only 1 % of sub-prime mortgages have been renegotiated rather than foreclosed so far .
ms gerecke says a piecemeal approach involving millions of individual renegotiations will not work .
each case takes hours of negotiations , and the mortgage companies ' loan loss departments are overwhelmed by the crisis .
a way out ?
the only way out , says ms gerecke , would be national loan terms agreed for the whole industry .
one such plan has been proposed by sheila bair , head of the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , one of the key banking regulators .
she told the bbc that sub-prime interest rates should not be reset if the borrower has kept up all payments and is not in arrears .
but such a deal is proving extremely difficult to reach , given that thousands of investors around the world own a share of these sub-prime mortgages .
meanwhile marion still sits in her cleveland home every day , trying to stop it being vandalised even though she knows it is merely a matter of time before she will be evicted .
" i am just really working for the banks now , protecting their property from damage , " she says .

by mark easton bbc home editor a bbc poll suggests that three-quarters of britons are optimistic about their family 's future - a much higher figure than when people were asked more than 40 years ago .
family life is changing in the uk - but not in the way we might expect .
most people described family life as fairly or very happy when the bbc commissioned its survey of families in britain , i think our expectation was that we would be measuring the extent to which people 's closest relationships were suffering as a result of the decline in traditional family structures .
when the results came in , we had a surprise .
compared with historical polling , people are more optimistic about their family 's future , more people describe their family as close and they are more likely to say their parents did their best for them .
despite all the changes , we remain remarkable happy with family life - 93 % of us describing it as fairly or very happy .
the results do n't seem to make sense when we look at academic data which links looser family structures to poorer health and happiness .
marriage levels in britain are at an all-time low .
for every three weddings there are now two divorces - the highest rate in europe .
cohabitation has risen 64 % in a decade , with almost half of children now born outside wedlock .
lone parenting we also have by far the highest proportion of lone parents in europe - a quarter of children now live with a single mum .
families ' future ' looks brighter ' academic studies consistently find that such children do less well at school and at work than the offspring of cohabiting or married couples .
so how does one explain this apparent contradiction ?
it may be that our expectations of family life have changed , that we are content with arrangements that would have dissatisfied our forebears .
perhaps our optimism reflects contemporary affluence and stability rather than a confidence in the strength of family structures .
after all , increasing numbers of people - now seven out of 10 - believe that family life is generally becoming less successful , even if they are optimistic about their own .
technology 's role another possible factor is technology .
most people have access to a car or good public transport making increased distance between family members less problematic than it would have been 50 years ago .
the ubiquitous nature of telephony - particularly mobile phones - has made family contact easier , although the internet has not yet become a major method of family communication .
have your say certainly children should be in proper families jackson send us your comments in the poll less than a third of internet users said they used it to contact their family every week and only 8 % made contact every day .
perhaps the most intriguing explanation for the up-beat view of family life discovered in this poll is that it reflects the increasing importance we place upon it .
the global fascination with genealogy and family trees may stem from the same psychological need to understand who we are in a world where identities can easily become blurred .
despite the changing nature of family life , perhaps we value those ties more than ever .

by mark easton bbc home editor a bbc poll suggests that three-quarters of britons are optimistic about their family 's future - a much higher figure than when people were asked more than 40 years ago .
family life is changing in the uk - but not in the way we might expect .
most people described family life as fairly or very happy when the bbc commissioned its survey of families in britain , i think our expectation was that we would be measuring the extent to which people 's closest relationships were suffering as a result of the decline in traditional family structures .
when the results came in , we had a surprise .
compared with historical polling , people are more optimistic about their family 's future , more people describe their family as close and they are more likely to say their parents did their best for them .
despite all the changes , we remain remarkable happy with family life - 93 % of us describing it as fairly or very happy .
the results do n't seem to make sense when we look at academic data which links looser family structures to poorer health and happiness .
marriage levels in britain are at an all-time low .
for every three weddings there are now two divorces - the highest rate in europe .
cohabitation has risen 64 % in a decade , with almost half of children now born outside wedlock .
lone parenting we also have by far the highest proportion of lone parents in europe - a quarter of children now live with a single mum .
families ' future ' looks brighter ' academic studies consistently find that such children do less well at school and at work than the offspring of cohabiting or married couples .
so how does one explain this apparent contradiction ?
it may be that our expectations of family life have changed , that we are content with arrangements that would have dissatisfied our forebears .
perhaps our optimism reflects contemporary affluence and stability rather than a confidence in the strength of family structures .
after all , increasing numbers of people - now seven out of 10 - believe that family life is generally becoming less successful , even if they are optimistic about their own .
technology 's role another possible factor is technology .
most people have access to a car or good public transport making increased distance between family members less problematic than it would have been 50 years ago .
the ubiquitous nature of telephony - particularly mobile phones - has made family contact easier , although the internet has not yet become a major method of family communication .
have your say certainly children should be in proper families jackson send us your comments in the poll less than a third of internet users said they used it to contact their family every week and only 8 % made contact every day .
perhaps the most intriguing explanation for the up-beat view of family life discovered in this poll is that it reflects the increasing importance we place upon it .
the global fascination with genealogy and family trees may stem from the same psychological need to understand who we are in a world where identities can easily become blurred .
despite the changing nature of family life , perhaps we value those ties more than ever .
