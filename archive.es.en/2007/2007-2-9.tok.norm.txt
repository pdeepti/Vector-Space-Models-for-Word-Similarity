but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy . a group of teenage girls staying at a youth hostel in the northern german coastal town of büsum got to meet some real fire-fighting heroes on friday morning .
not that the girls were doing a report on rescue workers , or trying to save a cat that climbed up a tall tree and was mewing like a spoiled child . one hardly expects any sense of purpose or consequence from young people at that awfully weird part of their lives when hormones rage through their bodies and the world seems like one big spring break party . yet one can sympathize with the girls who decided one morning that all they really wanted was to make the northern german winter smell a little less like a wet dog .
they wanted to believe that the right deodorant can paint your room in bright colors and make you feel better than you 've ever felt before - the way it does in television commercials . so they went to the ladies ' room and immersed themselves in the flowery scent of spring meadows .
they sprayed .
and sprayed .
and sprayed . holy smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily , there was no fire in büsum what they did n't realize is that gorgeous whiffs of white lilies and chrysanthemums did not only titillate their bodies - they rose above their heads and collected below the ceiling in a halo of freshness and otherworldly light . with so much explosive energy and real chemistry in the ladies ' room , however , the fire alarm got triggered , alerting the local fire brigade that something funky was going on at the youth hostel . three fire trucks and a patrol car raced to the scene only to find no fire but a ladies ' room that never smelled so sweet . who 's to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would say that unrealistic tv commercials are the root of all evil deodorant commercials in germany do not differ much from their counterparts in other parts of the world where deodorants are portrayed as powerful tools of self-expression .
their message ranges from " it 's so yummi , i could almost eat it for breakfast " to " i believe i can fly even though i do n't do drugs . " whether the girls at the youth hostel thought they were sharing mango lassis rather than antimicrobial cocktails with a touch of aluminum cholorhydrate , or whether they were hoping to become olfactory superheroes to the soundtrack of celine dion , the fact of the matter is : they must have had a blast when the firefighting hunks arrived to save them . " the young ladies will hopefully use not so much scent in the future , " said police spokesperson volker buttgereit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.02.2007 major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone wants action of the low value of the japanese yen world finance chief have plenty to talk about this weekend 's talk in essen , but will they find any common ground , as each country jostles to advance their own interests ? in addition to currency matters , the ministers are planning to assess worldwide economic prospects , global warming , financial governance in africa , stalled multilateral trade talks and the operation of global hedge fund markets . the g7 , consisting of the us , canada , japan , germany , france , italy and britain , has its own reasons for bringing china closer to the seven-nation bloc .
there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- development aid promises often go unfufilled in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .
but thus far they have n't made much progress reaching their targets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.02.2007 " this was just the beginning " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heisenberg says young german cinema is still in its infancy benjamin heisenberg and nicolas wackerbarth belong to the avant-garde of young german cinema .
they 're often called members of the so-called berlin school .
they did n't like the label in this dw-world.de interview . born in 1974 , benjamin heisenberg studied art before joining munich 's university for film and television in 1997 .
one year later , he co-founded film magazine revolver , which is often seen as promoting the so-called berlin school of young german cinema .
his first film , " schläfer " -lrb- sleeper -rrb- , was part of the official selection at the 2005 cannes film festival and won several awards .
he 's currently working on a movie about an austrian bank robber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- left -rrb- in " frau2 sucht happyend " born in 1973 , nicolas wackerbarth trained as an actor at the bavarian theater academy in munich and is studying film direction at the german film and tv academy in berlin since 2000 .
his tv movie " anfänger ! "
-lrb- beginner ! -rrb- received awards in rome , turin and lisbon .
he is a co-publisher of revolver and is currently working on a film about a summer camp for children . dw-world.de : will you go to the berlin film festival ? benjamin heisenberg : of course , but by now it 's turned into hopping from one reception to the next for me .
i regret that a bit , because i get to see fewer movies .
but when you 're looking after the magazine , and especially future projects , the receptions are important . nicolas wackerbarth : i try to limit the number of films by listening to friends whose advice i value .
it usually works to see mainly good films that way . what do you think of the film festival ?
has it changed in recent years ? bh : i think that it 's slowly moving away from a very political festival to one that looks for a balance between political and artistic movies .
that 's what we need in germany : a festival with a broad spectrum that still stands for artistic quality . in addition to your cinematic work , you also publish revolver .
what 's the idea behind that project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from heisenberg 's " schläfer " bh : we 're interested in theory of practice , so to speak .
that means , we 're asking how and why films are made .
so far , we 've mainly poked around european art house cinema , but for a while now , we 've also been thinking about commercial films .
i think we have a lot of catching up to do in that respect in germany .
when you compare our shows with us shows such as " 24 " or " the office , " you can see that there 's still a pretty big difference in quality . i 'd question whether we have the know-how to write a show like " 24 " right now .
if we want to produce such things , we need to build structures that do n't just focus on making a quick buck but offer intelligent education .
at the same time , the avant-garde has to be strengthened .
otherwise it 'll end up like in the us , where independent film is incredibly weak .
france has done a better job to combine the two things via a strong system of public funding . your colleague matthias luthardt recently said that he 'd like you to explain what the berlin school is all about .
what would you tell him ? nw : i think that 's a misunderstanding .
we 're not the organization that awards a seal of approval for the berlin school .
anyone who reads our magazine or the new " best of revolver " book will see that we were never interested in academicism , but a broad range of different approaches . personally , i do n't like that the term is always connected with something that 's missing : no narration , no music , no conflicts .
you could also say that it describes the identity void that has a lot to do with germany .
these are movies that are not embarrassed to film a yellow wall or stage a love story in front of a concrete tub in a pedestrian zone .
that 's enriching and i 'm glad that it 's happening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- l . -rrb- and heisenberg in berlin on thursday , where the weather 's turned wintry for the berlinale bh : none of us are actually from berlin - almost all of us are country bumpkins . i think that our films express a need that we 've all had for a long time : to present our country and the people we live with and the people who we are .
you can see that in the films .
i would n't call it berlin school .
i think that labeling is boring .
it 's one exciting trend within german cinema .
there are many others and that 's good .
they all have to co-exist .
you should n't see it as a stylistic corset . the people that are now known as members of the " nouvelle vague allemande " -lrb- new german wave -rrb- or berlin school will produce heterogeneous movies in the future .
so far they were first films - starting points and products of self-discovery that set a high standard .
but the more people are challenged , the more they 'll branch off in different directions to keep things interesting for themselves as well .
i 'm having fun with this current demand on cinema .
that 's why i 'm looking forward to what will happen .
let me put it this way : this was just the beginning . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german films experience renaissance abroad after decades of neglect , a new type of german movies is getting attention : they might not be blockbusters , but they 're hitting home because of a focus on universal themes .

" we have noticed increased activities by chinese hackers of late , " elmar remberg , the vice president of germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution told the financial times deutschland newspaper . other western states have also reported an increase in industrial espionage by china , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians still prefer classic espionage experts say industrial espionage costs german companies billions of euros each year .
russia and china - two of germany 's most important trading partners - are the worst offenders , according to remberg .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .

21 . " we will start the negotiations on the 21st of this month , " un deputy envoy in the talks albert rohan told journalists in the kosovo capital pristina on friday . serbian president boris tadic on thursday asked the united nations office dealing with kosovo 's status , unosek , to postpone the talks originally planned for feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .

but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy . a group of teenage girls staying at a youth hostel in the northern german coastal town of büsum got to meet some real fire-fighting heroes on friday morning .
not that the girls were doing a report on rescue workers , or trying to save a cat that climbed up a tall tree and was mewing like a spoiled child . one hardly expects any sense of purpose or consequence from young people at that awfully weird part of their lives when hormones rage through their bodies and the world seems like one big spring break party . yet one can sympathize with the girls who decided one morning that all they really wanted was to make the northern german winter smell a little less like a wet dog .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .

and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .

they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .

but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy . a group of teenage girls staying at a youth hostel in the northern german coastal town of büsum got to meet some real fire-fighting heroes on friday morning .
not that the girls were doing a report on rescue workers , or trying to save a cat that climbed up a tall tree and was mewing like a spoiled child . one hardly expects any sense of purpose or consequence from young people at that awfully weird part of their lives when hormones rage through their bodies and the world seems like one big spring break party . yet one can sympathize with the girls who decided one morning that all they really wanted was to make the northern german winter smell a little less like a wet dog .
they wanted to believe that the right deodorant can paint your room in bright colors and make you feel better than you 've ever felt before - the way it does in television commercials . so they went to the ladies ' room and immersed themselves in the flowery scent of spring meadows .
they sprayed .
and sprayed .
and sprayed . holy smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily , there was no fire in büsum what they did n't realize is that gorgeous whiffs of white lilies and chrysanthemums did not only titillate their bodies - they rose above their heads and collected below the ceiling in a halo of freshness and otherworldly light . with so much explosive energy and real chemistry in the ladies ' room , however , the fire alarm got triggered , alerting the local fire brigade that something funky was going on at the youth hostel . three fire trucks and a patrol car raced to the scene only to find no fire but a ladies ' room that never smelled so sweet . who 's to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would say that unrealistic tv commercials are the root of all evil deodorant commercials in germany do not differ much from their counterparts in other parts of the world where deodorants are portrayed as powerful tools of self-expression .
their message ranges from " it 's so yummi , i could almost eat it for breakfast " to " i believe i can fly even though i do n't do drugs . " whether the girls at the youth hostel thought they were sharing mango lassis rather than antimicrobial cocktails with a touch of aluminum cholorhydrate , or whether they were hoping to become olfactory superheroes to the soundtrack of celine dion , the fact of the matter is : they must have had a blast when the firefighting hunks arrived to save them . " the young ladies will hopefully use not so much scent in the future , " said police spokesperson volker buttgereit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" human rights watch spends about half of its time in war zones , " said roth .
" and in these war zones , the militaries are often the ones committing abuses .
in our view , it 's important to talk to the militaries and change their conduct so that they 're more respectful of civilian lives . " not enough in northern afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenneth roth as far as the german military goes , roth has said the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan is hampered by too many caveats and should be far more efficient . " human rights watch would like to see germany play a greater part in the security situation throughout afghanistan , " he said .
" the taliban in the south is posing a serious threat , and currently that burden is born by the united states , canada , britain and the netherlands , but not by germany . " roth also criticized the bundeswehr 's activity in northern afghanistan , saying that it 's not doing enough to ensure security , which is evident in the resurgence of repressive warlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation is worsening again for women in northern afghanistan , said roth " the result is that many girls are now not able to go to school and many women are not able again to go out on the street , " said roth .
" it 's beginning to look like the situation that led to the taliban in the first place . " rights group favors tornados the head of the german section of human rights watch , marianne heuwagen , who accompanied roth in a visit to berlin on thursday , added that she had no qualms about plans to send german tornado reconnaissance planes to afghanistan as early as april . " as long as the tornados are there to safeguard the reconstruction process and protect the civilian population from taliban attacks , human rights watch will remain in favor of the mission , " heuwagen said . pressure to shut down guantanamo while in munich , kenneth roth will also address the issue of the us detention camp at guantanamo .
he said he 'd like to propose a deal between europe and the us that would entail greater involvement on germany 's part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch supports europe in pressuring the us to close guantanamo " we 'd like germany and the eu to say to the us : we will help you resettle the people which can be released , " said roth .
" you take some of them in the united states , we take some in europe in return for you really shutting down the facility . " the plan would involve prosecuting any legitimate terror suspects in fair trials , but everyone else should be released promptly , roth added . if implemented it would be a " grand bargain " that he said would " pressure the bush administration to do what it claims it wants to do - to ultimately close down guantanamo , but to do it now rather than at some indefinite point in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .

the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .

they 're often called members of the so-called berlin school .
they did n't like the label in this dw-world.de interview . born in 1974 , benjamin heisenberg studied art before joining munich 's university for film and television in 1997 .
one year later , he co-founded film magazine revolver , which is often seen as promoting the so-called berlin school of young german cinema .
his first film , " schläfer " -lrb- sleeper -rrb- , was part of the official selection at the 2005 cannes film festival and won several awards .
he 's currently working on a movie about an austrian bank robber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- left -rrb- in " frau2 sucht happyend " born in 1973 , nicolas wackerbarth trained as an actor at the bavarian theater academy in munich and is studying film direction at the german film and tv academy in berlin since 2000 .
his tv movie " anfänger ! "
-lrb- beginner ! -rrb- received awards in rome , turin and lisbon .
he is a co-publisher of revolver and is currently working on a film about a summer camp for children . dw-world.de : will you go to the berlin film festival ? benjamin heisenberg : of course , but by now it 's turned into hopping from one reception to the next for me .
i regret that a bit , because i get to see fewer movies .
but when you 're looking after the magazine , and especially future projects , the receptions are important . nicolas wackerbarth : i try to limit the number of films by listening to friends whose advice i value .
it usually works to see mainly good films that way . what do you think of the film festival ?
has it changed in recent years ? bh : i think that it 's slowly moving away from a very political festival to one that looks for a balance between political and artistic movies .
that 's what we need in germany : a festival with a broad spectrum that still stands for artistic quality . in addition to your cinematic work , you also publish revolver .
what 's the idea behind that project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from heisenberg 's " schläfer " bh : we 're interested in theory of practice , so to speak .
that means , we 're asking how and why films are made .
so far , we 've mainly poked around european art house cinema , but for a while now , we 've also been thinking about commercial films .
i think we have a lot of catching up to do in that respect in germany .
when you compare our shows with us shows such as " 24 " or " the office , " you can see that there 's still a pretty big difference in quality . i 'd question whether we have the know-how to write a show like " 24 " right now .
if we want to produce such things , we need to build structures that do n't just focus on making a quick buck but offer intelligent education .
at the same time , the avant-garde has to be strengthened .
otherwise it 'll end up like in the us , where independent film is incredibly weak .
france has done a better job to combine the two things via a strong system of public funding . your colleague matthias luthardt recently said that he 'd like you to explain what the berlin school is all about .
what would you tell him ? nw : i think that 's a misunderstanding .
we 're not the organization that awards a seal of approval for the berlin school .
anyone who reads our magazine or the new " best of revolver " book will see that we were never interested in academicism , but a broad range of different approaches . personally , i do n't like that the term is always connected with something that 's missing : no narration , no music , no conflicts .
you could also say that it describes the identity void that has a lot to do with germany .
these are movies that are not embarrassed to film a yellow wall or stage a love story in front of a concrete tub in a pedestrian zone .
that 's enriching and i 'm glad that it 's happening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- l . -rrb- and heisenberg in berlin on thursday , where the weather 's turned wintry for the berlinale bh : none of us are actually from berlin - almost all of us are country bumpkins . i think that our films express a need that we 've all had for a long time : to present our country and the people we live with and the people who we are .
you can see that in the films .
i would n't call it berlin school .
i think that labeling is boring .
it 's one exciting trend within german cinema .
there are many others and that 's good .
they all have to co-exist .
you should n't see it as a stylistic corset . the people that are now known as members of the " nouvelle vague allemande " -lrb- new german wave -rrb- or berlin school will produce heterogeneous movies in the future .
so far they were first films - starting points and products of self-discovery that set a high standard .
but the more people are challenged , the more they 'll branch off in different directions to keep things interesting for themselves as well .
i 'm having fun with this current demand on cinema .
that 's why i 'm looking forward to what will happen .
let me put it this way : this was just the beginning . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german films experience renaissance abroad after decades of neglect , a new type of german movies is getting attention : they might not be blockbusters , but they 're hitting home because of a focus on universal themes .

but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy . a group of teenage girls staying at a youth hostel in the northern german coastal town of büsum got to meet some real fire-fighting heroes on friday morning .
not that the girls were doing a report on rescue workers , or trying to save a cat that climbed up a tall tree and was mewing like a spoiled child . one hardly expects any sense of purpose or consequence from young people at that awfully weird part of their lives when hormones rage through their bodies and the world seems like one big spring break party . yet one can sympathize with the girls who decided one morning that all they really wanted was to make the northern german winter smell a little less like a wet dog .
they wanted to believe that the right deodorant can paint your room in bright colors and make you feel better than you 've ever felt before - the way it does in television commercials . so they went to the ladies ' room and immersed themselves in the flowery scent of spring meadows .
they sprayed .
and sprayed .
and sprayed . holy smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily , there was no fire in büsum what they did n't realize is that gorgeous whiffs of white lilies and chrysanthemums did not only titillate their bodies - they rose above their heads and collected below the ceiling in a halo of freshness and otherworldly light . with so much explosive energy and real chemistry in the ladies ' room , however , the fire alarm got triggered , alerting the local fire brigade that something funky was going on at the youth hostel . three fire trucks and a patrol car raced to the scene only to find no fire but a ladies ' room that never smelled so sweet . who 's to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would say that unrealistic tv commercials are the root of all evil deodorant commercials in germany do not differ much from their counterparts in other parts of the world where deodorants are portrayed as powerful tools of self-expression .
their message ranges from " it 's so yummi , i could almost eat it for breakfast " to " i believe i can fly even though i do n't do drugs . " whether the girls at the youth hostel thought they were sharing mango lassis rather than antimicrobial cocktails with a touch of aluminum cholorhydrate , or whether they were hoping to become olfactory superheroes to the soundtrack of celine dion , the fact of the matter is : they must have had a blast when the firefighting hunks arrived to save them .

" human rights watch spends about half of its time in war zones , " said roth .
" and in these war zones , the militaries are often the ones committing abuses .
in our view , it 's important to talk to the militaries and change their conduct so that they 're more respectful of civilian lives . " not enough in northern afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenneth roth as far as the german military goes , roth has said the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan is hampered by too many caveats and should be far more efficient . " human rights watch would like to see germany play a greater part in the security situation throughout afghanistan , " he said .
" the taliban in the south is posing a serious threat , and currently that burden is born by the united states , canada , britain and the netherlands , but not by germany . " roth also criticized the bundeswehr 's activity in northern afghanistan , saying that it 's not doing enough to ensure security , which is evident in the resurgence of repressive warlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation is worsening again for women in northern afghanistan , said roth " the result is that many girls are now not able to go to school and many women are not able again to go out on the street , " said roth .
" it 's beginning to look like the situation that led to the taliban in the first place . " rights group favors tornados the head of the german section of human rights watch , marianne heuwagen , who accompanied roth in a visit to berlin on thursday , added that she had no qualms about plans to send german tornado reconnaissance planes to afghanistan as early as april . " as long as the tornados are there to safeguard the reconstruction process and protect the civilian population from taliban attacks , human rights watch will remain in favor of the mission , " heuwagen said . pressure to shut down guantanamo while in munich , kenneth roth will also address the issue of the us detention camp at guantanamo .
he said he 'd like to propose a deal between europe and the us that would entail greater involvement on germany 's part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch supports europe in pressuring the us to close guantanamo " we 'd like germany and the eu to say to the us : we will help you resettle the people which can be released , " said roth .
" you take some of them in the united states , we take some in europe in return for you really shutting down the facility . " the plan would involve prosecuting any legitimate terror suspects in fair trials , but everyone else should be released promptly , roth added . if implemented it would be a " grand bargain " that he said would " pressure the bush administration to do what it claims it wants to do - to ultimately close down guantanamo , but to do it now rather than at some indefinite point in the future .

" human rights watch spends about half of its time in war zones , " said roth .
" and in these war zones , the militaries are often the ones committing abuses .
in our view , it 's important to talk to the militaries and change their conduct so that they 're more respectful of civilian lives . " not enough in northern afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenneth roth as far as the german military goes , roth has said the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan is hampered by too many caveats and should be far more efficient . " human rights watch would like to see germany play a greater part in the security situation throughout afghanistan , " he said .
" the taliban in the south is posing a serious threat , and currently that burden is born by the united states , canada , britain and the netherlands , but not by germany . " roth also criticized the bundeswehr 's activity in northern afghanistan , saying that it 's not doing enough to ensure security , which is evident in the resurgence of repressive warlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation is worsening again for women in northern afghanistan , said roth " the result is that many girls are now not able to go to school and many women are not able again to go out on the street , " said roth .
" it 's beginning to look like the situation that led to the taliban in the first place . " rights group favors tornados the head of the german section of human rights watch , marianne heuwagen , who accompanied roth in a visit to berlin on thursday , added that she had no qualms about plans to send german tornado reconnaissance planes to afghanistan as early as april . " as long as the tornados are there to safeguard the reconstruction process and protect the civilian population from taliban attacks , human rights watch will remain in favor of the mission , " heuwagen said . pressure to shut down guantanamo while in munich , kenneth roth will also address the issue of the us detention camp at guantanamo .
he said he 'd like to propose a deal between europe and the us that would entail greater involvement on germany 's part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch supports europe in pressuring the us to close guantanamo " we 'd like germany and the eu to say to the us : we will help you resettle the people which can be released , " said roth .
" you take some of them in the united states , we take some in europe in return for you really shutting down the facility . " the plan would involve prosecuting any legitimate terror suspects in fair trials , but everyone else should be released promptly , roth added . if implemented it would be a " grand bargain " that he said would " pressure the bush administration to do what it claims it wants to do - to ultimately close down guantanamo , but to do it now rather than at some indefinite point in the future .

they 're often called members of the so-called berlin school .
they did n't like the label in this dw-world.de interview . born in 1974 , benjamin heisenberg studied art before joining munich 's university for film and television in 1997 .
one year later , he co-founded film magazine revolver , which is often seen as promoting the so-called berlin school of young german cinema .
his first film , " schläfer " -lrb- sleeper -rrb- , was part of the official selection at the 2005 cannes film festival and won several awards .
he 's currently working on a movie about an austrian bank robber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- left -rrb- in " frau2 sucht happyend " born in 1973 , nicolas wackerbarth trained as an actor at the bavarian theater academy in munich and is studying film direction at the german film and tv academy in berlin since 2000 .
his tv movie " anfänger ! "
-lrb- beginner ! -rrb- received awards in rome , turin and lisbon .
he is a co-publisher of revolver and is currently working on a film about a summer camp for children . dw-world.de : will you go to the berlin film festival ? benjamin heisenberg : of course , but by now it 's turned into hopping from one reception to the next for me .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .

above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

" it is a substantive measure ... as aid is a valuable instrument for iran , " said a senior official close to the international atomic energy agency . the united nations security council on dec .
23 imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium and called for cuts in the iaea 's aid to the iranian nuclear program . out of 55 national and regional projects that the iaea has with iran , 22 of them , equal to 40 percent , were either totally or partially frozen , said the confidential report , a copy of which was obtained by the afp news agency . though the measures have been taken , the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors could alter them when it reviews the report in a meeting in vienna starting march 5 . u-turn on last-minute cancellation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran 's berlin embassy said larijani cancelled due to illness , he must be feeling better meanwhile , iran 's top nuclear negotiator decided he did want to attend a weekend meeting of world leaders in munich . ali larijani had called off a trip to europe to discuss the crisis over his country 's atomic ambitions after saying he would attend earlier in the week . klaus treude , a spokesman for the conference , said he had no details on why larijani had changed his mind . before canceling for what iran 's german embassy said were " health reasons , " larijani had been scheduled to hold talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had agreed to meeting the iranian envoy .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets .

despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive .

they 're often called members of the so-called berlin school .
they did n't like the label in this dw-world.de interview . born in 1974 , benjamin heisenberg studied art before joining munich 's university for film and television in 1997 .
one year later , he co-founded film magazine revolver , which is often seen as promoting the so-called berlin school of young german cinema .
his first film , " schläfer " -lrb- sleeper -rrb- , was part of the official selection at the 2005 cannes film festival and won several awards .
he 's currently working on a movie about an austrian bank robber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- left -rrb- in " frau2 sucht happyend " born in 1973 , nicolas wackerbarth trained as an actor at the bavarian theater academy in munich and is studying film direction at the german film and tv academy in berlin since 2000 .
his tv movie " anfänger ! "
-lrb- beginner ! -rrb- received awards in rome , turin and lisbon .
he is a co-publisher of revolver and is currently working on a film about a summer camp for children . dw-world.de : will you go to the berlin film festival ? benjamin heisenberg : of course , but by now it 's turned into hopping from one reception to the next for me .
i regret that a bit , because i get to see fewer movies .
but when you 're looking after the magazine , and especially future projects , the receptions are important . nicolas wackerbarth : i try to limit the number of films by listening to friends whose advice i value .
it usually works to see mainly good films that way . what do you think of the film festival ?
has it changed in recent years ? bh : i think that it 's slowly moving away from a very political festival to one that looks for a balance between political and artistic movies .
that 's what we need in germany : a festival with a broad spectrum that still stands for artistic quality . in addition to your cinematic work , you also publish revolver .
what 's the idea behind that project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from heisenberg 's " schläfer " bh : we 're interested in theory of practice , so to speak .
that means , we 're asking how and why films are made .
so far , we 've mainly poked around european art house cinema , but for a while now , we 've also been thinking about commercial films .
i think we have a lot of catching up to do in that respect in germany .
when you compare our shows with us shows such as " 24 " or " the office , " you can see that there 's still a pretty big difference in quality . i 'd question whether we have the know-how to write a show like " 24 " right now .
if we want to produce such things , we need to build structures that do n't just focus on making a quick buck but offer intelligent education .
at the same time , the avant-garde has to be strengthened .
otherwise it 'll end up like in the us , where independent film is incredibly weak .
france has done a better job to combine the two things via a strong system of public funding . your colleague matthias luthardt recently said that he 'd like you to explain what the berlin school is all about .
what would you tell him ? nw : i think that 's a misunderstanding .
we 're not the organization that awards a seal of approval for the berlin school .
anyone who reads our magazine or the new " best of revolver " book will see that we were never interested in academicism , but a broad range of different approaches . personally , i do n't like that the term is always connected with something that 's missing : no narration , no music , no conflicts .
you could also say that it describes the identity void that has a lot to do with germany .
these are movies that are not embarrassed to film a yellow wall or stage a love story in front of a concrete tub in a pedestrian zone .
that 's enriching and i 'm glad that it 's happening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- l . -rrb- and heisenberg in berlin on thursday , where the weather 's turned wintry for the berlinale bh : none of us are actually from berlin - almost all of us are country bumpkins . i think that our films express a need that we 've all had for a long time : to present our country and the people we live with and the people who we are .
you can see that in the films .
i would n't call it berlin school .
i think that labeling is boring .
it 's one exciting trend within german cinema .
there are many others and that 's good .
they all have to co-exist .
you should n't see it as a stylistic corset . the people that are now known as members of the " nouvelle vague allemande " -lrb- new german wave -rrb- or berlin school will produce heterogeneous movies in the future .
so far they were first films - starting points and products of self-discovery that set a high standard .
but the more people are challenged , the more they 'll branch off in different directions to keep things interesting for themselves as well .
i 'm having fun with this current demand on cinema .
that 's why i 'm looking forward to what will happen .
let me put it this way : this was just the beginning . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german films experience renaissance abroad after decades of neglect , a new type of german movies is getting attention : they might not be blockbusters , but they 're hitting home because of a focus on universal themes .

when you compare our shows with us shows such as " 24 " or " the office , " you can see that there 's still a pretty big difference in quality . i 'd question whether we have the know-how to write a show like " 24 " right now .

that means , we 're asking how and why films are made .
so far , we 've mainly poked around european art house cinema , but for a while now , we 've also been thinking about commercial films .
i think we have a lot of catching up to do in that respect in germany .
when you compare our shows with us shows such as " 24 " or " the office , " you can see that there 's still a pretty big difference in quality . i 'd question whether we have the know-how to write a show like " 24 " right now .
if we want to produce such things , we need to build structures that do n't just focus on making a quick buck but offer intelligent education .
at the same time , the avant-garde has to be strengthened .
otherwise it 'll end up like in the us , where independent film is incredibly weak .
france has done a better job to combine the two things via a strong system of public funding . your colleague matthias luthardt recently said that he 'd like you to explain what the berlin school is all about .
what would you tell him ? nw : i think that 's a misunderstanding .
we 're not the organization that awards a seal of approval for the berlin school .
anyone who reads our magazine or the new " best of revolver " book will see that we were never interested in academicism , but a broad range of different approaches . personally , i do n't like that the term is always connected with something that 's missing : no narration , no music , no conflicts .
you could also say that it describes the identity void that has a lot to do with germany .
these are movies that are not embarrassed to film a yellow wall or stage a love story in front of a concrete tub in a pedestrian zone .
that 's enriching and i 'm glad that it 's happening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wackerbarth -lrb- l . -rrb- and heisenberg in berlin on thursday , where the weather 's turned wintry for the berlinale bh : none of us are actually from berlin - almost all of us are country bumpkins . i think that our films express a need that we 've all had for a long time : to present our country and the people we live with and the people who we are .
you can see that in the films .
i would n't call it berlin school .
i think that labeling is boring .
it 's one exciting trend within german cinema .
there are many others and that 's good .
they all have to co-exist .
you should n't see it as a stylistic corset . the people that are now known as members of the " nouvelle vague allemande " -lrb- new german wave -rrb- or berlin school will produce heterogeneous movies in the future .
so far they were first films - starting points and products of self-discovery that set a high standard .
but the more people are challenged , the more they 'll branch off in different directions to keep things interesting for themselves as well .
i 'm having fun with this current demand on cinema .
that 's why i 'm looking forward to what will happen .
let me put it this way : this was just the beginning . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german films experience renaissance abroad after decades of neglect , a new type of german movies is getting attention : they might not be blockbusters , but they 're hitting home because of a focus on universal themes .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .

i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 09.02.2007 " the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu generally exhausts its soft power policies before examining military options eu foreign policy boss solana javier will receive a peace prize during the munich security conference , which opens friday .
dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .
for the moment , the eu 's priority - even though it 's had well-publicized missions in aceh and congo - will be as a regional pacifier , to police its own backyard .
but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .
they are only now starting to understand they may have to become more active , because america 's authority in the region is weakened .
africa , too , is another huge priority , though progress there is going to be slower .
the europeans are already doing the right things by supporting multilateral african institutions that are modeled on the eu 's own . though there are challenges everywhere , we have to remember that eu foreign policy was only born in the last few years .
we should n't worry too much if it underperforms for a while . sonia phalnikar interviewed hugo brady send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu diplomats seek new inroads in iran nuclear debate iran and the eu appear ready to use a security conference in munich to try and defuse tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions .

but by european standards , let 's be fair , that is actually an achievement . its security has developed and continues to develop .
for instance , it is now very unlikely to anyone 's mind that , should there be a serious problem in europe 's backyard , perhaps in belarus or other places , that the eu will have no part to play .
in fact , it could happen that the only security response will be from the eu .
that 's the road we 're going down now .
like a lot of ideas , people think they are preposterous first and then they become just normal or even obvious .
i do think the eu is making that transition . it 's often been said that europe 's foreign policy has been bedeviled by policy divisions .
the most spectacular differences were over the us-led invasion of iraq in 2002-03 .
does the eu 's failure to speak with a single voice weaken its clout ? when the eu does n't speak with one voice , it has great challenges to make countries - like russia , for instance - take it seriously . in terms of power , the eu is not more than the sum of its parts , which is what it was supposed to do in terms of foreign policy .
i think in trade , the eu is probably more than the sum of its parts .
it is convincing to say that i speak for 450 million european consumers .
but it is not convincing to say to the russians i speak for 450 million european citizens and 27 governments .
they do n't believe that .
neither do the americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , with iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki in tehran in june but at the same time , there are also examples of the europeans working effectively together .
the most obvious one is iran , where europeans ' effective multilateralism is to achieve some kind of compromise and offer iran the carrot of closer trade and cooperation .
that process is yet to be judged a success or a failure . the eu has increasingly mounted peacekeeping missions around the world .
but how willing are eu members to support a collective foreign policy and back it up with hard military force as well as soft power ? i think as the eu missions become more sophisticated and enduring , people will become more accepting of a greater role for them .
i do not think , however , that it will be a very centralized process .
at the same time , there 's a lot more space for integration of european military forces .
over time , as armies become more expensive to maintain , hopefully there will be increasing alignment of eu foreign policy positions , and it will be possible to deploy when necessary , where necessary , more easily and without as many equivocations . i do n't think the eu will ever be a great military power .
the question is whether or not european countries can have clout in the world using the eu as a vehicle to organize and deploy their resources . the eu in general will always exhaust its soft power policies first .
above all , the eu 's premier foreign policy is enlargement , which at very little cost and to great advantage has transformed vast areas of europe and even the european neighborhood .
that will always be the priority issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy waves an eu flag in celebration of bulgaria joining the bloc on jan 1 , 2007 other examples of soft power include the barcelona process , which is the eu 's set of trade agreements and packages for visa arrangements and the like to help stabilize the northern african countries .
that is a worthy process .
then you have not just countries that have just joined the eu , like romania and bulgaria , which have had questionable judicial systems and problems with organized crime .
you also have countries in the balkans , like serbia for instance , that , despite being very belligerent , are making big changes to how their country works .
it 's the same with countries like albania , moldova .
it does n't matter if they do n't become members of the eu .
what matters is that very unstable , dangerous parts of the world are becoming safer places to live simply because they think they might become eu members someday . what do you think is the eu 's single biggest achievement on the foreign policy front ? basically , the notion that europeans should be sending troops together to various parts of the world and working as a single european unit to bring peace and to allow the conditions for democracy and rule of law to return - that 's a significant achievement .
it would be far worse if the europeans had tried to do it and failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana plays an important role in negotiating between eu members the peacekeeping missions may be small-scale .
but i think this is only the beginning of the story .
i think there will be many more to come , and the eu has basically entered a brave new world , where the europeans are expected to act together and by the strength of that expectation will probably drive them forward on to more important and challenging things . it 's never going to be easy .
if families are being sent home people in body bags from eu missions , it 's going to become unpopular .
but this is the challenge of the real world .
and sometimes the eu prefers not to play a real world game .
but its policy unit has done great work in developing common eu positions , they 've developed rough ideas about how they want a european defense market to work , so that they can get more efficient returns .
they 've broken a lot of taboos in a short space of period - that is an achievement . what are the biggest challenges facing the eu 's foreign policy today ? they include both housekeeping issues and global issues .
when it comes to housekeeping issues , priorities include strengthening the role of the high representative without the eu 's constitution as well as aligning internal security priorities with foreign policy .
in the eu , things like terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration or the challenge of global migration are dealt with in legally separate ways .
but they 're clearly connected with foreign policy .
so the point is to ensure coherence in eu policies in these issues , so that the member states ' internal policies and the eu 's foreign policy are working together rather than duplicating each other 's efforts . on a global level , the eu 's most important challenge is russia and the accompanying question of energy security .
the latter is both an economic and security issue .
the second most important thing is to repair the transatlantic relationship .
i do n't think that will happen under the current white house administration .
the europeans need to be ready to engage with whoever takes over the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east conflict has caused widespread suffering the middle east , too , is a serious foreign policy challenge for the europeans .

dw-world.de spoke to an analyst about the challenges to the bloc 's security and foreign policy . hugo brady is a research fellow at the center for european reform in london .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the european union 's foreign and security policy . dw-world.de : at the annual security conference , which opens in munich on friday , javier solana will be awarded a prize for his efforts in promoting peace as the eu 's foreign policy chief .
set up in 1997 , the eu 's common foreign and joint security policy is a young one .
is the eu already a major peacemaking power in the world ? hugo brady : the eu , in a relatively short time , has come a very long distance in terms of a leap of the imagination in developing its security and defense framework .
not so very long ago , and particularly here in london , it was thought that the eu really had no role either as a regional pacifier , as in settling conflicts in its own backyard as in the balkans , or as a global actor in any sense militarily .
today the eu is doing around 14 missions abroad involving either peacekeeping with military means or training of policemen abroad or border monitoring in flashpoint areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu soldiers were present in congo to secure elections the missions are mostly small-scale .

but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy . a group of teenage girls staying at a youth hostel in the northern german coastal town of büsum got to meet some real fire-fighting heroes on friday morning .
not that the girls were doing a report on rescue workers , or trying to save a cat that climbed up a tall tree and was mewing like a spoiled child . one hardly expects any sense of purpose or consequence from young people at that awfully weird part of their lives when hormones rage through their bodies and the world seems like one big spring break party . yet one can sympathize with the girls who decided one morning that all they really wanted was to make the northern german winter smell a little less like a wet dog .
they wanted to believe that the right deodorant can paint your room in bright colors and make you feel better than you 've ever felt before - the way it does in television commercials . so they went to the ladies ' room and immersed themselves in the flowery scent of spring meadows .
they sprayed .
and sprayed .
and sprayed . holy smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily , there was no fire in büsum what they did n't realize is that gorgeous whiffs of white lilies and chrysanthemums did not only titillate their bodies - they rose above their heads and collected below the ceiling in a halo of freshness and otherworldly light . with so much explosive energy and real chemistry in the ladies ' room , however , the fire alarm got triggered , alerting the local fire brigade that something funky was going on at the youth hostel . three fire trucks and a patrol car raced to the scene only to find no fire but a ladies ' room that never smelled so sweet . who 's to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would say that unrealistic tv commercials are the root of all evil deodorant commercials in germany do not differ much from their counterparts in other parts of the world where deodorants are portrayed as powerful tools of self-expression .
their message ranges from " it 's so yummi , i could almost eat it for breakfast " to " i believe i can fly even though i do n't do drugs . " whether the girls at the youth hostel thought they were sharing mango lassis rather than antimicrobial cocktails with a touch of aluminum cholorhydrate , or whether they were hoping to become olfactory superheroes to the soundtrack of celine dion , the fact of the matter is : they must have had a blast when the firefighting hunks arrived to save them .

" we have noticed increased activities by chinese hackers of late , " elmar remberg , the vice president of germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution told the financial times deutschland newspaper . other western states have also reported an increase in industrial espionage by china , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians still prefer classic espionage experts say industrial espionage costs german companies billions of euros each year .
russia and china - two of germany 's most important trading partners - are the worst offenders , according to remberg . " whereas the russian services operate primarily in the classic form , with agents , the chinese are mainly active in the electronic sector , " he said . weak spots one problem is the increasing use of internet telephony by companies , remberg said . " this is where two dangers are coming together : communication per se and the internet , " remberg said , adding that interns might also pose a problem . companies that develop or distribute high technology are especially prone to being spied on , according to the consortium for industry safety -lrb- asw -rrb- .
smaller and medium-sized firms that develop highly specialized products are also targets , according to asw 's executive director , berthold stoppelkamp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the gate is n't enough he said that smaller companies were also more vulnerable to spy attacks as the larger ones had already established security departments for the most part . " security is not only about having a guard at the door , " stoppelkamp said , adding that it systems had to be protected and employees needed to receive training in how to behave when suspicious things happened . chinese groups not welcome ? espionage and counterfeiting contribute to china 's huge export success , according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- , a government agency . " an increasing number of german companies no longer want to host chinese delegations , because the danger of lifting trade secrets is too high , " said the bfai 's china expert , corinne abele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german original -lrb- left -rrb- vs. chinese counterfeit she added that no numbers on product piracy are available .
while chinese customs officials are meant to stop counterfeited products from leaving the country , they appear to only do random checks . " we 'll certainly have to deal with the problem for another couple of years , " abele said . china to surpass germany china is expected to surpass germany as the world 's leading exporter next year .
german officials announced thursday that the country was the world 's biggest exporter in 2006 , with a record foreign trade surplus of 162 billion euros -lrb- $ 209 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is still shipping more goods abroad than anyone else exports climbed 13.7 percent from a year ago to 893.6 billion euros while imports rose 16.5 percent to 731.7 billion euros , officials for the federal statistics office said . the 162-billion-euro surplus was around 2.5 percent more than the 2005 surplus of 158.2 billion euros . exports remained a driving force in the german economy , which grew at a faster than expected 2.5 percent in 2006 - the best performance in six years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

there was little point in holding discussions about the global economy and interest rates without the participation of a heavyweight like china , german deputy finance minister thomas mirow said . germany also wants to integrate the other emerging economies brazil , india , mexico and south africa into the g7 's discussions on a regular basis , without actually enlarging the group , which , together with russia , is known as the g8 . euro zone vs. the pacific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese are pleased with economic recovery but it is the japanese yen that is threatening to drive a wedge between the euro zone on the one hand and japan and the united states on the other on what steps - if any - to take to stem a slide in the currency .
the yen has fallen 9 percent against the euro since last april , prompting fears in europe that euro zone exports will become less competitive , endangering a fledgling economic recovery . but japanese officials seem unwilling to take any action . " overall , -lrb- the yen 's weakness -rrb- will have a positive effect , " bank of japan policy board member hidehiko haru told reporters on thursday . japanese finance minister koji omi , before heading off to essen , also showed little appetite for action , saying only that the currency 's value should reflect the health of the economy . german carmakers complaining german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is hosting the talks in the palatial villa hügel mansion in the south of essen , was nevertheless adamant that the issue be discussed again this time round .
german carmakers voiced concern about the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the g7 demand greater spending on poverty and aids in africa " the yen exchange rate is increasingly becoming an invisible price and cost benefit for importers of japanese vehicles , giving them a competitive advantage , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german automobile industry federation told the frankfurter rundschau . gottschalk said this development was due to market forces and had nothing to do " with the competitive strength or attraction of the products . " us dismissive in the view of washington and tokyo , the japanese currency is fairly valued by competitive markets , and japanese officials have said the yen would not be high on the agenda . " i heard that we are going to have wide-ranging discussions on the domestic and overseas economies , as well as monetary and foreign exchange issues , " omi said .
" i want to explain the current situation of the japanese economy and how a steady recovery is taking place . " the us has made it clear it is far more concerned about the chinese yuan , which it says should be allowed greater room to appreciate , arguing that an undervalued yuan gives chinese goods an unfair competitive advantage on the us market and costs us jobs . hedge fund angst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 finance ministers at last year 's meeting in washington host nation germany is also expected to pressure for tighter control of highly speculative hedge funds , a step the us and britain have so far resisted . steinbrück urged hedge fund managers to show greater awareness of the political consequences of their dealings . " if a -lrb- domino -rrb- falls over , it will take five or six others down with it , " he said in a television interview ahead of the meeting .
" the result is a serious financial crisis .
this can not be ruled out . " steinbrück also called for a registration of all the highly speculative funds that operate with foreign capital .
also of concern is " carry trade " under which hedge funds and other investors borrow in one currency at rock bottom interest rates and put the cash into higher-yielding assets elsewhere . european central bank chief jean-claude trichet has described the " carry trades " as a " phenomenon fostered by the low level of volatility in global financial markets .

21 . " we will start the negotiations on the 21st of this month , " un deputy envoy in the talks albert rohan told journalists in the kosovo capital pristina on friday . serbian president boris tadic on thursday asked the united nations office dealing with kosovo 's status , unosek , to postpone the talks originally planned for feb .

" " we will finish them -lrb- the talks -rrb- as planned before the end of march , " rohan added after meeting with kosovo 's ethnic albanian president fatmir sejdiu . sejdiu , for his part , said that pristina accepted unosek 's decision even though it had reservations about any further delays to resolving kosovo 's status . " we said that the delay wo n't have positive effects and this delay is a sign of understanding from unosek , " sejdiu told reporters .
" we insist on fast dynamics .
delaying the process will not help . " final settlement coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari originally planned the final round of talks to start on feb .
13 un mediator ahtisaari said thursday that he expects the final status of the albanian-majority serbian province to be settled well before the german presidency of the european union ends in late june . asked if he expected the contentious issue to be settled by the end of june , when the six-month german presidency is due to end , ahtisaari said , " i hope it is solved much earlier than that . " he stressed that once he finalizes his package and turns it over to the un security council by the end of march , " it is out my hand . ...
i expect them -lrb- the council members -rrb- to do their job . " constructive amendments last week , ahtisaari unveiled a settlement plan offering self-governance to the disputed province .
although it does not specifically mention independence , the plan is opposed by serbian leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kosovo albanians demonstrated against the un-led process in november " i am prepared to consider constructive amendments and i am willing to integrate compromise solutions that parties might reach , " he said .
" i want to give both parties the chance once again to make their points .
i will then finalize my settlement proposal for submission to the security council . " asked whether his plan amounted to independence in all but name for kosovo , ahtisaari replied that " both parties have drawn the conclusion on the basis of this package that ... independence -lrb- for kosovo -rrb- will be supervised by the international community . " though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign drove out serbian forces over a crackdown against ethnic albanian civilians . a nato-led force has overseen peace in the province ever since . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu troika presses serbia for progress on kosovo a high-level eu delegation encouraged serbian politicians to form a pro-european government coalition and urged them to be " constructive " in the run-up to the final decision on the future of kosovo .

the move is being made due to concerns that the beijing olympic village could come to resemble " a reality tv show " .
" blogging would erode the sanctuary of the olympic village , " said the secretary-general of the australian olympic committee , craig phillips .
there are concerns blogging might lead competitors to " launch electronic missiles " at other athletes , he said .
after the cauldron of competition , mr phillips worries that athletes might use blogs to let off steam .
" the nature of the technology is such that if someone came off the field or the track annoyed about something , they could spout off at their competitors or their coaches .
that would undermine team spirit , " he said .
" blogging would allow athletes to launch missiles electronically , and it could become a real free for all . "
' delicate issue ' mr phillips also said there were commercial considerations .
the committee fears that non-olympic sponsors might use blogs to hijack the games in an increasingly common commercial practice known as ambush marketing .
" we rely on our sponsors and we have to protect them , " mr phillips said .
meeting in lausanne , switzerland this week , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- left the door open for blogging in beijing , but decided to investigate the issue further , before making a final decision .
" in principle , the commission is not against , " said athletes ' commission chairman and former olympic pole vaulter sergei bubka , " but it 's quite a delicate issue and we decided to investigate a little more . "
" it 's modern way for people who want to express their opinion , but we believe there should be certain rules respected by every athlete who participates in the games and who lives in the villages . "
at present , competing athletes are not allowed to work as journalists or commentators during the games .
what the ioc will ultimately have to decide is whether bloggers fall within that category , and possibly update its rule book to acknowledge the age of the blog .

it is estimated up to 3,000 people in northern ireland lost money after the english company ceased trading .
a spokesperson said they want the views of every person affected from northern ireland taken into account during the government inquiry into the collapse .
the christmas hamper firm went into administration last october .
farepak customers paid monthly sums to the firm or its agents towards vouchers or food hampers for the festive season .
however , when the company went into administration , it left them with limited hopes of compensation .
carol edwards of the consumer council said : " thousands of people found themselves facing a bleak christmas last year through no fault of their own .
" having saved diligently for months , they found themselves out of pocket with little prospect of getting their money back .
" we want to hear these stories and any ideas about how we can develop better ways to save that offer better protection for our money . "
victims were warned last month they would get no more than 5p in every pound they lost when the firm failed .
more than 150,000 people lost an average of £ 400 .
administrators now hope to move the firm into voluntary liquidation - which would allow its assets to be sold and turned into cash to pay off creditors .
a voluntary fund set up in the run-up to christmas raised about £ 7m to mitigate the effect of the collapse on savers .

there were no casualties in the explosion at the kamakhya railway station in the main city of guwahati .
no group has so far said it carried out the attack .
earlier this week , the separatist united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- withdrew a planned boycott of the games on the request of some top athletes .
ulfa is fighting one of india 's longest-running insurgencies to establish an independent homeland in assam .
the head of india 's ruling congress party , sonia gandhi , is due to open the country 's 33rd national games in guwahati .
more than 7,000 athletes and officials have gathered in the city for the event .
spike " the explosion was powerful , but with no passengers around the place a possible disaster was averted , " senior police official rajen singh told the afp news agency .
" we are not sure who was behind the explosion , " he said .
there has been an upsurge in violence in assam in recent months with officials pointing to the role of ulfa .
the group has been blamed for a number of bombings and shootings in which about 90 migrant workers were killed .
the group , however , has said it would not disturb the national games .

here , martin sime , chief executive of the scottish council for voluntary organisations , argues that politicians appear to have lost the battle for people 's " hearts and minds " .
looming elections mean that our media is full of debate about the so-called big issues of our time - independence , the economy , the war in iraq .
the party machines are grinding into action .
glossy manifestos are imminent .
our politicians will shortly announce what they promise to do for and to us over the next four years .
martin sime , who has spent 20 years in the voluntary sector yet enthusiasm for politics is in steep , maybe terminal , decline .
party memberships are down and who would have thought that fewer than half the electorate would bother to vote in only the second scottish parliament in 300 years .
growing numbers of people do n't seem to care about who gets elected or what government does .
could it be that our politicians are on the wrong track ?
over the last eight years we 've had swathes of new legislation and regulation , strategies and action plans .
there 's been an unprecedented growth in the public sector - more people doing more things for us .
does 21st century scotland need more of the same ?
one way to address that question is to examine the really big issues and challenges facing our society and how we , government and people , might tackle them .
from this it is possible to present a compelling argument about why politics and government must change .
take health as an example .
by any analysis we need a radical shift which is more about improving health and enabling those who do have health problems to live as normally as possible .
we need our politicians to see themselves as enablers first and as regulators and managers a poor second what do you want from politicians ?
spending more and more money treating more illnesses with our growing elderly demographic is unsustainable .
our politicians may well be right to go round banning things like fast food and smoking but is it enough ?
public service adverts exhorting us to eat more healthily or not to take drugs seem to have little impact .
just what , exactly , are our politicians to do ?
a similar story can be seen over recycling and energy .
it was never going to be enough just to drop multi-coloured bins outside our doors and expect everyone to fill them with the right things .
despite record investment , the quantity of rubbish keeps rising and landfill sites are filling up .
a throw-away culture has taken hold .
' nurture the good ' the same is true about energy and fuel consumption , only on this issue there are the added expectations of an economic growth agenda which has wide political support .
again our politicians seem to have very limited powers to make significant inroads into rising demand .
what these examples show is the limits of political power in the modern world .
the really big issues are about our behaviour and actions and what we choose to do individually and collectively .
and we increasingly do n't seem to care to be legislated , regulated or lectured to by a nanny state .
positive ways forward will require a change of mindset .
a start might be for government to spend more time and resources nurturing the good than outlawing the bad .
is this how we see our politicians ?
far-off and remote ?
self-help and mutual aid help many people with long-term conditions for a tiny fraction of the cost of the nhs .
community food initiatives , keep-fit classes and voluntary sports activities could do so much more with the right support .
part of the way forward is about winning hearts and minds and many of our politicians seem to have lost the ability to do that .
new solutions to pressing problems need to be built on the foundations of the small scale , on personal and group initiatives working upwards from the community rather than downwards from some party manifesto .
car sharing , furniture recycling , bike co-ops and sustainable community energy projects already exist , but must move from the periphery to the strategic centre as exemplars where people are taking responsibility and making a difference .
in short we need our politicians to see themselves as enablers first and as regulators and managers a poor second .
such a cultural shift will not come easily nor is it simple to help people help themselves .
but more of the same really is n't fit for purpose in our new circumstances .
by all means let 's have our ritualistic debates on traditional ground , but we also desperately need a different kind of government with subtler notions of how to work with the grain of our society .

st teilo 's church had stood near pontarddulais since the 13th century .
it fell into disrepair and to save the medieval structure it was taken down and rebuilt at the museum of welsh life at st fagans .
the work has taken over 15 years and it is now welcoming members of its old congregation to mark st teilo 's day .
some of those who used to sit in the wooden pews when the church was at pontarddulais are among around 65 people from the town travelling to cardiff on friday .
the inside has been refurbished to look like it would have done in 1520 the vicar of pontarddulais , the reverend john walters , who will take the service , said : " st teilo 's was still standing when i first came here to pontarddulais as vicar 24 years ago , but i do n't think there had been a service there since about 1970 .
" it was just an empty shell .
" but some of those travelling remember attending services there .
" it 's something that we are very much looking forward to and people are quite excited . "
he said when the idea was first raised of moving the church it did not sit well with everyone .
" we do n't know what would have happened to it had it stayed where it was - it may have become just ruins , " he added .
" now i think it is a good resource for wales and pontarddulais is very proud that the we can show off this building to people who visit the museum from all over the world . "
the church once stood on the outskirts of pontarddulais although the church looks the same from the outside , the inside has been decorated to recreate how it would have looked 500 years ago .
this has been done using the traditional building methods and techniques .
rare wall paintings , found in the church dating from the 16th century , have also been refurbished .
it is due to officially open in october 2007 as part of the national museum wales ' centenary celebrations .

the survey of more than 2,000 adults also found 27 % regretted not making the most of the opportunities at school .
more than a quarter -lrb- 28 % -rrb- said they did not work hard enough while they were at school and felt they were now living with the consequences .
the poll found 35 % had opted to go back to college to get more qualifications .
and more than one in four -lrb- 30 % -rrb- of those who had completed retraining said it had made them more employable and 17 % had got a pay rise .
more than a quarter -lrb- 26 % -rrb- said their job was more rewarding as a result of retraining .
alan sugar julia dowd , from the lsc , said : " unfortunately , in today 's competitive world , it 's highly unusual for people to follow the likes of alan sugar and richard branson and achieve great success without any qualifications .
" now , the best chance anyone can have is to achieve at least five good gcses , or a level 2 diploma .
whatever your background or talents there will be a learning option for you phil hope , skills minister " so today , we are calling on all young people to ensure they achieve at least the minimum set of qualifications before leaving college or school , which will increase their employability . "
skills minister phil hope said : " with 20 % of adults saying they did not realise how their choices at school and college would impact their career options , this research underlines the importance for young people still in learning to think hard about their future as the decisions they make will affect the rest of their lives .
" our message is that whatever your background or talents there will be a learning option for you .

on thursday , chancellor gordon brown said firms must meet their responsibilities to train their staff .
he said workers had to be offered second and third chances to develop the right skills if britain was to compete in the world .
but while some firms worked hard to make that happen , many others were " too short-termist or take short cuts or do n't believe that they should contribute " .
but shadow education secretary , david willetts , said mr brown was telling employers to make up for the failure of his government 's education system .
" gordon brown is right to be worried about skills levels in britain , " he said .
" after 10 years in government , more than 20,000 children still leave school without a single gcse and fewer than 50 % achieve five good gcses including english and maths . "

remains of substantial walls pre-dating the 16th century barn at dunster were unearthed during work to convert the building into a community centre .
experts said the two walls , paving and glazed tile fragments were almost certainly part of the benedictine priory of dunster dating back to 1127 .
the finds have been recorded and grassed over for safe-keeping .
sensitive development bob croft , somerset county council 's county archaeologist , said the finds suggest a wealth of history below the surface .
" this shows there is considerable potential for the survival of more medieval remains associated with the priory , " he said .
" this is something that any future development in this area will have to be sensitive to . "
a barn was first recorded on the dunster site in 1498 and the present example is thought to date from 16th century .
it was falling into disrepair until the £ 450,000 restoration project began in late 2005 .
a formal opening ceremony of the barn as a community centre , with meeting room and reception area , is due to take place in may .

president pierre nkurunziza said she had been dismissed because of her insubordination and irresponsibility .
mrs barampama was a supporter of hussein radjabu , the ousted chairman of the governing forces for the defence of democracy -lrb- fdd -rrb- party .
divisions in the fdd , formerly a rebel group that won elections in 2005 , have prompted fears of renewed violence .
the elections were the culmination of a peace process intended to end 12 years of conflict between hutu rebels and the tutsi-dominated army .
' interference ' a special congress of the fdd party held this week chose jeremy ngendakumana as the new chairman , replacing mr radjabu , who was accused of abuse of power .
mr radjabu , who refused to attend the party congress , has denied accusations against him .
mrs barampama was appointed after her predecessor alice nzomukunda resigned over corruption and human rights abuses which she said were hampering burundi 's progress .
she also accused mr radjabu of interfering with her work .
the bbc 's kazungu lozy in bujumbura says mrs barampama was very close to the ousted fdd chairman and was appointed amid sharp disagreements within the governing party .
it is expected that mrs nzomukunda will be reinstated as the second vice-president .
since independence in 1961 , burundi has been plagued by tension between the dominant tutsi minority and hutu majority .
more than 300,000 people died in the war sparked in 1993 by the assassination of burundi 's first hutu head of state and democratically elected president , melchior ndadaye .

president pierre nkurunziza said she had been dismissed because of her insubordination and irresponsibility .
mrs barampama was a supporter of hussein radjabu , the ousted chairman of the governing forces for the defence of democracy -lrb- fdd -rrb- party .
divisions in the fdd , formerly a rebel group that won elections in 2005 , have prompted fears of renewed violence .
the elections were the culmination of a peace process intended to end 12 years of conflict between hutu rebels and the tutsi-dominated army .
' interference ' a special congress of the fdd party held this week chose jeremy ngendakumana as the new chairman , replacing mr radjabu , who was accused of abuse of power .
mr radjabu , who refused to attend the party congress , has denied accusations against him .
mrs barampama was appointed after her predecessor alice nzomukunda resigned over corruption and human rights abuses which she said were hampering burundi 's progress .
she also accused mr radjabu of interfering with her work .
the bbc 's kazungu lozy in bujumbura says mrs barampama was very close to the ousted fdd chairman and was appointed amid sharp disagreements within the governing party .
it is expected that mrs nzomukunda will be reinstated as the second vice-president .
