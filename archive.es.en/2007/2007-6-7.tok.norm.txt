action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate . " but real emission cuts still have to be negotiated , and countries must recognize the need for staying below 2 degrees celsius , " he added .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .
under the direction of renowned conductor kent nagano , the munich state opera company will be premiering " alice in wonderland " by korean composer unsuk chin in the course of this year 's event .
from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .
sitting through wagner 's momentous opera 's should be a piece of cake for the fans that have already been on the ticket waiting list for years .
in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals africa -pipe- 07.06.2007 " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls are the fastest growing group of hiv / aids sufferers , said sharma at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "

" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

" strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .

denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .
in comparison , sweden granted more than 22,000 requests , many of them from iraqis fleeing the war in their home country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on changes to asylum laws chancellor merkel 's government agreed to several changes in the way the country deals with foreigners , including giving more rights to refugees who have lived in germany for years without official status .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .

aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .

from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .

in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .

much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate . " but real emission cuts still have to be negotiated , and countries must recognize the need for staying below 2 degrees celsius , " he added .
" now is the time for concrete actions . " dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "

" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate . " but real emission cuts still have to be negotiated , and countries must recognize the need for staying below 2 degrees celsius , " he added .
" now is the time for concrete actions . " dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .
i 'm more afraid of what my editor is going to say about the bar tab . " nick amies , reporting from rostock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate . " but real emission cuts still have to be negotiated , and countries must recognize the need for staying below 2 degrees celsius , " he added .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .
in comparison , sweden granted more than 22,000 requests , many of them from iraqis fleeing the war in their home country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on changes to asylum laws chancellor merkel 's government agreed to several changes in the way the country deals with foreigners , including giving more rights to refugees who have lived in germany for years without official status .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .
i 'm more afraid of what my editor is going to say about the bar tab . " nick amies , reporting from rostock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .
in comparison , sweden granted more than 22,000 requests , many of them from iraqis fleeing the war in their home country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on changes to asylum laws chancellor merkel 's government agreed to several changes in the way the country deals with foreigners , including giving more rights to refugees who have lived in germany for years without official status .

putin told reporters that moscow and washington could jointly operate the gabala radar station in azerbaijan which is currently rented out to russia . the russian leader , standing next to bush while speaking to correspondents at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in northern germany , said he had cleared the offer with ilham aliyev , the president of azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs protested against plans to station part of the us missile system in the country if the proposal was accepted by washington , russia would not need to retarget europe in response to the us plan to station elements of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic , putin added . " this will make it unnecessary for us to place our offensive complexes along the borders with europe , " putin said . he added that such an arrangement would provide security for all of europe , rather than just parts of the continent . kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov said russia was ready to " completely share " all technical data from the gabala radar station with the us . the solution offered by putin would " lead to a substantial easing of tensions , " said peskov , adding : " our concerns will disappear . " strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .

from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .

in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .
aditi sharma is the international hiv / aids campaign coordinator for action aid , an international health , education and human rights organization based in johannesburg . nick amies interviewed aditi scharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .

efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .

many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .

this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .
under the direction of renowned conductor kent nagano , the munich state opera company will be premiering " alice in wonderland " by korean composer unsuk chin in the course of this year 's event .
from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .
sitting through wagner 's momentous opera 's should be a piece of cake for the fans that have already been on the ticket waiting list for years .
in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 07.06.2007 women fleeing eastern germany , leaving men behind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sprinting for the west , jobs and intellectual equals higher education levels and a lack of job opportunities have led many young women to leave eastern germany .
the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .

frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .

they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .

frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .

frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .

accelerated deportation .
more rights for recognized refugees .
the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .
the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .
in comparison , sweden granted more than 22,000 requests , many of them from iraqis fleeing the war in their home country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on changes to asylum laws chancellor merkel 's government agreed to several changes in the way the country deals with foreigners , including giving more rights to refugees who have lived in germany for years without official status .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "

these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .

" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .

" women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .

the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .
this practice of " asylum shopping " must stop , frattini said .

there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .

the european commission unveiled plans wednesday to harmonize asylum rules across the european union . approximately 12 percent of asylum seekers apply to more than one country , looking for the one most likely to accept them or give them the best benefits , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said wednesday .

there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .

they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .

" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .
russia downplays comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to keep us-russian disagreements from overshadowing the g8 on sunday , putin threatened to aim russian missiles at european targets if the anti-missile system goes into effect .
moscow seemed to back-peddle from this assertion wednesday , saying that it was only " one possible means " for russia to respond .
putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.
german chancellor angela merkel , the meeting 's host , hopes to prevent the bush-putin meeting from overshadowing the three-day summit so that the leaders can focus on salvaging efforts to produce an accord that convinces the world that the g8 nations are serious about countering global warming . dw staff with wire material -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .
the best they could get from him was a statement that their 50 percent-by-2050 emissions reduction proposal would be ' seriously considered . '
that 's a pretty tiny landmark . " the world wildlife fund said that , although some progress towards cutting global emissions had been made , " heads of state failed to give concrete figures and timelines " for cuts .
" in bali we will see what the agreement is worth , " said hans verolme , director of the wwf 's climate change program .
he added that support by the eu , japan and canada to halve carbon pollution by 2050 " means we are a step closer to taking real action for the world 's climate . " but real emission cuts still have to be negotiated , and countries must recognize the need for staying below 2 degrees celsius , " he added .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .

"
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .
russia " not an enemy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech protesters express their opposition to the missile shield monday bush said he was " looking forward " to his talks with putin thursday and would use the meeting to answer moscow 's concerns over the missile shield .
" i will explain to him once again that a missile defense shield is aimed at a rogue regime that may try to hold russia and or europe hostage , " bush said .
" it is important for russia and russians to understand that i believe the cold war ended , that russia is not an enemy of the united states , that there 's a lot of areas where we can work together , " he said .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals africa -pipe- 07.06.2007 " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls are the fastest growing group of hiv / aids sufferers , said sharma at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

" strategic dialogue peskov said the us needed more time to study the pros and cons of the russian offer . " you would not expect any readiness to accept this immediately ... it is too complicated and sensitive , " he said . bush did not respond to the offer but described his talks with putin as " open and constructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials already have a pretty clear plan of what kind of system they want " we will continue to talk about missile defense in the coming weeks , " bush said . the us president told reporters he wanted a " constructive and strategic dialogue " with his russian counterpart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals africa -pipe- 07.06.2007 " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls are the fastest growing group of hiv / aids sufferers , said sharma at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .
aditi sharma is the international hiv / aids campaign coordinator for action aid , an international health , education and human rights organization based in johannesburg . nick amies interviewed aditi scharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .
under the direction of renowned conductor kent nagano , the munich state opera company will be premiering " alice in wonderland " by korean composer unsuk chin in the course of this year 's event .
from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .
sitting through wagner 's momentous opera 's should be a piece of cake for the fans that have already been on the ticket waiting list for years .
in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 07.06.2007 women fleeing eastern germany , leaving men behind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sprinting for the west , jobs and intellectual equals higher education levels and a lack of job opportunities have led many young women to leave eastern germany .
the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .

much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .

it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

" the summit host , merkel said she was " very , very satisfied " with the agreement but acknowledged that the accord was a compromise that fell short of her hopes for a binding deal . " many countries moved on this issue , " merkel said , adding that the accord gave impetus to negotiations beginning in bali in december to find a successor to the un-backed kyoto protocol on capping greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 . " the very best we could achieve has been achieved , " merkel said . piling on the pressure the chancellor , who holds the g8 presidency , had piled the pressure on us president george w. bush to bring his country , as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , on board a process to keep the planet from overheating . as member states wrangled over the final text thursday , bush took a conciliatory stance , saying the united states was ready to take the leading role in a global bid to fight climate change but that china and india must join in . " the us will be actively involved , if not taking the lead , in a post-kyoto framework , a post-kyoto deal , " bush said after talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the summit . taking the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is blair 's last g8 summit blair had said he was holding out hope for a pact on significant emission cuts at the summit that would pave the road to a strong deal at a un meeting bali , indonesia in december as the successor to kyoto . " i think there is a very substantial coming together around the need to make sure that we have a substantial reduction in emissions and find the right process and right way to achieve that , " he said . merkel 's aim had been for the world 's most industrialized nations to take the lead in setting key benchmarks in the run-up to the un meeting in bali . us resistance china , india and other developing countries , which have been invited to participate in the summit , are not required to make targeted emissions cuts under kyoto - a weakness washington has frequently criticized . the united states , the only g8 country that has not ratified the kyoto protocol , has flatly rejected any mandatory targets in a new pact . bush surprised many last week by offering a counter-proposal in which the united states and up to 14 other big emitters would agree by the end of next year " a long-term global goal " for reducing greenhouse gases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharp words have no doubt been spoken merkel has insisted that any agreement come within a un-framework , a condition bush warmed to at the summit . bush sharply rejected accusations that washington was doing nothing to tackle climate change , telling reporters that us greenhouse gas emissions had declined in the last year despite the fact that the economy had grown . " we are taking steps necessary to be good stewards of the environment and at the same time advance technologies , " he said . cool response from climate activists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists tried to reach the g8 summit hotel via boat on thursday climate change campaigners meanwhile called the agreement " weak " , saying it failed to commit to serious reduction targets . " chancellor merkel and prime minister blair are trying to portray this as a strong agreement , " said philip clapp , president of the us national environmental trust .
" but president bush did n't give them an inch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals africa -pipe- 07.06.2007 " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls are the fastest growing group of hiv / aids sufferers , said sharma at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .
aditi sharma is the international hiv / aids campaign coordinator for action aid , an international health , education and human rights organization based in johannesburg . nick amies interviewed aditi scharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de lofty goals are set aside as g8 summit gets underway g8 leaders kicked off this year 's much-anticipated summit at a dinner in a baroque palace , but the beauty of the surroundings was marred by a heavy mood on climate accords and testy russia-us relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 07.06.2007 women fleeing eastern germany , leaving men behind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sprinting for the west , jobs and intellectual equals higher education levels and a lack of job opportunities have led many young women to leave eastern germany .
the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "
team earned a vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach joachim löw löw was pleased his tired side ground out the win in their 11th international game of the season .
" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals africa -pipe- 07.06.2007 " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls are the fastest growing group of hiv / aids sufferers , said sharma at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

the european commission wants stronger cooperation between eu countries to standardize entry procedures and give legitimate asylum seekers more rights .
denying multiple requests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini wants to end " asylum shopping " countries such as malta or cyprus , where many refugees enter the eu , are under " a lot of pressure " frattini said .
there needs to be a greater amount of " solidarity " between eu countries he said .
frattini suggested looking for ways to better share the burden of refugees between countries .
the approximately 182,000 people who seek asylum in the eu each year - half as many as in 2002 - are unevenly distributed between countries because entry points are often concentrated in southern europe while northern european countries often have more liberal asylum policies .
only a few countries , such as sweden , finland and the netherlands will accept asylum-seekers from other eu countries .
that must change so that there are uniform criteria , he said .
" we need a fair and effective system to deal with these people , " frattini said .
granting more rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif now lives in stockholm but the proposal goes beyond regularizing entry into the eu .
frattini wants to give recognized asylum seekers who have lived in the eu for at least five years more rights .
they should be able to travel within the eu and should be able to have a work permit as long as they fulfil certain conditions , such as having a regular income and health insurance .
it 's unfair that in 2003 the eu granted such rights only to legal immigrants and not to integrated refugees , frattini said .
sensitive issue for eu countries member states remain reluctant to cede power to the commission on asylum and immigration issues since the question touches on the sensitive concepts of citizenship and nationhood .
european refugee organizations welcomed the commission 's plan as a shift away from the current approach of " deterrence and responsibility-shifting . "
" europe needs ... to share responsibility for refugee protection fairly between member states , as well as with the rest of the world , " said the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre . -rrb-
germany typically accepts only a few thousand asylum-seekers each year .
in comparison , sweden granted more than 22,000 requests , many of them from iraqis fleeing the war in their home country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on changes to asylum laws chancellor merkel 's government agreed to several changes in the way the country deals with foreigners , including giving more rights to refugees who have lived in germany for years without official status .

germany 's national team has a five point lead in group d. thomas hitzlsperger 's said he was delighted his goal late in the first half sealed a 2-1 win over slovakia on wednesday .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder 's well-placed header two minutes from the break was his first goal since last september , when he netted in germany 's 13-0 slaughter of san marino .
the win at hamburg 's aol arena takes germany to 19 points at the top of group d , five points clear of the czech republic in second .
it leaves german coach joachim löw 's side in pole position to qualify for next june 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
hitzlsperger uses head bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas hitzlsperger scored the winning header hitzlsperger , whose midfield dominance played a big part in stuttgart being crowned bundesliga champions last season , said it was unusual for him to score with a header .
" i am usually not one to score with my head , i have only headed two goals before , but i am just pleased to get the winning goal , " said hitzlsperger .
" now we will celebrate a little bit , everybody is glad we have a vacation for the summer . "
germany resume their qualifying campaign against wales in september , and hitzlsperger added : " we had some great games and big victories last year and we have some reasons to celebrate , but the job is not yet over . "

" we showed some good soccer nous , we just lacked the freshness , " he said .
" but the players worked hard and threw everything they had at the slovakian defense .
if you think about what the team has achieved this year , it 's enough to be satisfied with the performances and take some pride . "
germany took the lead after 10 minutes when it looked as though werder bremen 's miroslav klose had finally silenced his domestic press detractors by breaking his goal drought .
klose under pressure bildunterschrift : slovakia 's marek hamsik , right , jumps for a high ball with germany 's bernd schneider klose , who turns 29 on saturday , faced some stinging criticism after failing to score in germany 's 6-0 euro 2008 win over san marino last weekend and the top scorer at last year 's world cup is under pressure to keep his place .
after german defender marcell jansen slid his pass through the visitors ' defense , klose looked to have put his side 1-0 up but replays showed it was slovakian defender jan durica who stabbed the ball home .
slovakia pulled level less than 10 minutes later when germany 's christoph metzelder tried to clear the danger after a superb run from matej krajcik , but only suceeded in putting the ball past his own goalkeeper jens lehmann .
hitzlsperger then gave germany back the lead just two minutes before the break with a header which turned out to be the game winner .
germany came out firing after the break , and captain bernd schneider will miss germany 's next euro 2008 game in wales this september after picking up another yellow card for a loose tackle .
the home side kept up the pressure on the slovakian defense and 21-year-old hot-shot striker mario gomez came on midway through the second half , but he failed to repeat last saturday 's trick of scoring twice as he did in the win over san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2009 . governments , regulators , power exchanges , transmission-system operators and the electricity associations of the participating countries approved a " memorandum of understanding " agreeing on the implementation of a coupled market on wednesday .
" this is a positive step towards a single european energy market , " said energy commissioner piebalgs .
he also suggested it would bring lower prices for consumers , increase security of supply and attract investment in new-generation capacity and transmission infrastructure .
a " tri-market coupling " between belgium , france and netherlands was already established back in november 2006 .
luxembourg and germany decided to join the initiative later .
" this should serve as a role model for the entire european community , " said german economic minister michael glos .
efficient and competitive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unbundling is controversial in germany a single integrated electricity market would make it easier to trade electricity across borders .
for now , not much electricity is sold across the eu - not least because buying electricity from another country is a time consuming operation .
the nation in question first has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
that process is now set to get a lot easier .
" market coupling of short-term electricity markets leads to a more efficient use of interconnection capacities , providing more opportunities for energy suppliers to buy and sell power and to optimize their portfolios , " said one electricity association .
associations also expect greater market integration to lead to enhanced competition , thereby benefiting consumers .
eurelectric , the european electricity industry association , said in a statement that it welcomed the initiative as " an important step towards establishing an integrated electricity market in this region and a major step on the way to a competitive internal european electricity market . "
" it also demonstrates that moves towards market integration can be effectively achieved when the political will is there , " it added .
break-up plan now less likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage caused by storms german companies also hope the new agreement will help prevent the european commission 's planned " ownership unbundling , " which would force them to separate production and distribution wings .
many operators , including german giants rwe and e.on , fear such a move would leave them at risk of falling under the control of non-european firms .

as the g8 summit opens , us president george w. bush will try to reassure his russian counterpart about the us plans to deploy a missile defense system in central europe .
russia needs to calm down , bush said . russia should n't worry about the us plan to deploy a missile defense system in central europe , bush said ahead of a meeting with russian president vladimir putin thursday .
the missile defense system is " not something we should hyperventilate about , " bush said after brief talks with british prime minister tony blair on the sidelines of the group of eight summit .
relations strained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend from missiles outside europe russian-us relations have been steadily worsening since putin said in february that the united states had " imposed itself on other states " and that us dominance in the world was " ruinous . "
recently , us-russian relations have hit a post-cold war low , largely due to the missile issue and us complaints about democracy failings in russia .
the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic , two former soviet bloc states that are now part of nato and the european union infuriated russia .
russia believes it is the anti-missile system 's prime target despite washington 's insistence that the system will merely guard against an attack by an unfriendly state such as north korea or iran .

putin spokesman dmitri peskov said the comment about targeting european cities was " purely hypothetical . "
russia absolutely does not want to seek a confrontation or set off a new cold war , peskov was reported saying on the german news web site tagesschau.de.

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .
under the direction of renowned conductor kent nagano , the munich state opera company will be premiering " alice in wonderland " by korean composer unsuk chin in the course of this year 's event .
from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .
sitting through wagner 's momentous opera 's should be a piece of cake for the fans that have already been on the ticket waiting list for years .
in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

world famous events like the bayreuth and beethoven festivals round out the season . johann sebastian bach 's c major prelude and fugue on thursday will raise the curtain not only on the leipzig festival named for the baroque composer , but on a summer of spectacular classical music events .
the 10-day bach festival features not only works by its namesake but also vocal and instrumental music from across europe .
under the motto " from monteverdi to bach , " the concert programs will emphasize works from the renaissance and baroque periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : js bach lived in leipzig from 1723 until his death in 1750 bach , born in eisenach in 1685 , spent the second half of his life in leipzig where he worked as cantor in the st. thomas church and music director as churches throughout the city .
festival guests have the opportunity to experience bach 's music in the very places he worked and lived .
mozart and prague in würzburg all the way across the country in würzburg , wolfgang amadeus mozart will take center stage at a month-long festival dedicated to the classical composer .
mozart , who was born and died in austria , had no personal connection to the bavarian city of würzburg , but he is celebrated there nonetheless .
in its 86th year , the festival 's guiding motto is " mozart and prague . "
the czech capital 's chamber orchestra will open the event in the würzburg residence , a baroque palace that will host many of the 50 concerts planned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würzburg residence alice in munich germany 's classical music summer continues with the munich opera festival , which opens on june 30 and runs through july 31 .
under the direction of renowned conductor kent nagano , the munich state opera company will be premiering " alice in wonderland " by korean composer unsuk chin in the course of this year 's event .
from bayreuth to bonn opera fans - who have tickets - can head straight from munich to bayreuth on july 25 for the opening of the wagner festival .
unlike most events named for particular composers , this festival limits itself to only works by wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zubin mehta will conduct the israel philharmonic at the beethoven festival the romantic composer 's magnum opus , his four-part " ring " cycle , is a highlight of the month-long festival .
sitting through wagner 's momentous opera 's should be a piece of cake for the fans that have already been on the ticket waiting list for years .
in late summer , the musical winds will pass through bonn when the beethoven festival opens on aug .
24 .
the composer was born in the western german city in 1770 and concert-goers can round out their trip to the former german capital with a stop in beethoven 's birth house .
the month-long festival is rich in variety : it will highlight musicians and composers from this year 's focus country , england , in addition to works by beethoven .
big-name performers like conductor zubin mehta and the israel philharmonic , pianists andras schiff and alfred brendel and conductor paavo järvi will make appearances in bonn .

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

united states president george w. bush is the man g8 protestors love to hate .
us citizens who oppose bush 's policies are increasingly making themselves heard , and europeans are listening . their president is the main hate figure of these g8 protests ; his administration seen as responsible for the lack of commitment to climate change accords , the wars that rage around the world and the eradication of human rights .
george w. bush is not welcome here .
but how are the us citizens who have traveled to demonstrate received ?
" the response we 've had from other protestors has been good , but we really did n't expect anything different , " said minou arjomand , a native new yorker now living in berlin .
" people hear us speaking english with an american accent and they 're all like , ' hey , it 's so cool that you 're here . '
i 'm not sure how many people have actually flown here from the states - it 's expensive and hard to justify in terms of environmental impact - but there are a lot of ex-pat americans from around europe at the g8 . "
understanding the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush is reviled by many g8 protestors only a few years ago , the anti-american feeling in europe arising from the invasion of iraq would have made life very uncomfortable for arjomand and her fellow country folk .
these days , the differentiation between administration and populace is more clearly understood by those outside the us due to a growing anti-war movement and obvious rejection by many of the bush government 's policies towards other global and domestic issues .
" in 2003 , i think a lot of people saw the us as bush - period , " said alix rule , another ex-pat american protesting at the g8 .
" when he was re-elected , okay … that did n't help either but since then there has been a growing opposition to this administration in the united states , not only due to its domestic record and the war but because of the effect it is having on the world . "
growing opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist stands in front of riot police rule said she believes that the growing opposition movement within the united states , one willing to take its beliefs onto the international stage , came of age at the wto summit in seattle in 1999 .
" that really opened the eyes of a lot of people , " she said .
" here were thousands of international protestors demonstrating global issues on us soil .
this was not in some far away country , this was seattle and the problems and injustices being protested had american fingerprints on them .
" now you 've got al gore running around , winning oscars and stuff , " rule said .
" americans are not seen as much as being a nation lacking a social conscience . "
when asked if it was significant that the majority of us protestors in and around rostock have come predominantly from european bases , arjomand said that those americans that choose to live abroad have a wider , more international outlook .
but she added that while at college during the invasion of iraq , mass walkouts of students and high school pupils around the country gave her hope that a new generation of awareness was taking root .
finding a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-g8 activists show their displeasure but is n't that just another example of the educated classes having more knowledge of events and therefore a more informed opinion ?
" you do n't have to go to school to know that war is wasteful and wrong , " rule said .
" not everyone in germany cares if the polar cap melts in their lifetime ; some might not even know that there is a danger of that happening .
people all over the states - rich , poor , white collar , blue collar - are waking up to the fact that we have a place and a responsibility in the world and that what we do matters . "
while the attendance of hundreds of us protestors on the marches is not even an issue for the majority of demonstrators , the german police are not taking any chances that people with a more radical grievance against the united states will be equally tolerant .
the radisson hotel in rostock where a large contingent of us journalists is based has a very visible security presence outside and an almost war-zone-like camaraderie inside .
the beer tab " i think the police protection thing is a little bit of overkill , " said charlie jameson , a freelance photojournalist from washington .
" if any extremists did n't know where all the yanks were before they sure as hell do now . "
if anyone wanted to inflict any damage or injury on americans at the g8 , would n't the civilian contingent be more of a viable target than the president who is even more heavily protected ?
" sure , you never hear about us diplomats getting kidnapped and beheaded , right ? "
jameson said .
" but this is rostock , not baghdad .

action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out . dw-world.de : why are you and your team here at the g8 ?
aditi sharma : we 're here to call the g8 to account for the promises made regarding universal access to prevention , treatment and care for all people living with hiv and aids at the meeting in gleneagles in 2005 .
we are also calling the g8 leaders to account for the reiteration of those pledges made later that year at the world summit .
at both summits , the g8 pledged to increase funding as part of its commitment to universal access by 2010 , but two years on the level of funding is still falling dramatically short , some $ 8 - $ 10 billion -lrb- 5.9 billion to 7.4 billion euros -rrb- short every year .
we will be thoroughly checking every communiqué which comes from the g8 this year and if the targets are not met then we will be holding the g8 responsible for the 8,000 people who have died every day and the 1,200 infected every day since those unfulfilled pledges were made .
what are you hoping from the g8 this year in terms of pledges in the fight against aids ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty often leads women into risky situations , said sharma we have been encouraged by angela merkel 's decision to put hiv / aids on the g8 agenda this year and she has also made a point of highlighting the feminization of aids .
this is a new step as it brings women into the debate .
women bear much of the brunt of hiv / aids around the world .
firstly , women and girls are the fastest growing group of people living with the disease .
nearly 50 percent of adults affected globally are now women .
the stigma attached to an hiv woman could lead to her being thrown out of her home or driven from her village and in some cases denied medical treatment .
secondly , women are the principle care givers for sick family members , meaning that they are increasingly taken out of work or education to do this .
thirdly , women are the most likely victims of sexual violence .
so while we will be hoping that sustainable and viable financial action plans are put into place , we will also be hoping for support in the fight against gender inequality and the multiple discriminations faced by women .
addressing the human rights implications of hiv and violence against women requires action at all levels so we would be looking for policy reforms , community education and the promotion of behavioral change .
also , hiv / aids is intrinsically linked with poverty so increased efforts in debt cancellation and climate change , which will hit africa first and hardest if something isn ’ t done soon , will help to reduce the causes of the disease .
is the g8 focusing on the right kind of support , aid and education or is it just throwing money at the problem in the hope that they can solve it by financial means ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aditi sharma for a start , if they were throwing money at hiv / aids projects then we wouldn ’ t be one to complain .
the fact is , like i said previously , that the level of financial commitment is way below the yearly targets set at gleneagles .
while some countries , the uk in particular , have increased their funding , albeit below the recommended level , others remain stagnant and some , specifically italy , have actually reduced their commitment .
so more money would not be a problem .
what is needed however is for governments to tackle the wider issues such as poverty , the fundamental right to food , people ’ s right to education and the right to health care .
poverty and lack of food can lead women in particular into risky situations such as transactional sex in an attempt to earn money to support the family .
education is the most powerful tool in helping people out of poverty and good basic education is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means of preventing hiv infection .
there should also be a concerted effort to increase the standard and the reach of health care systems .
given the few accomplished goals arising from the last set of promises , how hopeful are you that the g8 will do more than just talk this time ?
the time for talk is over .
it is time for action .
time is running out .
any further delay in meeting the targets set for universal access to retroviral drugs will result in millions of deaths , millions of new infections and catastrophic economic consequences for the poorest nations .
it is time for the world ’ s leaders to stop using hiv / aids commitment statements at these summits as a means of appeasement .
these grand gestures can no longer be used to cover up the fact that world leaders are fiddling while rome burns .
aids is a global emergency and the lack of an adequate response is a catastrophe in itself .

the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups . finding a date in parts of eastern germany can be difficult for a young man these days .
it 's not about a lack of romantic spots to take a young woman , or about cultural norms that might discourage unchaperoned activities ; it 's somewhat more basic than that .
eastern germany has a distinct shortage of women . a new study out by the berlin institute for population and development found that since the 1990s , women in their late teens and twenties have been leaving eastern germany to seek their fortunes elsewhere , often in the western part of the country .
they have often left young men their age behind , leaving an excess of testosterone in many regions along with a host of problems . in some regions of the former east germany , there are only 80 women per 100 men , a situation that the study 's authors say is unique in europe . " there are no such large areas like eastern germany in europe with such a disproportionate sex ratio , " said steffen kröhnert , a social scientist and the lead author of the study . even polar regions in northern sweden and finland do n't have such extreme gender discrepancies , leaving only a few isolated greek islands where the male surplus is greater . education is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern german tend to be better educated than men the study found that education was the main indicator behind the exodus .
women in the region tend to have more education than men do , and want to find work in the service sector .
many men , on the other hand , have gravitated toward manual labor or low-skilled work . young women , from 18 to 29 years old , have shown themselves more willing to pick up stakes and move to areas , largely in the west , where they can find good-paying jobs with their qualifications , and partners they want to settle down with . " women traditionally choose partners of the same or slightly higher educational level , " kröhnert said .
" they ca n't really find that in eastern germany so they go to western germany , find partners there and do n't come back . " the largely rural district of elbe elster in southern brandenburg , about two hours south of berlin , was once home to flourishing textile and furniture industries .
but after the fall of the berlin wall , the region lost 5,000 of its 7,000 industrial jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern state of brandenburg -lrb- in blue -rrb- gottfried richter , a regional administrator there , watched as the factories shut their doors and women , who had made up a large part of the workforce in the region 's two big industrial sectors , found themselves with few job prospects .
much of the other work available is in heavy industry , and largely dominated by men . but women in eastern germany have tended to get better education .
germany 's school system places students around the age of 10 on one of three educational tracks .
in the east , 31 percent of women get on the in the highest , university-bound track .
among men , the number was 21 percent .
twice as many boys as girls drop out of school . " girls have done better in school and had more choices , " said richter , whose wife is a teacher .
" so over the past 10 years , they 've have taken their good report cards and left to find jobs . " the boys , he added , were more likely to stay where their friends were and where they had their roots , even though the unemployment rate there is 19 percent . problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural eastern germany has been especially hit by the female exodus but the male-female imbalance surplus has led to problems , according to the study 's authors , including a new , male-dominated underclass and a regional fall in the birth rate in a country that already has one of the lowest birth rates in europe .
it is estimated that between 1995 and 2005 , around 100,000 fewer babies were born in the region than would have been the case if the imbalance had not existed . the study 's authors placed the stay-behind men in three rough categories . there are the " dedicated doers , " well-qualified , motivated men who could find a job in another region , but did not want to move away from friends and family . the " contented stay-behinds " are content and have very low-expectations regarding career and life .
they tend to have lower educational levels and will probably be dependent on social welfare for their entire lives . the third group is the one that has alarmed the experts .
they are the " resigned and embittered men , " who are generally poorly educated , jobless , and feel disadvantaged in society .
they feel that traditional gender roles – male as breadwinner , woman as housewife – have been turned upside down .
that , in turn , can leads to anger , resentment and even xenophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men without partners or jobs tend to be more receptive to extreme right-wing messages " we believe that a devaluation of the traditional male role leads to men to vote for the far right , " said study author kröhnert . far-right parties in germany , such as the npd and dvu , which have had politicians elected to some eastern state parliaments , tend to stress the traditional role for men and find those who have neither a job nor a partner are more susceptible to their messages . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

known as the black bloc , they see themselves as the ultimate opposition .
other demonstrators blame them for causing new problems . they are the demonized face of the g8 protests , the violent anarchists who are dominating the headlines and shoving the many thousands of peaceful demonstrators to the margins of the media coverage .
they are known collectively as the black bloc and their attendance en masse at the protests this week has been met with trepidation among many who march beside them and those watching for the sidelines . the description of the black bloc in the recent reports of violence in rostock and its surrounding areas insinuates that this is an international organization hell bent on vandalism and property destruction in the name of some anti-capitalist agenda .
it gives the black bloc a greater air of threat to think of it as one malevolent force , an anarchist army under the control of a few powerful autonomists . diverse beliefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dressing , but not thinking alike ?
in fact , the black bloc is a cover-all title for protestors from many different groups with a myriad of aims and tactics who normally join together in an affinity group to carry out one shared aim at a protest .
while those involved in a black bloc within a larger demonstration may have come together to carry out one common act or tactic , the beliefs the individuals hold within that bloc can be quite diverse . " a new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " a black blocker who gave his name as ernesto told dw-world.de.
" we have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been .
millions took to the streets to try and stop the invasion of iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war .
fighting for change is the only way - otherwise we face a future of blind subservience , slavery and control . " taking back power some fifty yards further into the roped off area of the rostock fischereihafen camp where black is the color de jour , a young danish woman known only as lena described her own motivation in slightly different terms . " it is a social justice movement which wants to take the power back … to give it back to the people , " she said .
" the g8 is nothing more than an organized crime family ; the faces may change but the objectives stay the same - money and power .
we are taking the roll of citizen police because these people are criminals and have the real cops in their pockets . " through direct action we intend to expose these criminals for what they are and lift the blinkers from the eyes of the masses . " displays of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars and black-clad people did show up in photos over the weekend while some black blockers believe that this direct action should be of a violent nature , others believe that the power of the bloc comes from its togetherness and its displays of solidarity . " did you see the bloc on saturday ? " asked martin x , a black blocker from berlin .
" before the rocks were thrown , the power was with that congregation of people .
the message was the people themselves . " that black mass stood for solidarity , a revolutionary presence , a visible manifestation of our politics , " he added .
" when direct action is aimed at symbolic targets such as the buildings of multinationals and globalized franchises , i can condone that as a symbolic gesture but for me , the sight of the bloc moving as one is more powerful than the image of a burning car . " troublemakers ? the diversity within the one perceived black bloc is not only ignored by some sectors of the media but is unknown to many of the peaceful , more colorful protestors who march beside the black-clad army .
some tar every demonstrator with the same brush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different approach to dressing for protest " for me there is no justification for the throwing of stones and the fighting of the police , " said andi friedrich , a protestor from berlin on the march to rostock 's laage military airport .
" it achieves nothing more than to turn the story of a thousand peaceful protestors into the story of a few violent idiots . " " you know some have their reasons and that their politics lead them to believe that to fight is the only way to achieve their ends , " said carla , andi 's companion .
" but we have seen what it achieves in reality .
we have seen increased police brutality on innocent people caught up in the chaos ; we have seen tougher restrictions , we have seen the hardening of politicians towards the real issues . " and these again are things we should protest about , but it makes no sense when you consider these new problems have been caused by those who march alongside you for peace and justice .

the high voltage power cable will connect northern ireland 's electricity grid with the republic 's .
it will run between cavan and tyrone .
nie says there is no health risk , but people living in the area of the proposed route are concerned .
biologist roger coghill said there was a lot of evidence on the adverse health effects of living near electric fields .
" the idea that there are no health risks from living near electric fields was dispelled decades ago , " mr coghill said .
" we have substantial evidence in every part of science that there are adverse health effects from exposures .
" anyone who denies that simply has n't read the scientific literature . "
nie said it had not yet finalised its plans for the interconnector , but would be consulting with individuals and communities in the proximity of the proposed route in late june and early july .
" the interconnector will be an important addition to northern ireland 's infrastructure , which will deliver benefits for consumers through both northern ireland and the republic , " the company said .
" without interconnection it is demonstrably the case that there would be less competition , higher electricity prices , less generation from renewable sources , and more blackouts across the island of ireland . "
it said the proposed interconnector project was the culmination of very careful and detailed studies .

marine current turbines -lrb- mct -rrb- said the installation of its seagen commercial energy system at the mouth of strangford lough would begin in august .
the lough has one of the fastest tidal flows in the world .

the turbine is currently at harland and wolff shipyard in belfast .
it will later be taken to the lough by an offshore installation contractor which will drill a single pile into the seabed to anchor the turbine .

mr ashley , who runs the sportsworld chain and lillywhites , is to pay £ 37.6m for the shares - a move that values the club at £ 131m .
last month his company , st james holdings , bought 41.6 % of the club 's shares from sir john hall 's family .
he now has about 70 % of the shares , and needs 75 % to trigger a full takeover .
the newcastle united board has urged other shareholders to accept mr ashley 's 101 pence-per-share offer .
mr shepherd , who is expected to stay on at the club in some capacity , said that mr ashley and his company would be " excellent custodians of newcastle united 's heritage " .
" they will provide the best opportunity for the club to flourish in the future , to the benefit of the company and its fans " , he added .
rich history newcastle have been trying to improve their position in the premiership and fans have been getting increasingly frustrated with the team 's performance .
sam allardyce recently replaced glenn roeder as manager of the club .
it was the third managerial change the magpies have undergone in less than three years .
this season the club finished just five points above the relegation zone , having set a target of a european spot at the start of the campaign .
england forward michael owen is one of newcastle 's top stars the club has a rich history , having won the fa cup on six occasions and the league title four times , but it has failed to win any major silverware for 38 years .
mr ashley will become one of a number of large investors who have been buying stakes in english and scottish football clubs - that have included manchester united , liverpool , aston villa and west ham .
his approach is not the first that has targeted the club .
last year the belgravia group investment fund said it was considering a bid - but then dropped its plans in january , saying it had failed to agree a price and transaction structure .
meanwhile , in december last year , hedge fund polygon tried to take over the club , but pulled out of negotiations a month later .
in october 2006 , newcastle united announced a £ 12m financial annual loss after heavy investment in players and a fall in revenues as a result of its failure to qualify for europe .

mr shepherd , who is expected to stay on at the club in some capacity , said that mr ashley and his company would be " excellent custodians of newcastle united 's heritage " .
" they will provide the best opportunity for the club to flourish in the future , to the benefit of the company and its fans " , he added .
rich history newcastle have been trying to improve their position in the premiership and fans have been getting increasingly frustrated with the team 's performance .
sam allardyce recently replaced glenn roeder as manager of the club .
it was the third managerial change the magpies have undergone in less than three years .
this season the club finished just five points above the relegation zone , having set a target of a european spot at the start of the campaign .
england forward michael owen is one of newcastle 's top stars the club has a rich history , having won the fa cup on six occasions and the league title four times , but it has failed to win any major silverware for 38 years .
mr ashley will become one of a number of large investors who have been buying stakes in english and scottish football clubs - that have included manchester united , liverpool , aston villa and west ham .
his approach is not the first that has targeted the club .
last year the belgravia group investment fund said it was considering a bid - but then dropped its plans in january , saying it had failed to agree a price and transaction structure .
meanwhile , in december last year , hedge fund polygon tried to take over the club , but pulled out of negotiations a month later .
in october 2006 , newcastle united announced a £ 12m financial annual loss after heavy investment in players and a fall in revenues as a result of its failure to qualify for europe .

some hospitals were due to be closed and services centralised under labour proposals for " reconfiguration " , a big issue in the assembly election .
but health service managers said " the tide of change " could not be stopped .
first minister rhodri morgan said the announcement was " an olive branch " to other parties to find a way forward .
mr morgan wrote letters to plaid cymru and the liberal democrats in which he revealed labour 's intentions to review its hospital plans .
in the letter , mr morgan also said that his government would undertake that already agreed changes in district general hospitals would not be implemented until associated community services were in place . "
the fact is that we can not hold back the tide of change " mike ponton , welsh nhs confederation speaking on thursday morning , mr morgan said changes to the health service needed to be made to give the welsh public medical services for the 21st century .
however he said people might need to see " services being brought closer to their home before they will accept some of the services have to move further from home " .
" this is a problem facing health administrations all over the western world , " he said .
" we can not live in wales with second class hospital services . "
he added that he did not think there had been a time in welsh politics when " olive branches had been held out so extensively " to opposition parties to discuss an issue .
plaid health spokeperson helen mary jones said she hoped the announcement was more than just " a stay of execution " and she was happy to take on the challenge of working with labour on the issue .
" it is particularly crucial they have acknowledged people wo n't accept changes to hospital services until they can see services in the community to take their place , " she said .
nick bourne , leader of the welsh conservaties , said he needed some more answers over any reorganisation .
" if it 's simply we 're having a pause and then coming back with it , that 's not good enough , " he added .
hope campaigner jean daniels , who is hoping to keep abergele hospital in conwy open , said the announcement gave them hope .
community leaders hoping to save hm stanley hospital at st asaph from closure said they hoped the review would lead to threatened services at the hospital , which include eye treatment , being retained .
but linda groom , from the llandudno hospital action group which is campaigning to retain coronary and acute services there , warned that the moratorium could simply delay the inevitable .
the welsh nhs confederation - which represents health service management - said mr morgan was right to review its proposals so that community services could be put in place .
but mike ponton , director of the confederation , said any pause in the process of change would have to be short to ensure the delivery of 21st century care to the people of wales .
" the fact is that we can not hold back the tide of change , " he said .
and health expert professor marcus longley said the nhs in wales could not afford to continue as it is now .

some hospitals were due to be closed and services centralised under labour proposals for " reconfiguration " , a big issue in the assembly election .
but health service managers said " the tide of change " could not be stopped .
first minister rhodri morgan said the announcement was " an olive branch " to other parties to find a way forward .
mr morgan wrote letters to plaid cymru and the liberal democrats in which he revealed labour 's intentions to review its hospital plans .
in the letter , mr morgan also said that his government would undertake that already agreed changes in district general hospitals would not be implemented until associated community services were in place .
the fact is that we can not hold back the tide of change mike ponton , welsh nhs confederation speaking on thursday morning , mr morgan said changes to the health service needed to be made to give the welsh public medical services for the 21st century .
however he said people might need to see " services being brought closer to their home before they will accept some of the services have to move further from home " .
" this is a problem facing health administrations all over the western world , " he said .
" we can not live in wales with second class hospital services . "
he added that he did not think there had been a time in welsh politics when " olive branches had been held out so extensively " to opposition parties to discuss an issue .
helen mary jones said a full consultation was needed plaid health spokeperson helen mary jones said she hoped the announcement was more than just " a stay of execution " and she was happy to take on the challenge of working with labour on the issue .

mister cd is the latest berwick street music shop to close after 15 years of trading , mister cd in soho 's berwick street is the latest store to disappear - another victim of music downloads , internet shopping and cd price wars .
" i 'm just waiting for a lawyer to call about the lease , " says owner david killington .
" i 'll probably be here another month , but after that , i 've had enough .
i ca n't manage any more . "
mister cd 's imminent closure marks another chapter in the decline of what used to be renowned as the street with the greatest concentration of record shops in london .
collectors from all over the world flocked to berwick street to look for vinyl rarities in its second-hand shops , while others were tempted by the chance to snap up new cds at low prices .
oasis put berwick street in the album charts in 1995 the street was so well known as a haven for music fans that it even featured on the cover of one of the uk 's all-time best-selling albums - -lrb- what 's the story -rrb- morning glory ? by oasis .
but in the past six months , four shops in the area have already called it a day , while others face an uncertain future .
" people over 35 are still buying cds , but no-one under 35 is , " says mr killington .
" we 're just going the way of technology .
" it 's the same as photo developing .
why pay for photo developing when you can print your own photos at home ?
why buy cds when you can burn your own cds at home ?
" it 's like a pub .
once the old drinkers die off , if you do n't get a new crowd of young drinkers , your pub dies too . "
reckless wrecked across the street from mister cd , one of london 's best sources of rare second-hand lps and cds used to reign supreme .
at its height , reckless records had two branches in berwick street , as well as further outlets in islington and camden .
berwick street 's mix of shops has changed in the past 12 years but as trade declined , the business shrank , until it went into liquidation at the end of january .
zafar chowdhry spent 18 years working for reckless as a soul and dance music specialist .
he says sales began falling in the wake of the 11 september 2001 attacks on the us , which damaged tourism .
" after that , the digital age started affecting us , ebay too .
instead of people coming in to us , they were selling things privately or they were downloading things .
" the strength of the pound made a difference .
we used to get so many japanese tourists and they stopped coming .
" hip hop used to be king : we used to be able to sell it all the time .
but it 's incredible how records we used to sell for £ 20 a time now go for about £ 3 to £ 4 .
" a lot of people that grew up with the records have got older and their priorities have changed , or they already had those records .
the newer generation just was n't interested in that kind of thing or the soul , jazz , jazz-funk kind of music . "
promo no-no wider changes in the music industry have also worked against the business model of second-hand record shops .
many dealers used to rely on a steady flow of promotional copies of new releases , sold to them by music journalists and djs in defiance of the " not for resale " warning stamped on each one .
reckless ceased trading after a slump in sales but these days , many record labels no longer provide review copies for the music press and send out mp3 files instead .
" record companies would have a band they would push .
they would put out a lot of promos and send them out to as many djs as they could , " says mr chowdhry .
" we used to get so many promos of some records that we would end up turning them down .
the companies just stopped doing it because it was obviously counter-productive .
" many djs would sell the records on to us and we would get them a month or two before the release date .
we used to get a lot of italians and americans looking for the promos and sending them home .
" we had one guy from switzerland who would come in every tuesday - sometimes we would take £ 300 to £ 400 from this guy .
but by the end , it would be more like £ 20 and sometimes he would n't buy anything at all , because there was nothing there any more . "
signs of life ?
other shops that have closed down recently include cd city in berwick street and steve 's sounds in nearby newport court .
some shops are still succeeding despite changing times both offered new cds at bargain prices , until cut-price competition from supermarkets and rent hikes by landlords squeezed them out .
but it 's not all bad news for music lovers .
as that oasis album cover from 1995 shows , the biggest shop in berwick street used to be owned by nottingham-based selectadisc .
in september 2005 , selectadisc abandoned its london store - but neighbouring independent store sister ray took over the premises , with owners neil brown and phil barton vowing not to let " an awful coffee shop " gain a foothold instead .
further down and round the corner , in nearby broadwick street , eclectic dance music outlet sounds of the universe still thrives , with its own soul jazz label releasing everything from brazilian post-punk to compilations of jungle and dubstep .
out in the suburbs , too , the picture is brighter .
beanos of croydon , once the country 's biggest second-hand record shop , spent several months on the brink of complete shutdown , as reported by the bbc news website in december 2006 .
now , however , proprietor david lashmar is preparing to unveil a new idea , beanos marketplace .
on the old store 's first and second floors , an indoor market of small-scale traders will operate from individual stalls , while a slimmed-down beanos concentrates on true collectors ' rarities on the ground floor .
despite selling off most of its stock , beanos is still in business " we 're trying to reinvent ourselves in the current climate , " says mr lashmar .
" our cd sales have disappeared in the last 18 months , to downloads , and the old stalwarts have bubbled to the top again .
" we 're selling vinyl , we 're selling real records again , and we 're selling our cds for much less than we used to .
" the very rare records will always continue to sell and there 's a huge demand now worldwide for those .
" i 'm really scared about berwick street because i use it as a barometer of the business , with huge respect .
it was a great area and it is dissolving in front of my eyes at the moment .
that scares me and i do n't want to copy whatever mistakes have been made in that area . "
clearly life is not about to get any easier for record shops .
back at mister cd , david killington jokingly suggests that record dealers should be protected in the same way as listed buildings .
" we should be listed - not the buildings , but the people , " he says .
" because once we 're gone , there ai n't gonna be anyone new . "

beanos of croydon , once the country 's biggest second-hand record shop , spent several months on the brink of complete shutdown , as reported by the bbc news website in december 2006 .
now , however , proprietor david lashmar is preparing to unveil a new idea , beanos marketplace .
on the old store 's first and second floors , an indoor market of small-scale traders will operate from individual stalls , while a slimmed-down beanos concentrates on true collectors ' rarities on the ground floor .
despite selling off most of its stock , beanos is still in business " we 're trying to reinvent ourselves in the current climate , " says mr lashmar .
" our cd sales have disappeared in the last 18 months , to downloads , and the old stalwarts have bubbled to the top again .
" we 're selling vinyl , we 're selling real records again , and we 're selling our cds for much less than we used to .
" the very rare records will always continue to sell and there 's a huge demand now worldwide for those .
" i 'm really scared about berwick street because i use it as a barometer of the business , with huge respect .
it was a great area and it is dissolving in front of my eyes at the moment .
that scares me and i do n't want to copy whatever mistakes have been made in that area . "
clearly life is not about to get any easier for record shops .
back at mister cd , david killington jokingly suggests that record dealers should be protected in the same way as listed buildings .
" we should be listed - not the buildings , but the people , " he says .
" because once we 're gone , there ai n't gonna be anyone new . "

mister cd is the latest berwick street music shop to close after 15 years of trading , mister cd in soho 's berwick street is the latest store to disappear - another victim of music downloads , internet shopping and cd price wars .
" i 'm just waiting for a lawyer to call about the lease , " says owner david killington .
" i 'll probably be here another month , but after that , i 've had enough .
i ca n't manage any more . "
mister cd 's imminent closure marks another chapter in the decline of what used to be renowned as the street with the greatest concentration of record shops in london .
collectors from all over the world flocked to berwick street to look for vinyl rarities in its second-hand shops , while others were tempted by the chance to snap up new cds at low prices .
oasis put berwick street in the album charts in 1995 the street was so well known as a haven for music fans that it even featured on the cover of one of the uk 's all-time best-selling albums - -lrb- what 's the story -rrb- morning glory ? by oasis .
but in the past six months , four shops in the area have already called it a day , while others face an uncertain future .
" people over 35 are still buying cds , but no-one under 35 is , " says mr killington .
" we 're just going the way of technology .
" it 's the same as photo developing .
why pay for photo developing when you can print your own photos at home ?
why buy cds when you can burn your own cds at home ?
" it 's like a pub .
once the old drinkers die off , if you do n't get a new crowd of young drinkers , your pub dies too . "
reckless wrecked across the street from mister cd , one of london 's best sources of rare second-hand lps and cds used to reign supreme .
at its height , reckless records had two branches in berwick street , as well as further outlets in islington and camden .
berwick street 's mix of shops has changed in the past 12 years but as trade declined , the business shrank , until it went into liquidation at the end of january .
zafar chowdhry spent 18 years working for reckless as a soul and dance music specialist .
he says sales began falling in the wake of the 11 september 2001 attacks on the us , which damaged tourism .
" after that , the digital age started affecting us , ebay too .
instead of people coming in to us , they were selling things privately or they were downloading things .
" the strength of the pound made a difference .
we used to get so many japanese tourists and they stopped coming .
" hip hop used to be king : we used to be able to sell it all the time .
but it 's incredible how records we used to sell for £ 20 a time now go for about £ 3 to £ 4 .
" a lot of people that grew up with the records have got older and their priorities have changed , or they already had those records .
the newer generation just was n't interested in that kind of thing or the soul , jazz , jazz-funk kind of music . "
promo no-no wider changes in the music industry have also worked against the business model of second-hand record shops .
many dealers used to rely on a steady flow of promotional copies of new releases , sold to them by music journalists and djs in defiance of the " not for resale " warning stamped on each one .
reckless ceased trading after a slump in sales but these days , many record labels no longer provide review copies for the music press and send out mp3 files instead .
" record companies would have a band they would push .
they would put out a lot of promos and send them out to as many djs as they could , " says mr chowdhry .
" we used to get so many promos of some records that we would end up turning them down .
the companies just stopped doing it because it was obviously counter-productive .
" many djs would sell the records on to us and we would get them a month or two before the release date .
we used to get a lot of italians and americans looking for the promos and sending them home .
" we had one guy from switzerland who would come in every tuesday - sometimes we would take £ 300 to £ 400 from this guy .
but by the end , it would be more like £ 20 and sometimes he would n't buy anything at all , because there was nothing there any more . "
signs of life ?
other shops that have closed down recently include cd city in berwick street and steve 's sounds in nearby newport court .
some shops are still succeeding despite changing times both offered new cds at bargain prices , until cut-price competition from supermarkets and rent hikes by landlords squeezed them out .
but it 's not all bad news for music lovers .

a report compiled by six human rights groups listed the names of people who remain unaccounted for after having passed through us custody .
the groups urged the us to stop using secret prisons for terror suspects .
the us last year admitted the existence of such prisons in its " war on terror " but said they were no longer in use .
president george w bush said last september that all secret prison sites were " empty " .
the human rights groups amnesty international cageprisoners center for constitutional rights center for human rights and global justice human rights watch reprieve the groups says they compiled their report , entitled off the record , from government and media sources and from interviews with former prisoners .
" it 's time for the us government to come clean , " said clive stafford smith , legal director of reprieve , one of the groups involved in the appeal .
" these 39 people have been missing for years , and the evidence shows they were in us custody at some point .

rendition flights a spokesman for the cia told the bbc news website that the cia acts " in strict accordance with american law " .
" our counter-terror initiatives - which are subject to careful review and oversight - have been very effective in disrupting plots and saving lives , " said cia spokesman paul gimigliano .
some prisoners were moved from secret sites to guantanamo bay the us administration has faced criticism from legal experts and human rights activists over its policy on detentions of terrorism suspects .
the human rights groups say that people have been arrested in countries including pakistan , iran , iraq , sudan and somalia and flown in " extraordinary renditions " to secret us prisons .
a report approved by a european parliament committee earlier this year said more than 1,000 covert cia flights had crossed european airspace or stopped at european airports in the four years after the 9/11 attacks .
last month , a us civil liberties group sued a subsidiary of boeing for allegedly helping the cia fly suspects to secret overseas detention centres where it says they were subjected to torture and abuse .
three of the organisations - amnesty international , the center for constitutional rights and the international human rights clinic of new york university school of law - have filed a lawsuit under the us freedom of information act for information on the missing people .
' tough ' interrogation human rights watch and cageprisoners are the other two organisations seeking information on the 39 " ghost detainees " .
the groups fears the missing people may have been moved to countries where they might be at risk of torture .
they say children as young as seven are among those detained .
" the duty of governments to protect people from acts of terrorism is not in question , " said claudio cordone of amnesty international .
" but seizing men , women and even children , and placing people in secret locations deprived of the most basic safeguards for any detainees most definitely is . "
in september 2006 , mr bush said 14 detainees had been held at secret cia prisons that used interrogation methods that were " tough " but " lawful and necessary " .
he said the prisoners had since been transferred to the us military prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , and the cia was not holding any more terror suspects .

the mortgage lender says that in may , house prices rose by just 0.3 % , pulling the annual inflation rate down from 10.9 % to 10.6 % .
it said this was clear evidence that the property market was now reacting to the four increases in interest rates since last summer .
the halifax now puts the average uk house price at £ 196,893 .
slowing down may was the second month in a row that the halifax has recorded a slowdown in the pace of annual house price inflation , which reached a recent peak of 11.1 % in march .
" the recent slowing down in monthly house price inflation , together with further evidence of moderation in housing market activity , suggest that the interest rate rises since last summer are having an impact on the market , " said the halifax 's chief economist martin ellis .
the mortgage lender pointed to a continued slide in enquires from new buyers , as reported by estate agents , and the recent drop in new mortgage approvals recorded by the bank of england .
the halifax predicts a further easing of house prices during the year , but mr ellis suggested this would only be moderate .
" solid economic conditions and high employment support housing demand which , together with supply shortages , will continue to support prices , " he said .
the royal institution of chartered surveyors said the housing market slowdown was well and truly underway .
" with mortgage rates continuing to rise , first time buyers are finding it increasingly difficult to afford the massive mortgages they now require to get on the ladder , " said rics economist david stubbs .
" however , if interest rates were to rise to 6 % before the end of the year , a sharper slowdown and a difficult 2008 would be on the cards , " he warned .
more expensive meanwhile a new government financed think-tank has predicted that under current house building plans , houses will eventually cost ten times average salaries in just under 20 years time .
the prediction comes from the national housing and planning advice unit , headed by professor stephen nickell , a former member of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee which sets interest rates each month .
the unit will advise planners and property developers in england .
even though new house building is expected to rise from 168,000 a year in 2006 to 190,000 a year in the next decade , professor nickel says this will be outstripped by the expected growth in household numbers , which is predicted to increase even faster by 223,000 a year up to 2030 .
the centre has forecast that it will become more difficult for those in the bottom quarter of the income distribution to get on the housing ladder in the future .
by dividing the price of the cheapest 25 % of homes by the incomes of the lowest paid 25 % of the population , it predicts that house price affordability will rise to 10 times earnings in 2026 , compared to seven times earnings in 2007 .

us tv network cbs axed the show last month , triggering a protest that culminated in shipments of nuts being sent to the broadcaster .
" wow ! " said cbs entertainment president nina tassler in a letter to the fans .
" you got our attention . "
tassler said seven new episodes of the drama had been ordered , with more to follow if ratings improve .
" we will count on you to rally around the show , to recruit new viewers with the same grass-roots energy , intensity and volume you have displayed in recent weeks , " said tassler .
" ps .
please stop sending us nuts . "
' incredible ' jericho is set in a kansas town whose residents have survived a series of nuclear explosions throughout the us .
the show launched last autumn to positive reviews and encouraging ratings .
after it returned from a three-month mid-season break , however , its viewing figures plummeted , prompting cbs to cancel the show .
the decision enraged fans , who started a letter-writing campaign . "
ps .
please stop sending us nuts " cbs 's nina tassler , in a letter to jericho fans after the season finale , in which one of the characters responds to a demand by saying " nuts " , protesters also began sending peanuts to cbs offices .
according to the nuts for jericho campaign website , about 18,000 kg of nuts were delivered before the network capitulated .
deals with cast members , including star skeet ulrich , had to be completed before cbs could announce its decision .
on hearing of their victory , fans rushed to the website to congratulate each other .
" holy brazil nuts !
incredible !
this is unbelievable ! " wrote one .
" fans , you have done this !
cbs , you have done this !
we love you ! "

the carnegie mellon study looked at what shoppers do when they are told what sites do with personal data .
it suggests that shoppers will pay a premium equal to about $ 0.60 -lrb- 30p -rrb- on goods worth $ 15 -lrb- £ 7 -rrb- if they are reassured about privacy .
the study was used to evaluate a tool that aims to give web users clearer information about privacy policies .
poor choices before now , many studies have shown that many web users fear that the information they must surrender to buy goods and services online will be abused by some shops .
at the least , users fear their contact details will be passed on to marketing firms without their permission .
many also worry about what is being done with credit card or bank details they hand over to make purchases .
despite these fears many shoppers often made poor choices by surrendering valuable personal information if they thought they were getting low prices , said lorrie cranor , director of the usable privacy and security lab at carnegie mellon and lead author on the study .
" our suspicion was that people care about their privacy , but that it 's often difficult for them to get information about a website 's privacy policies , " ms cranor said .
the small study of 72 shoppers looked at how their behaviour changed if they were armed with a tool which showed how good a site 's privacy policy was .
the study used a tool called the platform for privacy preferences -lrb- p3p -rrb- developed by the world wide web consortium to make it easier for the average net user to assess privacy policies .
the p3p tool tries to give consistent information about privacy policies across sites .
however , it is currently only used by about 20 % of e-commerce sites .
the results of the study suggest that people will turn toward sites with " high privacy " ratings and that they would pay slightly extra for that reassurance .

the small study of 72 shoppers looked at how their behaviour changed if they were armed with a tool which showed how good a site 's privacy policy was .
the study used a tool called the platform for privacy preferences -lrb- p3p -rrb- developed by the world wide web consortium to make it easier for the average net user to assess privacy policies .
the p3p tool tries to give consistent information about privacy policies across sites .

the carnegie mellon study looked at what shoppers do when they are told what sites do with personal data .
it suggests that shoppers will pay a premium equal to about $ 0.60 -lrb- 30p -rrb- on goods worth $ 15 -lrb- £ 7 -rrb- if they are reassured about privacy .
the study was used to evaluate a tool that aims to give web users clearer information about privacy policies .
poor choices before now , many studies have shown that many web users fear that the information they must surrender to buy goods and services online will be abused by some shops .
at the least , users fear their contact details will be passed on to marketing firms without their permission .
many also worry about what is being done with credit card or bank details they hand over to make purchases .
despite these fears many shoppers often made poor choices by surrendering valuable personal information if they thought they were getting low prices , said lorrie cranor , director of the usable privacy and security lab at carnegie mellon and lead author on the study .
" our suspicion was that people care about their privacy , but that it 's often difficult for them to get information about a website 's privacy policies , " ms cranor said .
the small study of 72 shoppers looked at how their behaviour changed if they were armed with a tool which showed how good a site 's privacy policy was .
the study used a tool called the platform for privacy preferences -lrb- p3p -rrb- developed by the world wide web consortium to make it easier for the average net user to assess privacy policies .
the p3p tool tries to give consistent information about privacy policies across sites .
however , it is currently only used by about 20 % of e-commerce sites .
the results of the study suggest that people will turn toward sites with " high privacy " ratings and that they would pay slightly extra for that reassurance .

multilingual domains stymied by lobby groups within icann imagine if each time a british internet user entered an e-mail or website address , they would be required to include a chinese or cyrillic character .
for millions of non-english speakers around the world , this is precisely what they experience when they use the internet as the domain name system is unable to fully accommodate their local language .
since their inception , domain names have been largely confined to ascii text , based on a roman character set used in the english language .
while this works well for people familiar with those characters , thousands of other language characters - from french accents to the greek alphabet to japanese kanji - are not represented .
indifference and hostility this creates a significant access barrier for non-english speakers , who are forced to use the roman characters for most aspects of their internet addressing .
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the agency responsible for administering the domain name system , has long pledged to remedy this issue by creating " internationalised domain names " -lrb- more appropriately described as multilingual domain names -rrb- .
indeed , nearly seven years ago the icann board passed a resolution recognising " that it is important that the internet evolve to be more accessible to those who do not use the ascii character set . "
notwithstanding its stated commitment to multilingual domains , the issue has languished , a victim of indifference and even occasional hostility from icann leadership .
growing impatience the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve michael geist last year , after a group of developing countries emphasised the need for faster progress on the issue , icann president and ceo paul twomey warned that " if we get this wrong we could very easily and permanently break the internet . "
multilingual domains have also been stymied by opposition from the trademark community , a powerful lobby group within the icann system which fears that the introduction of new language characters will lead to market confusion and a proliferation of cybersquatting disputes .
icann has repeatedly struck committees , held workshops , and introduced guidelines , yet there has been little to show for the efforts .
governments have become increasingly impatient with the lack of progress .
international inaction at the 2005 world summit on the information society , they specifically underlined the need to " advance the process for the introduction of multilingualism in a number of areas including domain names , e-mail addresses and keyword look-up " and to " implement programs that allow for the presence of multilingual domain names and content on the internet to ensure the participation of all in the emerging new society . "
while the international internet community has struggled with the multilingual domain name issue , many countries have prioritised the implementation of local languages within their country-code domain names .
in china multilingual domain names exist within the local domain name system in fact , the strongest indictment of international inaction comes from the experiences elsewhere - china , korea , germany , sweden , greece , and israel are among the dozens of countries that have successfully implemented multilingual domain names within their local domain name system so that internet users can function in their local language when using country-code domains such as dot-cn -lrb- china -rrb- or dot-de -lrb- germany -rrb- even if the international system is still off-limits .
success has not been uniform at the country-code level , however .
locked out for example , the canadian internet registration authority -lrb- cira -rrb- , which manages the dot-ca domain , should pass one million domain name registrations by early 2008 , yet implementation of french language characters is only likely to take place in the next few years .
by august 2006 , the government of quebec decided that it had waited long enough .
in a letter to the cira board -lrb- i was a member of the board at the time -rrb- , it delivered an official request for multilingual domains to allow for the use of french language characters .
most of the non-english speaking world is literally locked out of the domain name system by reason of limitations in language .
with an icann meeting set for later this month in puerto rico , the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve .

multilingual domains stymied by lobby groups within icann imagine if each time a british internet user entered an e-mail or website address , they would be required to include a chinese or cyrillic character .
for millions of non-english speakers around the world , this is precisely what they experience when they use the internet as the domain name system is unable to fully accommodate their local language .
since their inception , domain names have been largely confined to ascii text , based on a roman character set used in the english language .
while this works well for people familiar with those characters , thousands of other language characters - from french accents to the greek alphabet to japanese kanji - are not represented .
indifference and hostility this creates a significant access barrier for non-english speakers , who are forced to use the roman characters for most aspects of their internet addressing .
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the agency responsible for administering the domain name system , has long pledged to remedy this issue by creating " internationalised domain names " -lrb- more appropriately described as multilingual domain names -rrb- .
indeed , nearly seven years ago the icann board passed a resolution recognising " that it is important that the internet evolve to be more accessible to those who do not use the ascii character set . "
notwithstanding its stated commitment to multilingual domains , the issue has languished , a victim of indifference and even occasional hostility from icann leadership .
growing impatience the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve michael geist last year , after a group of developing countries emphasised the need for faster progress on the issue , icann president and ceo paul twomey warned that " if we get this wrong we could very easily and permanently break the internet . "
multilingual domains have also been stymied by opposition from the trademark community , a powerful lobby group within the icann system which fears that the introduction of new language characters will lead to market confusion and a proliferation of cybersquatting disputes .
icann has repeatedly struck committees , held workshops , and introduced guidelines , yet there has been little to show for the efforts .
governments have become increasingly impatient with the lack of progress .
international inaction at the 2005 world summit on the information society , they specifically underlined the need to " advance the process for the introduction of multilingualism in a number of areas including domain names , e-mail addresses and keyword look-up " and to " implement programs that allow for the presence of multilingual domain names and content on the internet to ensure the participation of all in the emerging new society . "
while the international internet community has struggled with the multilingual domain name issue , many countries have prioritised the implementation of local languages within their country-code domain names .
in china multilingual domain names exist within the local domain name system in fact , the strongest indictment of international inaction comes from the experiences elsewhere - china , korea , germany , sweden , greece , and israel are among the dozens of countries that have successfully implemented multilingual domain names within their local domain name system so that internet users can function in their local language when using country-code domains such as dot-cn -lrb- china -rrb- or dot-de -lrb- germany -rrb- even if the international system is still off-limits .
success has not been uniform at the country-code level , however .
locked out for example , the canadian internet registration authority -lrb- cira -rrb- , which manages the dot-ca domain , should pass one million domain name registrations by early 2008 , yet implementation of french language characters is only likely to take place in the next few years .
by august 2006 , the government of quebec decided that it had waited long enough .
in a letter to the cira board -lrb- i was a member of the board at the time -rrb- , it delivered an official request for multilingual domains to allow for the use of french language characters .
most of the non-english speaking world is literally locked out of the domain name system by reason of limitations in language .
with an icann meeting set for later this month in puerto rico , the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve .

multilingual domains stymied by lobby groups within icann imagine if each time a british internet user entered an e-mail or website address , they would be required to include a chinese or cyrillic character .
for millions of non-english speakers around the world , this is precisely what they experience when they use the internet as the domain name system is unable to fully accommodate their local language .
since their inception , domain names have been largely confined to ascii text , based on a roman character set used in the english language .
while this works well for people familiar with those characters , thousands of other language characters - from french accents to the greek alphabet to japanese kanji - are not represented .
indifference and hostility this creates a significant access barrier for non-english speakers , who are forced to use the roman characters for most aspects of their internet addressing .
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the agency responsible for administering the domain name system , has long pledged to remedy this issue by creating " internationalised domain names " -lrb- more appropriately described as multilingual domain names -rrb- .
indeed , nearly seven years ago the icann board passed a resolution recognising " that it is important that the internet evolve to be more accessible to those who do not use the ascii character set . "
notwithstanding its stated commitment to multilingual domains , the issue has languished , a victim of indifference and even occasional hostility from icann leadership .
growing impatience the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve michael geist last year , after a group of developing countries emphasised the need for faster progress on the issue , icann president and ceo paul twomey warned that " if we get this wrong we could very easily and permanently break the internet . "
multilingual domains have also been stymied by opposition from the trademark community , a powerful lobby group within the icann system which fears that the introduction of new language characters will lead to market confusion and a proliferation of cybersquatting disputes .
icann has repeatedly struck committees , held workshops , and introduced guidelines , yet there has been little to show for the efforts .
governments have become increasingly impatient with the lack of progress .
international inaction at the 2005 world summit on the information society , they specifically underlined the need to " advance the process for the introduction of multilingualism in a number of areas including domain names , e-mail addresses and keyword look-up " and to " implement programs that allow for the presence of multilingual domain names and content on the internet to ensure the participation of all in the emerging new society . "
while the international internet community has struggled with the multilingual domain name issue , many countries have prioritised the implementation of local languages within their country-code domain names .
in china multilingual domain names exist within the local domain name system in fact , the strongest indictment of international inaction comes from the experiences elsewhere - china , korea , germany , sweden , greece , and israel are among the dozens of countries that have successfully implemented multilingual domain names within their local domain name system so that internet users can function in their local language when using country-code domains such as dot-cn -lrb- china -rrb- or dot-de -lrb- germany -rrb- even if the international system is still off-limits .
success has not been uniform at the country-code level , however .
locked out for example , the canadian internet registration authority -lrb- cira -rrb- , which manages the dot-ca domain , should pass one million domain name registrations by early 2008 , yet implementation of french language characters is only likely to take place in the next few years .
by august 2006 , the government of quebec decided that it had waited long enough .
in a letter to the cira board -lrb- i was a member of the board at the time -rrb- , it delivered an official request for multilingual domains to allow for the use of french language characters .
most of the non-english speaking world is literally locked out of the domain name system by reason of limitations in language .
with an icann meeting set for later this month in puerto rico , the time has come to prioritise linguistic diversity on the internet by giving multilingual domains the attention they deserve .

this world enters a world of paranoia and fear , following some of the thousands of zimbabweans who enter south africa illegally every week .
they are running from the political and economic crisis in their country .
some are fleeing for their lives , victims of the mugabe government 's violent political crackdown .
but even in south africa they can not escape the terror of the regime .
death squad rumours many live in fear of zimbabwe 's feared central intelligence organisation -lrb- cio -rrb- - the country 's secret police who are widely suspected by dissidents of conducting surveillance operations outside zimbabwe 's border .
rumours of death squads and kidnappings are rife .
this world speaks to refugees living in the shadow of this fear , and one young man who fled zimbabwe after being reluctantly drafted into the cio .
he claims the training involved being shown how to torture using batons and electric wires .
he also says he escaped from zimbabwe , and that he was followed by cio agents who have been trying to take him back to zimbabwe .
as they try to separate fact from fiction , events conspire to make this world believe that they too , might be under surveillance .

the virgin voyager has been modified to run on eco-friendly fuel and the company is aiming to convert more in the future .
the train uses a blended fuel which is 20 % biodiesel - to reduce co2 emissions without harming the engine .
the london-to-llandudno passenger train left on thursday morning .
the journey was launched by prime minister-in-waiting gordon brown .
biodiesel is a processed fuel derived from biological sources including rapeseed , soyabean and palm oil .
it is biodegradable and produces less co2 than conventional diesel .
during a six-month trial , the train will run from birmingham to scotland , across south wales , north east england , the north west , the west country , the south west and the south coast .

virgin boss richard branson said the environmental impact was equivalent to taking 23,000 cars off the road at the launch , sir richard said : " it 's fantastic that we are leading the rest of europe in developing this fuel . "
he added that it was bizarre that the tax on clean fuels was higher than on dirty fuels .
" our indications are from gordon brown that he will address this problem .
if it is not addressed , we will have dirty fuels and the clean fuels will head abroad to countries such as france and germany instead . "
he said the company hoped in future to use 100 % biodiesel - equivalent to removing 100,000 vehicles from the road .
speaking ahead of the launch , mr brown said : " i want britain to be a world leader in the development and use of environmentally-friendly fuels .
