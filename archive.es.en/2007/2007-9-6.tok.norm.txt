had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .
the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .
the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
all three are thought to have been connected through a radical mosque and now-defunct multicultural center .
they also allegedly trained at terrorist camps in pakistan .
german authorities are currently searching for 10 other suspects believed to have been involved in the plot . radicalism in ulm nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide , the bombs ' base , has deadly potential when mixed with other chemicals authorities said they are puzzled by why the region has been a magnet for radical muslims .
two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .

one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .
the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
all three are thought to have been connected through a radical mosque and now-defunct multicultural center .
they also allegedly trained at terrorist camps in pakistan .
german authorities are currently searching for 10 other suspects believed to have been involved in the plot . radicalism in ulm nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide , the bombs ' base , has deadly potential when mixed with other chemicals authorities said they are puzzled by why the region has been a magnet for radical muslims .
two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .
terror a threat inside germany as the latest attack has made clear , germany , like several other western countries , has a homegrown group of islamists on its hands , according to german interior minister wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military installations in germany were suspected to be among the bombs ' targets " the danger that international terrorism represents is a reality not only for the soldiers , police and personnel charged with the reconstruction in afghanistan ... but also inside our own country , " he said . the british " shoe bomber " richard reid , the " american taliban " john walker lindh , jailed in 2002 for fighting with afghan militia against us troops , and australian david hicks , the first man convicted of supporting terrorism by a us military court at guantanamo bay , are among the other cases of western nationals accused of supporting terrorism . " one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but some are susceptible .
these are dangerous , fanatical people with high criminal energy . " germany has avoided major attacks while germany has been spared attacks such as deadly bombings in spain and great britain , terrorist have been operating in the country for a number of years .
several of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 attacks , including the ringleader mohammed atta , were involved in the islamist scene in hamburg .
germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .
the suspects were believed to have been motivated by caricatures of the prophet mohammed printed in european newspapers . german chancellor angela merkel said investigators must remain vigilant , adding that the thwarted plot shows that attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat .

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .

the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .

another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .

" one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but some are susceptible .
these are dangerous , fanatical people with high criminal energy . " germany has avoided major attacks while germany has been spared attacks such as deadly bombings in spain and great britain , terrorist have been operating in the country for a number of years .
several of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 attacks , including the ringleader mohammed atta , were involved in the islamist scene in hamburg .
germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .
the suspects were believed to have been motivated by caricatures of the prophet mohammed printed in european newspapers . german chancellor angela merkel said investigators must remain vigilant , adding that the thwarted plot shows that attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat .

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .

but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .

schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2007 opinion : germany 's lucky escape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the terror threat is no longer an abstract one in germany , dw 's marcel fürstenau hopes berlin wo n't rush to take the opportunity to shore up support for draconian anti-terrorist measures . this time , germany obviously had a lucky escape .
had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2007 opinion : germany 's lucky escape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the terror threat is no longer an abstract one in germany , dw 's marcel fürstenau hopes berlin wo n't rush to take the opportunity to shore up support for draconian anti-terrorist measures . this time , germany obviously had a lucky escape .
had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .

there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

over half -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- of those interested in emigrating simply said they preferred other countries to their homeland - particularly in southern and western europe .

the allensbach demoscopy institute questioned 883 people for the survey , which was released on wednesday .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .

would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .

" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .
the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
all three are thought to have been connected through a radical mosque and now-defunct multicultural center .
they also allegedly trained at terrorist camps in pakistan .
german authorities are currently searching for 10 other suspects believed to have been involved in the plot . radicalism in ulm nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide , the bombs ' base , has deadly potential when mixed with other chemicals authorities said they are puzzled by why the region has been a magnet for radical muslims .
two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .
terror a threat inside germany as the latest attack has made clear , germany , like several other western countries , has a homegrown group of islamists on its hands , according to german interior minister wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military installations in germany were suspected to be among the bombs ' targets " the danger that international terrorism represents is a reality not only for the soldiers , police and personnel charged with the reconstruction in afghanistan ... but also inside our own country , " he said . the british " shoe bomber " richard reid , the " american taliban " john walker lindh , jailed in 2002 for fighting with afghan militia against us troops , and australian david hicks , the first man convicted of supporting terrorism by a us military court at guantanamo bay , are among the other cases of western nationals accused of supporting terrorism . " one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but some are susceptible .
these are dangerous , fanatical people with high criminal energy . " germany has avoided major attacks while germany has been spared attacks such as deadly bombings in spain and great britain , terrorist have been operating in the country for a number of years .
several of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 attacks , including the ringleader mohammed atta , were involved in the islamist scene in hamburg .
germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2007 opinion : germany 's lucky escape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the terror threat is no longer an abstract one in germany , dw 's marcel fürstenau hopes berlin wo n't rush to take the opportunity to shore up support for draconian anti-terrorist measures . this time , germany obviously had a lucky escape .
had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .

it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .

but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 06.09.2007 eu mulls database for explosives after german terror plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide was meant to be used for bombs by the men arrested in germany after german security officials successfully foiled a plot to attack us installations in the country , the eu has rekindled debate on which counter-terrorism measures are most effective . the same day that german authorities foiled a " massive " attack with the arrest of three islamic extremists allegedly planning to bomb us military facilities in germany , eu justice commissioner franco frattini in brussels unveiled a new package of proposals to tackle terrorism .
" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to have the text finalized next month , despite looming polish elections and british skepticism . european leaders want to have a final treaty text ready for the bloc 's summit to be held in lisbon on oct .
18-19 .
but the compromise reached under the leadership of german chancellor angela merkel in june could be hijacked by the polish election , which is likely to take place on oct .
21 .
poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 06.09.2007 council of europe chief : germany must target racism 's roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis believes far-right parties should be exposed as having little political credibility terry davis , the secretary general of the council of europe , spoke to dw-world.de about the efforts to combat racially motivated violence in germany and the calls by some politicians for the far-right npd to be banned . recent racist attacks in germany and the publication of the european fundamental rights agency 's report into rising violence against minorities have again highlighted the problem of racially motivated crime in europe .
the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
all three are thought to have been connected through a radical mosque and now-defunct multicultural center .
they also allegedly trained at terrorist camps in pakistan .
german authorities are currently searching for 10 other suspects believed to have been involved in the plot . radicalism in ulm nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide , the bombs ' base , has deadly potential when mixed with other chemicals authorities said they are puzzled by why the region has been a magnet for radical muslims .
two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .
terror a threat inside germany as the latest attack has made clear , germany , like several other western countries , has a homegrown group of islamists on its hands , according to german interior minister wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military installations in germany were suspected to be among the bombs ' targets " the danger that international terrorism represents is a reality not only for the soldiers , police and personnel charged with the reconstruction in afghanistan ... but also inside our own country , " he said . the british " shoe bomber " richard reid , the " american taliban " john walker lindh , jailed in 2002 for fighting with afghan militia against us troops , and australian david hicks , the first man convicted of supporting terrorism by a us military court at guantanamo bay , are among the other cases of western nationals accused of supporting terrorism . " one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but some are susceptible .
these are dangerous , fanatical people with high criminal energy . " germany has avoided major attacks while germany has been spared attacks such as deadly bombings in spain and great britain , terrorist have been operating in the country for a number of years .
several of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 attacks , including the ringleader mohammed atta , were involved in the islamist scene in hamburg .
germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .
the suspects were believed to have been motivated by caricatures of the prophet mohammed printed in european newspapers . german chancellor angela merkel said investigators must remain vigilant , adding that the thwarted plot shows that attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat .

had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

"
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .

" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .

in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .

poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .

but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2007 opinion : germany 's lucky escape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the terror threat is no longer an abstract one in germany , dw 's marcel fürstenau hopes berlin wo n't rush to take the opportunity to shore up support for draconian anti-terrorist measures . this time , germany obviously had a lucky escape .
had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "

ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .

lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "

had investigators failed to track down the suspected terrorists in time , the country could have witnessed a tragedy on a similar scale to those in london in 2005 and madrid in 2004 , which together claimed hundreds of innocent lives .
germany was spared this fate thanks to the efficient and professional work of the police and security services .
for this , they deserve the sort of praise and recognition they are often denied , given that the bulk of their difficult and dangerous work tends to take place out of the public eye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests marked germany 's first victory in the fight on terror .
perhaps that 's because it 's the first time that terrorist plans had taken on such concrete shape .
in the past , the terrorist threat has been less advanced and more abstract , with warnings of imminent attacks - thankfully - proving unfounded .
it raises the question whether some people just wanted shore up support for unpopular plans to tighten anti-terror measures .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble can not be accused of this in the current case .
the leads were unambiguous , the charges specific : training in a terror camp in pakistan , 730 kilograms of chemicals , a house rented in central germany under a false name and much more .
no politician or law enforcement officials would make up these things at the risk of losing his job .
schäuble , a member of the conservative cdu , could n't resist the opportunity to renew his calls for police-controlled spying of private computers to combat terrorism . his detractors responded by pointing to the fact that the arrests were possible without the controversial computer surveillance , which most parties broadly reject .
one could put it this way : suspected terrorists were caught without the state needing to infringe civil rights .
of course it 's possible to say that this particular victory would never have been possible without the tightened security laws in place since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but because of the criminal investigation , the public will probably never know this for sure .
the debate surrounding the ethics of counter-terrorism measures will therefore most certainly not end here .
there 's one thing the germans know for sure now , however : they are a target of international terrorism .
since the potential perpetrators are not only foreigners , but also apparently include young germans that have converted to islam , the security situation likely got more complex .
the situation , one has to fear , is more dangerous than ever .
hopefully , politicians and the media will deal sensitively with this development .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .
the roots of this problem lie elsewhere and not just in the manifesto of a right-wing political party . nick amies interviewed terry davis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to have the text finalized next month , despite looming polish elections and british skepticism . european leaders want to have a final treaty text ready for the bloc 's summit to be held in lisbon on oct .

but the compromise reached under the leadership of german chancellor angela merkel in june could be hijacked by the polish election , which is likely to take place on oct .

" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .
besides discussing treaty issues friday , european foreign ministers will also meet wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative along with the us and russia to discuss the future status of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo .
on saturday , the ministers will begin preparing for an eu-russia summit in portugal scheduled for oct .

they hope to have the text finalized next month , despite looming polish elections and british skepticism . european leaders want to have a final treaty text ready for the bloc 's summit to be held in lisbon on oct .
18-19 .
but the compromise reached under the leadership of german chancellor angela merkel in june could be hijacked by the polish election , which is likely to take place on oct .
21 .
poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , who serve as president and prime minister , almost derailed the eu treaty in june during the german eu summit by demanding changes in the bloc 's voting procedures . timetable to remain unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said he is confident a deal will be reached eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he remained confident wednesday that the timetable would be met and said he sees no reason why poland would n't " stick to its commitments . "
" we hope it can be concluded during the october summit , " he told reporters .
" even if there are elections in poland there should be no reason to postpone it . "
britain 's andrew duff , one of three european parliamentarians who will take part in the discussions with eu foreign ministers at viana do castelo in northern portugal on friday , said he was unsure of how poland 's political situation would play out .
while poland could approve a deal in lisbon " the concerns are there " regarding the country 's political will to do so , he told the afp news agency . poland a big unknown in treaty talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's position remains unclear to some in brussels poland has not asked to postpone the talks or put off the conclusion of the treaty , and it 's unclear how the collapse of their ruling coalition will affect treaty talks .
eu diplomats are also worried that the nationalist rhetoric sure to come with a polish political campaign could effect treaty negotiations .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said she would not rule out the possibility that elections in poland could present a problem for the eu .
" in a normal situation , to adopt a coherent position on the treaty requires a strong government , " she said monday .
" but we will see how things pan out . " major parties have agreed to treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french voted " non " in the last referendum a recent opinion poll showed that the law and justice party had an early lead over the more pro-european center-right civic platform .
european parliament president hans-gert pöttering said since the two big polish opposition parties supported the treaty , there was no reason not to reach a political agreement in october .
" everyone has to keep his word and the polish elections do n't change the need to stick to the commitment made in june , " he said at a news conference .
but it 's not only poland that could prove a problem for the treaty , which would simplify the bloc 's operation by creating a foreign policy chief and alter the system of a rotating presidency , which portugal currently holds . britain could demand a treaty vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratifying the constitution might run into problems if the eu manages to put together a treaty by the end of 2007 , it will still need to be ratified by the eu 's 27 member countries .
there 's some worry that the ratification process will run into similar problems as the constitutional ratification in 2005 , when french and dutch voters rejected the draft constitution .
in great britain , political leaders from all three main political parties launched a campaign thursday to demand a referendum on the eu reform treaty .
current polls show a british referendum would likely produce a " no " vote , which could plunge the bloc into another political crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 06.09.2007 eu mulls database for explosives after german terror plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide was meant to be used for bombs by the men arrested in germany after german security officials successfully foiled a plot to attack us installations in the country , the eu has rekindled debate on which counter-terrorism measures are most effective . the same day that german authorities foiled a " massive " attack with the arrest of three islamic extremists allegedly planning to bomb us military facilities in germany , eu justice commissioner franco frattini in brussels unveiled a new package of proposals to tackle terrorism .
" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three men arrested wednesday in a terrorist plot were connected through the city 's islamic information center , authorities said . ulm and neu-ulm , cities on the border between the southern states of baden-württemberg and bavaria , have long been viewed by authorities as a primary breeding ground for terrorists in germany .
the area is back in the spotlight after three men believed to be part of the " ulm scene " were arrested wednesday .
the men were allegedly planning a " massive " attack against us targets in germany , including military facilities , according to monika harms , germany 's federal prosecutor . two suspects homegrown radicals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ulm cathedral has the tallest gothic tower in the world fritz g. , a german convert to islam , has been identified by prosecutors as the plot 's probable ringleader .
the 28-year-old was a resident in neu-ulm at the time of his arrest .
fritz g. was taken into custody along with daniel s. , a 21-year-old german , and adem y. , a 28-year-old turk in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
all three are thought to have been connected through a radical mosque and now-defunct multicultural center .
they also allegedly trained at terrorist camps in pakistan .
german authorities are currently searching for 10 other suspects believed to have been involved in the plot . radicalism in ulm nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen peroxide , the bombs ' base , has deadly potential when mixed with other chemicals authorities said they are puzzled by why the region has been a magnet for radical muslims .
two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .
terror a threat inside germany as the latest attack has made clear , germany , like several other western countries , has a homegrown group of islamists on its hands , according to german interior minister wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military installations in germany were suspected to be among the bombs ' targets " the danger that international terrorism represents is a reality not only for the soldiers , police and personnel charged with the reconstruction in afghanistan ... but also inside our own country , " he said . the british " shoe bomber " richard reid , the " american taliban " john walker lindh , jailed in 2002 for fighting with afghan militia against us troops , and australian david hicks , the first man convicted of supporting terrorism by a us military court at guantanamo bay , are among the other cases of western nationals accused of supporting terrorism . " one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but some are susceptible .
these are dangerous , fanatical people with high criminal energy . " germany has avoided major attacks while germany has been spared attacks such as deadly bombings in spain and great britain , terrorist have been operating in the country for a number of years .
several of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 attacks , including the ringleader mohammed atta , were involved in the islamist scene in hamburg .
germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .
the suspects were believed to have been motivated by caricatures of the prophet mohammed printed in european newspapers . german chancellor angela merkel said investigators must remain vigilant , adding that the thwarted plot shows that attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat .

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .
many now feel that the cdu is exploiting this week 's arrests to push through their proposals , when in fact , the success of the operation proved that existing surveillance measures are adequate .
" the success of the investigating bodies shows that terrorist activities can be squashed in the early stages , without the need for measures such as those proposed by schäuble , " said peter struck , social democratic party parliamentary leader . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high , " frattini said .
" there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down . "
addressing the european parliament in strasbourg , frattini stressed that it was crucial to " strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is first , right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights . "
the proposals include the creation of an " explosives database " at europol ; an eu-wide rapid alert system on lost and stolen explosives and a bloc-wide air passengers name recording system similar to the us database on european air passengers .
" the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the union , " the commissioner said .
" the union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the united states . "
criminalizing internet misuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the emergence of terrorist networks a further proposal foresees making any posting of bomb-making information on the internet a criminal offense .
the net " is being misused by terrorists , " frattini said .
" we all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much , or even more so , as ordinary citizens - for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terror attacks . "
his call for stronger cooperation among eu states in combating terrorism and religious extremism met with broad agreement among meps , but there were differences on what exactly the measures should be , with many concerned about the balance between security legislation and civil liberties .
ban on carry-on liquids on planes to stay the same day , transport commissioner jacques barrot rejected calls from the european parliament to drop rigid rules on liquids being taken aboard european flights , citing the arrests in germany as proof that terrorism is an ongoing threat , said afp .
" the commission is conscious of the inconvenience caused to passengers and airports by -lrb- this -rrb- rule ... but as events of the last few months in britain and the last few days in denmark and germany show , the threat of terrorism in europe remains a reality , " barrot said in a statement .
lawmakers in strasbourg earlier on wednesday had called for the liquid aboard planes rule to be abrogated , arguing that the rules caused " substantial inconvenience and disruption " to passengers and airport operators while doing little to improve security .
despite winning broad cross-party support , the resolution was dismissed by barrot .
" terrorists have not stopped looking for new ways and new techniques to put their destructive plans to work , " he said .
" faced with such threats , europe owes it to itself not to show signs of weakness . "
criticism was also rife in strasbourg over the eu 's failure to fill the bloc 's anti-terrorism post , vacant since march .
the position was created after the attack on madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in march 2004 , but the chair has been empty after previous anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries resigned six month ago .
terror dragnet in the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble 's draconian plans are controversial back in germany , wednesday 's arrests reignited a lingering political debate about the use of online searches .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the christian democrats wants german intelligence services to use online connections to snoop on computer hard disks , on the grounds that the office of criminal investigation can use hacking to track down terrorists .
his calls have broad political backing within his own party , but so far , have been rejected by justice minister brigitte zypries as well other members of the social democrats .

two years ago , bavaria 's interior minister closed the multicultural center in neu-ulm . ten years ago an egyptian physician was under suspicion of collecting funds for islamist radicals .
another man was believed to have connection with the bombing attacks in bali that occurred in 2002 . he left germany voluntarily after the bavarian authorities had deported his son , whom they classified as a " threat . "
officials had found bomb making instructions in his apartment during a raid , but were unable to prove that attacks were being planned .
terror a threat inside germany as the latest attack has made clear , germany , like several other western countries , has a homegrown group of islamists on its hands , according to german interior minister wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military installations in germany were suspected to be among the bombs ' targets " the danger that international terrorism represents is a reality not only for the soldiers , police and personnel charged with the reconstruction in afghanistan ... but also inside our own country , " he said . the british " shoe bomber " richard reid , the " american taliban " john walker lindh , jailed in 2002 for fighting with afghan militia against us troops , and australian david hicks , the first man convicted of supporting terrorism by a us military court at guantanamo bay , are among the other cases of western nationals accused of supporting terrorism . " one would think that someone who grows up here and enjoys the great advantages of our free society is immune , " schäuble told germany 's bild newspaper .

germany had a close call last year when two suitcase bombs left on commuter trains headed to dortmund and koblenz failed to explode because of construction flaws .
the suspects were believed to have been motivated by caricatures of the prophet mohammed printed in european newspapers . german chancellor angela merkel said investigators must remain vigilant , adding that the thwarted plot shows that attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat .

the report stated that incidents of racially motivated violence had increased in at least eight of the european union 's 27 member states in the last six years .
germany was one of these countries .
dw-world.de : the fundamental rights agency 's recent report on racially motivated violence in europe could not have been published at a more appropriate time , coming as it did in the midst of the current spate of attacks in germany .
what were the council of europe 's reactions to the report and the upsurge of violence in germany ?
terry davis : of course the council of europe is very concerned , not only with the fsa report , which shows the increase of racially motivated violence , but with all kinds of violence , hate crime and hate speech in europe .
we are also concerned that the events in germany are , sadly , nothing new .
we released two reports through the european commission for racism and intolerance on germany in the last six years , in 2001 and 2004 , and both were very disappointing .
it 's not that germany is not trying its best to combat racism and racially motivated violence , it 's just that in the last six years , whatever it 's done has n't helped .
there are some politicians in germany who believe the most effective way to curb the violence towards minorities would be to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a former member of the british parliament who campaigned against extremism in your constituency , would you agree that this approach would get the best results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davis campaigned against extremists as a british mp i have been following the debate on banning the npd and see both sides of the argument for and against it .
-lsb- german social democratic party leader -rsb- kurt beck has come out and put a lot of energy into his calls for banning the npd .
one has to realize though that banning the npd would not be the end of it .
banning extremist parties just drive them underground only for them to resurface as new incarnations later .
as a member of parliament in birmingham in the 1970s , i had the national front -lsb- a british far-right party -rsb- campaigning in my constituency .
after efforts to expose them as the racists they were , before engaging them in debate and ridiculing them as a way of belittling their shallow political basis , the nf eventually disappeared .
however , the same people are back playing the same tune as the british national party .
where they used to exploit people 's fears over unemployment , social security etc. as the nf , these people now use the fear of muslims and islam to gain votes .
banning them , just like the npd , would not be enough on its own .
would a ban on the npd deny a section of the population the chance to vote for a party it believes in and supports , effectively infringing the rights of these voters and denying them a democratic right ?
i understand that argument , but we believe that freedom can become license .
if someone takes their right to free speech and uses it to spread hate , there should be laws that prevent that , and action should be taken to correct that .
the european convention on human rights says there must be a balance .
freedom of expression balanced with responsibility .
my personal view is that you should be allowed to voice your views but you must do it responsibly and with respect .
everyone has that right , to be respected .
but it must be a mutual respect .
the german government has also debated amending the country 's constitution to limit the right of assembly for organizations and parties it believes to be a threat , effectively refusing them the right to march and demonstrate .
would this be an infringement of people 's rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has debated banning npd marches i would have to return to the point i made about the banning of the npd .
if people spread hate and division , be it in printed materials , oratory or demonstrations then they are not using their freedom of speech or their right to assembly responsibly .
they are not conducting themselves with respect for others and their actions can be deemed offensive , although extremists are very careful about what is said and presented at demonstrations as not to break any direct laws regarding anti-semitism for example .
what more can be done to tackle the problem of racially motivated crime , not just in germany but in europe as a whole ?
politicians have a responsibility to draw attention to those seeking to exploit people 's fears .
the best of way of exposing these people as racists is to ridicule them , to show that they have no real answers to the problems that they complain about .
besides , these extremists blame everybody else for the own problems .
politicians can create a society through working at the grass roots level , with religious and community leaders , where the npd is seen as ridiculous , a party with no basis and with no issues .
we should work together to show that differences between people are there to be enjoyed ; they give our lives and our homes great color and diversity .
this is what should be championed .
and by doing so , the power of the racists is taken away .
there is no silver bullet when dealing with the problems of extremists and racially motivated violence .
banning the npd may be part of the solution , but we should n't get distracted by it as a solution on its own .
if the npd was banned then that would be one step , but as i said before , it would not be the end .
we must change the way people think through education and through the positive promotion of diversity .

the comment comes after a senior judge called for all uk residents and visitors to be required to provide a dna sample to help police solve crimes .
lord justice sedley said this would make the present database in england and wales fairer and less biased .
the database currently holds details of four million people 's dna .
each month , some 30,000 more samples from suspects or dna recovered from crime scenes are added to the database , making it the largest in the world .
' ripe for abuse ' it includes some 24,000 samples from young people aged between 10 and 17 , who were arrested but never convicted .
it also stores samples from nearly 40 % of the black men in england and wales compared with 9 % of the white men , according to home office and census figures .
but the idea of expanding it any further has come in for a barrage of criticism . "
everybody , guilty or innocent , should expect their dna to be on file for the absolutely rigorously restricted purpose of crime detection and prevention " sir stephen sedley dna database : a step too far ?
reaction to database call the human genetics commission said creating such a huge database would be too expensive and prone to mistakes being made .
civil rights group , liberty , meanwhile , attacked the proposal as " chilling " and " ripe for abuse " .
a spokesman for prime minister gordon brown said dna had helped tackle crime , but expanding the database would create " huge logistical and bureaucratic issues " and civil liberty concerns .
he said there were no plans for a voluntary national or compulsory uk database .
who 's on the database ? 5.2 % of uk population nearly 40 % of black men 13 % of asian men 9 % of white men source : home office and census should we all be on it ?
home office minister tony mcnulty said the database had helped police solve as many as 20,000 crimes a year .
in scotland , dna samples taken when people are arrested must be destroyed if the individual is not charged or convicted .
but lord justice sedley , who is one of england 's most experienced appeal court judges , insisted the present system was " indefensible " and it was time to move forwards .
he cited a catalogue of problems with the present system in england and wales . % population on database austria 1 % germany 0.41 % france 0.11 % spain 0.01 % us 0.5 % source : home office if you happen to have been in the hands of the police then your dna is on permanent record while many people who are walking the streets and whose dna would show them guilty of crimes , go free , he said .
he added that ethnic profiling meant disproportionate numbers of ethnic minorities were on the database .
" going forwards has very serious but manageable implications .
it means that everybody , guilty or innocent , should expect their dna to be on file for the absolutely rigorously restricted purpose of crime detection and prevention , " he said .
dna profiling deoxyribonucleic acid -lrb- dna -rrb- is found in virtually all cells only a tiny sample of saliva , blood , semen , etc , is needed for testing at the molecule 's core is a long sequence of chemical units , which is checked for a gender and 10 other ' markers ' probability of a chance match is less than one in one billion a match may be with a specific individual or hint at a relative profiles can provide indications of ethnic origin they do not point to genetic disorders or susceptibilities keith jarrett , president of the black police association , backed his call , saying the current system was " untenable " .
" you ca n't have a system where so many black youths who have done nothing wrong are perhaps going to the police station for elimination from a crime and find that their dna is on the database , " he said .

he was diagnosed last year with cancer of the pancreas .
health problems dogged pavarotti 's farewell tour pavarotti was born in modena , italy , on 12 october , 1935 , the first and only child of a baker .
as a boy , he was more interested in football than music and earned his first local fame as a member of the town 's soccer team .
he first sang in the town chorus with his father , an opera lover and gifted amateur tenor .
when the rossini male chorus won first prize in an international competition , pavarotti decided to pursue music full-time .
his professional debut came on 29 april , 1961 , in one of the great tenor roles , rodolfo in puccini 's la boheme , at the opera house in reggio emilia .
after italian success came engagements in amsterdam , vienna , zurich and london .
in 1965 , he made his us debut in a miami production of donizetti 's lucia di lammermoor with joan sutherland - the start of what would become a historic partnership .
audience frenzy it was in the united states in 1972 that pavarotti produced one of his legendary performances .
the singer found international stardom as one of the three tenors in la fille du regiment at new york 's metropolitan opera , he sang nine effortless high cs - causing the audience to erupt in a frenzied ovation .
his recordings became best sellers , covering a wide range of the opera repertoire as well as anthologies of neapolitan and other italian songs .
but pavarotti 's fame broadened dramatically when he took part in one of the most remarkable classical concerts of recent times during the 1990 world cup - as one of the three tenors .
with jose carreras and placido domingo , pavarotti was broadcast around the world singing a selection of famous arias and popular songs .
the broadcast was a major ratings hit and the subsequent record became one of the biggest-selling classical discs of all time .
huge concerts his 1992 concert in london 's hyde park , in the presence of charles and diana , the prince and princess of wales , was the first classical concert in the history of the park and drew some 150,000 people .
in june 1993 , more than 500,000 fans gathered to enjoy his performance in new york 's central park .
that september , he sang in the shadow of the eiffel tower in paris to a further 300,000 fans .
he gave his final opera performance in new york in 2004 while many in the classical world criticised the outdoor concerts as mere stunts , his defenders said he was doing a valuable job in popularising opera - and letting large numbers hear one of history 's great voices .
there were also grumbles about his duets with pop stars like sting , bono and bryan adams .
but pavarotti was also dedicated to the development of young singers , conducting standing-room-only master classes at conservatories around the world .
in march 2004 , he gave his final performance in an opera in puccini 's tosca in new york , where he received a 11-minute standing ovation .
later that year , he announced he would begin a 40-city farewell tour in 2005 before " taking his leave " .

but he warned that it would not work everywhere , and said the priority was to offer children good food in school .
some of the area 's schools have already begun the policy to discourage children from going out to buy takeaways .
the tv chef , who led a campaign for better school meals , said it would be interesting to see how it will work .
denbighshire council wants to reverse a slump in school meal take-up and is considering rolling out the idea across the county .
latest figures from denbighshire council show that fewer than half of primary school pupils eat school meals , compared with 55 % in 2004 - 2005 .
within secondary schools in the same period , numbers also fell by more than 50,000 to 573,000 .
' good choice ' a working group has drawn up draft guidance for head teachers to establish an all-school policy " encouraging schools to retain pupils on school sites over the lunch break . "
school governors , head teachers and teaching unions will now be asked for their views on the draft , according to a report to be discussed by councillors .
mr oliver , who pushed for schools to be allocated more money to provide healthier meals , said : " it will be interesting to see how denbighshire gets on with this idea .
" keeping children on school premises at lunchtimes is one possible solution , but it would n't work for every council or for every school .
" the important thing is to make sure kids are offered a good choice of good food in schools . "
probably fish and chips does still have the edge but if that option is withdrawn , or at least limited , students do quite quickly get used to ... and enjoy , the new healthy eating menus steve price , denbighshire council despite recent claims by politicians that the school meals service is in meltdown , many schools were making real progress in persuading children to accept healthier menus , he said .
he added : " it 's important that the food is tasty , that the dinner ladies are being supported , that the dining room is good and not too crowded and that the kids have enough time to get their food and eat it during their break . "
many children want hand-held food so they can " eat it and go , " he said , which is why taking food like nutritious burgers and wraps into the playground on his tv series had worked .
steve price , of denbighshire council , said the policy of banning from leaving in the lunch hour was already in place at some schools and had " worked quite successfully " .
mr oliver said this week that support for healthy meals must continue he said : " requiring pupils without authorisation from the parents or guardians to leave the site to stay on site that does happen but it does n't happen throughout the county and that 's what the policy really is looking at .
" to roll out the good practises and to assist governing bodies , the heads and the school staff to do that . "
more than 4,000 questionnaires had been given out to pupils as part of extensive market research done by the council .
this had been used to develop new menus going out this week to parents , he said .
feedback showed pupils were not against the healthy eating initiative , he said , adding : " we 've found that probably fish and chips does still have the edge but if that option is withdrawn , or at least limited , students do quite quickly get used to ... and enjoy , the new healthy eating menus . "
the new menus would feature the likes of chips and homemade pizza one day a week with options like roast dinner , filled rolls or baked fresh food on other days .
he said a policy that could be offered to all governing bodies could be ready by the end of the autumn term .
