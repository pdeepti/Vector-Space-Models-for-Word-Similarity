program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.12.2007 exhibition follows europe 's route out of the ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum brings visitors in touch with europe 's history most people think they know at least something about the history of europe and the eu .
but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .
13 , edition . despite the difficulties , police arrested three alleged terrorists on sept .
4 before attacks amounting to what chief federal prosecutor monika harms called the " biggest planned attacks in germany " could be carried out . experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . a distressing situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have accused the police of trying to grab more investigative authority the german interior ministry , which is responsible for both the police and intelligence departments , did not comment on the report on wednesday .
the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .
13 , edition . despite the difficulties , police arrested three alleged terrorists on sept .
4 before attacks amounting to what chief federal prosecutor monika harms called the " biggest planned attacks in germany " could be carried out . experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . a distressing situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have accused the police of trying to grab more investigative authority the german interior ministry , which is responsible for both the police and intelligence departments , did not comment on the report on wednesday .
the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.12.2007 leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders put pen to paper on the document which marks a new beginning after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact .

brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .

30 were the last straw : never before had so many reports by national broadcasters on political topics been paid for , according to independent observers . big business for campaign reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuchma subjected journalists to censorship unprecedented sums flowed from the parties ' secret coffers into those of the television broadcasters , said victoria siumar from the kiev institute for mass information : a two-minute pr report cost around $ 5,000 -lrb- about 7,400 euros -rrb- , while a broadcast with a live appearance from politicians went for $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 . a total of between $ 200 and $ 300 million was paid to broadcasters during the campaign , according to different estimates , siumar added . campaign leader wants to name names a major part of the " we ca n't be bought " campaign is monitoring broadcasters across the country in order to identify paid news reports .
the initial findings would be published soon and include specific examples of bribery , said campaign co-founder yegor sobolyev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a fickle path sobolyev emphasized that his group was n't out to condemn politicians who had paid for broadcasts , but , above all , to spare the journalism profession . " i insist that we do n't just talk about broadcasters and tendencies , but that the names of those involved - from the managers to the journalists - are given , " sobolyev said .
" the country has to know who is responsible . " the campaign leader is n't so worried about getting flack from colleagues ; he 's more concerned about bribery becoming common practice in the field . reliable news is better for broadcasters " paid news reports usually force lies onto the viewer , which some of them may believe , " but it 's even worse when those reports take the place of more important news , sobolyev said . another of the group 's concerns is that the younger generation of journalists who did n't experience censorship under kuchma is less aware of the danger that media bribes present to press freedom .
after all , the incentives could soon be replaced with harsh limitations , said sobolyev . " we see this tendency and want to beat this sickness before it kills us . " the campaign leader is convinced , however , that broadcasters will come to their senses , since bribes ca n't constitute a sustainable income .
to raise their ratings and maintain a stable income , broadcasters have to present reliable information and gain credibility with their viewers , he said . eugen theise -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .

the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 were the last straw : never before had so many reports by national broadcasters on political topics been paid for , according to independent observers . big business for campaign reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuchma subjected journalists to censorship unprecedented sums flowed from the parties ' secret coffers into those of the television broadcasters , said victoria siumar from the kiev institute for mass information : a two-minute pr report cost around $ 5,000 -lrb- about 7,400 euros -rrb- , while a broadcast with a live appearance from politicians went for $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 . a total of between $ 200 and $ 300 million was paid to broadcasters during the campaign , according to different estimates , siumar added . campaign leader wants to name names a major part of the " we ca n't be bought " campaign is monitoring broadcasters across the country in order to identify paid news reports .
the initial findings would be published soon and include specific examples of bribery , said campaign co-founder yegor sobolyev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a fickle path sobolyev emphasized that his group was n't out to condemn politicians who had paid for broadcasts , but , above all , to spare the journalism profession . " i insist that we do n't just talk about broadcasters and tendencies , but that the names of those involved - from the managers to the journalists - are given , " sobolyev said .
" the country has to know who is responsible . " the campaign leader is n't so worried about getting flack from colleagues ; he 's more concerned about bribery becoming common practice in the field . reliable news is better for broadcasters " paid news reports usually force lies onto the viewer , which some of them may believe , " but it 's even worse when those reports take the place of more important news , sobolyev said . another of the group 's concerns is that the younger generation of journalists who did n't experience censorship under kuchma is less aware of the danger that media bribes present to press freedom .
after all , the incentives could soon be replaced with harsh limitations , said sobolyev . " we see this tendency and want to beat this sickness before it kills us . " the campaign leader is convinced , however , that broadcasters will come to their senses , since bribes ca n't constitute a sustainable income .
to raise their ratings and maintain a stable income , broadcasters have to present reliable information and gain credibility with their viewers , he said . eugen theise -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .

bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .

the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .
13 , edition . despite the difficulties , police arrested three alleged terrorists on sept .
4 before attacks amounting to what chief federal prosecutor monika harms called the " biggest planned attacks in germany " could be carried out . experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . a distressing situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have accused the police of trying to grab more investigative authority the german interior ministry , which is responsible for both the police and intelligence departments , did not comment on the report on wednesday .
the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .

bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .

in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .
" remember , " he said , " it is our solidarity that unites us . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .

a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .

the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .

the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported .

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .

bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .

the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

30 were the last straw : never before had so many reports by national broadcasters on political topics been paid for , according to independent observers . big business for campaign reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuchma subjected journalists to censorship unprecedented sums flowed from the parties ' secret coffers into those of the television broadcasters , said victoria siumar from the kiev institute for mass information : a two-minute pr report cost around $ 5,000 -lrb- about 7,400 euros -rrb- , while a broadcast with a live appearance from politicians went for $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 . a total of between $ 200 and $ 300 million was paid to broadcasters during the campaign , according to different estimates , siumar added . campaign leader wants to name names a major part of the " we ca n't be bought " campaign is monitoring broadcasters across the country in order to identify paid news reports .
the initial findings would be published soon and include specific examples of bribery , said campaign co-founder yegor sobolyev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a fickle path sobolyev emphasized that his group was n't out to condemn politicians who had paid for broadcasts , but , above all , to spare the journalism profession . " i insist that we do n't just talk about broadcasters and tendencies , but that the names of those involved - from the managers to the journalists - are given , " sobolyev said .
" the country has to know who is responsible . " the campaign leader is n't so worried about getting flack from colleagues ; he 's more concerned about bribery becoming common practice in the field . reliable news is better for broadcasters " paid news reports usually force lies onto the viewer , which some of them may believe , " but it 's even worse when those reports take the place of more important news , sobolyev said . another of the group 's concerns is that the younger generation of journalists who did n't experience censorship under kuchma is less aware of the danger that media bribes present to press freedom .
after all , the incentives could soon be replaced with harsh limitations , said sobolyev . " we see this tendency and want to beat this sickness before it kills us . " the campaign leader is convinced , however , that broadcasters will come to their senses , since bribes ca n't constitute a sustainable income .
to raise their ratings and maintain a stable income , broadcasters have to present reliable information and gain credibility with their viewers , he said . eugen theise -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.12.2007 leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders put pen to paper on the document which marks a new beginning after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .

the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.12.2007 exhibition follows europe 's route out of the ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum brings visitors in touch with europe 's history most people think they know at least something about the history of europe and the eu .
but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.12.2007 leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders put pen to paper on the document which marks a new beginning after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .

public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .

the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .

he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .

palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported .

the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.12.2007 leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders put pen to paper on the document which marks a new beginning after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .

socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .

the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .

" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.12.2007 exhibition follows europe 's route out of the ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum brings visitors in touch with europe 's history most people think they know at least something about the history of europe and the eu .
but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .
but whether gore 's star power can move things along in bali is doubtful given the little time remaining for delegates to strike a deal .
with less than a day left before the conference ends , un climate chief yvo de boer said he was " very worried " about the slow pace of the negotiations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 were the last straw : never before had so many reports by national broadcasters on political topics been paid for , according to independent observers . big business for campaign reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuchma subjected journalists to censorship unprecedented sums flowed from the parties ' secret coffers into those of the television broadcasters , said victoria siumar from the kiev institute for mass information : a two-minute pr report cost around $ 5,000 -lrb- about 7,400 euros -rrb- , while a broadcast with a live appearance from politicians went for $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 . a total of between $ 200 and $ 300 million was paid to broadcasters during the campaign , according to different estimates , siumar added . campaign leader wants to name names a major part of the " we ca n't be bought " campaign is monitoring broadcasters across the country in order to identify paid news reports .
the initial findings would be published soon and include specific examples of bribery , said campaign co-founder yegor sobolyev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a fickle path sobolyev emphasized that his group was n't out to condemn politicians who had paid for broadcasts , but , above all , to spare the journalism profession . " i insist that we do n't just talk about broadcasters and tendencies , but that the names of those involved - from the managers to the journalists - are given , " sobolyev said .
" the country has to know who is responsible . " the campaign leader is n't so worried about getting flack from colleagues ; he 's more concerned about bribery becoming common practice in the field . reliable news is better for broadcasters " paid news reports usually force lies onto the viewer , which some of them may believe , " but it 's even worse when those reports take the place of more important news , sobolyev said . another of the group 's concerns is that the younger generation of journalists who did n't experience censorship under kuchma is less aware of the danger that media bribes present to press freedom .
after all , the incentives could soon be replaced with harsh limitations , said sobolyev . " we see this tendency and want to beat this sickness before it kills us . " the campaign leader is convinced , however , that broadcasters will come to their senses , since bribes ca n't constitute a sustainable income .
to raise their ratings and maintain a stable income , broadcasters have to present reliable information and gain credibility with their viewers , he said . eugen theise -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.12.2007 exhibition follows europe 's route out of the ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum brings visitors in touch with europe 's history most people think they know at least something about the history of europe and the eu .
but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spies said the police were greedy for power . police investigators said they suffered from incomplete information provided by intelligence agencies and swaths of germany were left unprotected from other serious crimes while authorities pursued three terror suspects , according to an article in the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- . intelligence officers needed six weeks to analyze recorded conversations and police investigators had to rely on their personal mobile phones to discuss the case because secure telephone connections were often not available outside of business hours , the paper reported . the report was also critical of internal personnel decisions that sent officers assigned to the case back to other departments , which led to a lack of continuity in the investigation , the paper quoted from the police report . no extra officers available bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few officers would have been available for a hostage situation or other emergency for four months the three german states of baden-württemberg , hesse and saarland did not have any mobile deployment teams on hand to send to an emergency situation , the sz reported . " during the investigation , it became clear that there are serious shortcomings in terms of the police 's personnel and equipment , " konrad freiberg , head of the police union , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung for its thursday , dec .
13 , edition . despite the difficulties , police arrested three alleged terrorists on sept .
4 before attacks amounting to what chief federal prosecutor monika harms called the " biggest planned attacks in germany " could be carried out . experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . a distressing situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have accused the police of trying to grab more investigative authority the german interior ministry , which is responsible for both the police and intelligence departments , did not comment on the report on wednesday .
the country 's 16 state interior ministers , however , are scheduled to discuss the police report , which was written in november . wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , called on the interior ministers to address the problems mentioned in the report . " it is distressing to see the serious problems that had to be fought against , " he told thursday 's kölner stadt-anzeiger daily . security 's one-way street the police report 's conclusion called for police to be outfitted with their own means of procuring intelligence information , according to an article in the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine . such a conclusion can only serve as propaganda for state and federal police forces looking to gain additional investigative powers , two anonymous intelligence officers told the magazine . " it all goes relentlessly in one direction : the police want their own intelligence service , " one of the officers told spiegel online , adding that the police had acquired all the information they needed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.12.2007 leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders put pen to paper on the document which marks a new beginning after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .
new installations and artwork present modern interpretations of the european story , while audio and visual displays add to the experience , transporting the visitor to recreated moments in time .
" a lot of museums around europe have actual , solid evidence of its history , " barnavi said .
" we have this too , but visitors are treated to sensory experiences also .
" for example , instead of pieces of the berlin wall , we have a darkened room where the cries for freedom , broadcast news reports and even the chipping of masonry can be heard .
we want visitors to be transported to that time .
even if the language can not be understood , the emotions and sounds are universal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.12.2007 exhibition follows europe 's route out of the ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum brings visitors in touch with europe 's history most people think they know at least something about the history of europe and the eu .
but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .
they became a group .
and they have some amazing stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and english chunnel engineers feature as video guides " we have a polish man who was involved in the signing of the gdansk agreement , which eventually freed poland from communist rule , a romanian guy who went from being an ice-hockey star to a european commissioner , and the french and english engineers who first shook hands through the meeting point in the channel tunnel . "
each individual has contributed a memento of their time and homeland to the exhibition .
sounds and feelings from the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from starvation to an affluent society , europe 's story goes on while the exhibits themselves provide touchstones for europe 's defining events , the exhibition itself is more than just a show of collected pieces from the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.12.2007 carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting to bali by plane was n't the most earth-friendly option most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .
but a few took the long road to bali to make a statement about treading lightly on the earth . with 11,000 participants from all over the world , the conference is the biggest yet .
and while all the delegates have come to bali to talk about preventing global warming , the united nations estimates that they will also emit 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases along the way .
how heavy their personal carbon footprint is , though , depends a lot on how they got to bali : by plane , train or automobile . i started my trip to bali as environmentally-friendly as possible with a train trip from bonn to frankfurt - on an intercity express , one of the newest and most efficient of its kind .
but this short trip could n't make up for what came next - a flight to singapore on a boeing 747 jumbo jet .
from there , i took a slightly smaller plane to denpasar airport on bali . my share of the carbon emissions from the 24,500-kilometer -lrb- 15,200- mile -rrb- trip was at least 5,500 tons .
the various carbon calculators available on the internet each give a slightly different verdict .
still , no matter how you look at it , the carbon footprint i made ca n't be overlooked . sparse signs of environmental awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's intercity express train is efficient , but not emissions-free the streets of bali are jammed with cars and mopeds .
public transport is spotty at best .
like most of the participants at the conference , i took a taxi to my hotel .
indonesia does not place an environment tax on petrol - in fact , oil is subsidized .
my taxi driver said gas had gotten more expensive . " right now we buy the petrol for one liter 4,500 rupiah , " he said .
that 's about 50 cents -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- , which means that petrol in bali is about two-thirds cheaper than in germany . but there are signs on the island that the indonesians want to help stop global warming .
energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the garden lanterns at my hotel .
i can let cleaning staff know my sheets can be left unchanged with a sign on my door , but i 've only seen a few of them on my hall . outside , united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the conference hosts , have provided free bikes to ride to the conference .
but it is nearly 36 degrees celsius -lrb- 97 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , humid , and i see few of the 200 available bikes on the way to the conference center in nusa dua . it 's supposed to be bali 's rainy season , but there 's been little or no rain for the past month .
still , parts of the shores are completely under water as sea levels are rising . two-month train trip to bali the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said installing low-emissions light bulbs and energy-saving electrical devices , using better housing insulation and cutting transportation emissions as three main ways to prevent global warming . but airline travel alone accounts for two percent of global emissions .
the industry is not part of any emissions trading scheme , but delegates in bali have been discussing whether this might change in a future climate agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is evident in bali as well in a book about how people can reduce their carbon footprint , german journalist nick reimer calls airlines a " climate killer " because they produce three times more co2 per person and kilometer than a train . riemer spent two months in trains getting from berlin to bali .
along the way , he witnessed the effect climate change is having on the planet .
" for me it was interesting to see that climate change is a reality , " he said .
" i was at the aral sea in russia .
the water level has dropped by 40 meters .
we went to the mountains , and they did n't have enough rain .
the glaciers are melting . " in the end , after traveling through russia , china , and central asia , a flood and typhoon in vietnam forced reimer to fly to bali .
he does n't have exact figures on the carbon emissions from his train trip , but at least his conscience is n't as burdened as mine . earth-friendly cars do n't have to be pricey swiss entrepreneur louis palmer is another man who is walking - or , actually , driving - the talk .
he drove his prototype solar taxi , a small blue and white three-wheel car pulling a trailer of solar panels behind him , all the way from switzerland .
the 13,500-kilometer trip , sponsored by the german solar producer q-cells , took over five months . " i wanted to show that the technology is there , if we are only willing to use it , " palmer said .
" if this car was mass-produced , it would only cost 6,000 euros .
that is cheaper than any car here in indonesia at the moment . " the solar taxi gets half of its energy directly from the solar panels , the other half from a battery .
palmer has an arrangement with the swiss electrical company to take solar-powered energy off the grid .
it is a huge attraction at the bali conference , and people are lining up to take rides . " wherever we went , whether in turkey or saudi arabia , people came out and gave us thumbs up .
everyone loves this car , " said palmer . certificates can offset carbon emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis palmer traveled for five months to bali in his solar taxi besides a few boat trips , his carbon footprint for the trip to bali is practically zero .
he said he is even offsetting the boat trips by buying certificates that will support green technologies in developing countries like indonesia . robert turner from world future council , an ngo , says this is an option even the airplane passengers can take . " our airline has a carbon offsetting system , " turner said .
" they will invest in planting new trees or in green technology projects .
but it is costly .
we paid 900 euros more for each airline ticket to come to bali . " the cost of carbon , in monetary terms , is maybe the only way to really feel the impact .
the un says it will invest in so-called clean development mechanisms - green technology in developing nations like indonesia - to offset the conference . they are taking the pressure off me , in a way , so that i can walk with a light carbon footprint , even after bali . kateri jochum , bali send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states , along with canada , japan and russia , has so far opposed efforts to reach a consensus on how to combat climate change post-2012 by refusing to accept a target range for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : world wildlife fund activists want delegates to agree on targets to cut emissions gabriel said that unless negotiations in bali ended with a new landmark agreement , european nations would boycott us-led climate talks scheduled to take place in honolulu next month .
" no result in bali means no major economies meeting , " said gabriel .
the us has invited 16 other " major economies " including the eu , japan , china and india , to discuss a program of nationally determined , voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , as opposed to the binding targets favored by the eu and others now meeting in bali .
reduction targets essential , gabriel says delegates in bali have been discussing calling for emissions cuts in the range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
gabriel has described this target range as the " core " of the current negotiations .
he said that from the eu perspective , any result from bali that does not refer to scientific evidence for the need to cut emissions as outlined in a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change would be insufficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many climate change activists hope al gore can save the day in bali although he criticized canada , japan and russia for contributing to the current deadlock in bali , gabriel accused the us of posing the main obstacle to progress .
" they do n't want to be seen as the blockade country , but they 're not doing anything in order to come to a concrete result , " the environment minister said .
in a telephone call with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday , dec .
13 , gabriel reportedly discussed the possibility of merkel speaking directly with some of heads of state about the bali conference , hinting that one of these would be us president george w. bush .
bush and merkel are known to enjoy a close working relationship .
gore to push for breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a top eu official , gabriel threatened to boycott us-led climate talks next month another hope for a breakthrough in the stalled climate talks has emerged in the form of al gore , who arrived in bali on thursday , just days after he received the nobel peace prize for his tireless crusade against global warming .
the former us vice president is scheduled to address a side event and meet key players in the climate debate .

but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard . even as the leaders of the european union gathered to sign a landmark treaty designed to improve the way the 27-nation bloc functions , there were signs that the skepticism and self-interest , which has dogged the 50-year-old organization , would still be a feature of its future .
all of the eu 's 27 prime ministers or heads of state and their foreign ministers were in attendance to the sign the 250-page lisbon treaty in the portuguese capital on thursday - bar one .
british prime minister gordon brown was absent from the latest show of togetherness , citing " long-standing diary commitments " in london .
foreign secretary david miliband signed the treaty for britain at the ceremony .
while he was expected to sign the treaty later in the day , brown 's failure to sign alongside his eu allies renewed the charges of euro-skepticism which have followed him for most of his recent career . brown 's mixed signals over europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been under pressure at home over the eu the treaty is seen as being wildly unpopular in the uk with many believing it cedes too much power to the feared " eu superstate " and critics of the prime minister have already called his delayed signing a " cowardly attempt to distance himself from the eu pact . "
" there is no better manifestation of his lack of interest in europe than his thinking that missing the signature would not be a big deal , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform , a london-based think tank , in an interview with afp .
" it 's a piece of very ham-fisted diplomacy on the part of brown . "
brown came under heavy domestic fire earlier this year when he resisted pressure for a referendum on the new treaty despite it being part of the labour party 's 2005 manifesto , justifying his willingness to be involved by stating that britain had negotiated opt-outs in key policy areas , meaning its sovereignty remained protected .
his apparent support for the lisbon treaty also caused consternation due to his previous vehement resistance to influence from brussels while finance minister under tony blair when he reportedly vetoed blair 's plans to take britain into the european single currency .
prime minister 's absence hints at future challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu showed solidarity in lisbon but how long will it last ?
even before thursday 's awkward handling of the lisbon treaty signing , commentators had already noted that brown has not yet traveled to brussels , nearly six months after taking office .
the treaty , which seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage , is seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
the signing ceremony , with its grand setting of lisbon 's magnificent jeronimos monastery and the background music of dulce pontes , one of portugal 's most renowned singers , was also supposed to be a celebration of togetherness .
brown 's absence reminded everybody that signing the treaty was just the start .
it would be the implementation of the ideals within that would define its success .
the lisbon treaty is the first major overhaul of eu rules since the treaty of nice was agreed on , almost exactly seven years ago .
under the new treaty , the bloc will create the role of a new eu president , appointed for up to five years , which will replace the current rotation system where member states take turns to hold the eu presidency for six months .
a treaty to empower europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the treaty will help the eu deliver on its promises it also updates the eu 's executive body , the commission , which draws up eu-level laws and makes sure that they are implemented .
at present , every single eu member state nominates a commissioner , but the treaty reduces that number to 18 .
" the treaty of lisbon will reinforce the union 's capacity to act and the ability to achieve those goals in an effective way , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a speech at the start of the ceremony .
" as such , it will help the union to deliver better results to european citizens .
" it is the treaty of an enlarged europe from the mediterranean to the baltic , from the atlantic ocean to the black sea .
a europe that shares common values and common ambitions , " barroso said .
" for the first time , the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated , " barroso said , in reference to the former soviet states which have joined during the bloc 's expansion .
an historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was praised for her work on the treaty " history will remember this day as a day when new paths of hope were opened to the european ideal , " said portuguese premier jose socrates , whose country currently holds the eu presidency and has played a fundamental role - along with the german eu presidency in the first half of 2007 - in getting eu leaders to agree on the text during the course of the year .
socrates was among many leaders who offered their thanks to german chancellor angela merkel , who steered the negotiations which led to the agreed text .
in his speech to the assembled leaders , germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the treaty would ensure that " europe becomes more transparent , europe becomes more democratic , and europe becomes more efficient . "
the german president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , added that the treaty was hugely significant as it showed a bloc willing to work together .

but the first exhibition of the europe museum in brussels shows that what 's common knowledge often barely scratches the surface . the journey from the ruins of war-torn europe to the modern amalgamation of states now known as the european union is one most often explained in political terms .
each step away from the smoldering ashes is usually known by a treaty 's name or the place where an important summit was held .
when people feature in the story of europe , it is our former leaders who are named ; the eu 's founding fathers jean monnet , robert schuman and paul-henri spaak , among others .
what is often overlooked in the tale of this phoenix-like continent is the slower recovery of the europeans themselves : the day-to-day process of surviving in postwar countries and the effects that the defining moments in our history had on individuals .
this is the story told by the " it 's our history " exhibition at the tour & taxis expo complex in brussels .
a permanent place of european memory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young auschwitz victim 's dress , one made from nazi banners and one from allied flags the exhibition , which runs until march 23 , is the first major show by the europe museum of brussels and will form the basis of a permanent exhibit once the museum finds a home of its own .
" this exhibition shows that we as europeans have a common history , " said elie barnavi , the museum 's scientific director .
" it is important to have such a display .
we will keep many of the artifacts and will buy others to form the permanent collection .
we will elaborate on the central theme , with temporary exhibitions focusing on different aspects of the european story as we expand . "
ten years ago , the idea of the europe museum was still only a collective thought in the minds of a group of scientists , historians and cultural promoters who were dedicated to creating a " place of memory " for europe .
" we now have what we like to think of as an infrastructural home for the history of the union , where we can show europe as a diverse but unique civilization , " said barnavi , a former israeli ambassador to france and professor of modern history .
the current exhibition takes visitors along the path of reconstruction and healing by following the road signs of agreements and contracts but poignantly emphasizes the human aspect through a breath-taking collection of artifacts donated from 80 museums across the continent .
poignant reminders of europe 's struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revolutions marked europe 's emergence from the cold war the struggle for a return to normality after world war ii is poignantly represented by a young girl 's dress , sewn together from the flags of the allied forces .
the fight for freedom that continued long after the war ended can be seen in the illustrated diary of a young hungarian during the 1956 anti-communist uprising in budapest and in the reconstructed razor-wire fencing of an iron curtain border barricade .
guiding visitors through the exhibition , 27 individuals - one from every member state of the european union - speak about their experiences through video footage at points relevant to their own story and involvement in the wider tale of europe .
" we found these people through international contacts and embassies , " barnavi said .
" it was hard work , but when they came together here , they created such great energy ...
to bring people with such experiences of hardship , loss and hope to one place , it was very moving how they shared their feelings despite the language barriers .

belief in the occult is widespread in many former soviet societies .

michael anderson , 44 , from newtown , set up his company with support from dyfed-powys probation service .
he spent time while serving a sentence for attempted armed robbery in the 1980s by making tobacco boxes .
mp lembit opik has already bought one of the matchstick boxes for his cheeky girl girlfriend , gabriela irimia .
he was inspired to turn his hobby into a full-time occupation after attending a rehabilitation course in gwynedd .
" it gives me immense pleasure , i lose myself from all the troubles , " said father-of-six mr anderson .
the intricate items fashioned from matches include small tobacco boxes and romany caravans , and he is currently working on a metre high grandfather clock .
it is extremely rewarding to see him come on like this and want to start his own business is amazing probation service officer tracy sandford mr anderson has been under the supervision of the probation service since march .
" i learnt how to match whilst i was incarcerated during a long prison term when i spent two and a half years inside at hmp highpoint , in suffolk , " said mr anderson .
" i was taught by one of the oldest cons i have seen in prison , he was about 70 .
he was an old forger and he took me under his wing and i found i had a talent for it . "
mr anderson explained what it took to make a matchstick model .
" you have to look at every single match and see which way it is going to be placed , " he added .
basic educational skills " i have to discard one-third of a bag in the bin because they are just not suitable .
" to make a tobacco tin you need 240 matches , with a romany caravan you 're looking at around 6,000 matches . "
he said he became so " engrossed " in his work that he forgot all his " hassles " .
probation service officer tracy sandford said mr anderson had made excellent progress .
" it is extremely rewarding to see him come on like this and want to start his own business is amazing , " she said .
" quite often the lack of basic educational skills is a major barrier for people and it can lead to them getting into a life of crime . "
among mr anderson 's first customers was montgomeryshire mp lembit opik who met him at an awards ceremony in newtown , and decided one of his models would make an excellent gift for his singer girlfriend .

however , the bank said that it was on track to meet analysts ' forecasts for its annual earnings .
hbos added it expected a " good full year outcome " despite difficulties in global markets and liquidity problems .
but hbos said it expected conditions would remain tough and that it would remain " prudent " in its lending policy .
hbos said underlying earnings per share should be 106p , up from 100.5p in 2006 , meeting analysts ' expectations .
the bank said its share of the uk mortgage market would be in the region of 17-18 % in the second half of 2007 , recovering from a share of only 8 % in the first half .
hbos said that the £ 180m write-down related to asset-backed securities and not exposure to us sub-prime borrowers , where it saw no credit impairments .
the bank said its total exposure to us sub-prime investments remained less than 0.1 % of its balance sheet .
it added that this exposure fell to £ 430m by the end of november from £ 550m at the end of august .
industry trend this latest statement is in contrast to other banks that have been hard hit by their exposure to the us sub-prime mortgage market .
the sub-prime market specialises in providing loans for those with risky or non-existent credit records .
once us interest rates increased , many borrowers who had bought during the boom found they could not afford the mortgage repayments .
earlier this week , swiss investment bank ubs announced a $ 10bn write-off in debts related to the sub-prime sector .
last month , barclays announced a £ 800m loss for october , putting losses at barclays capital investment bank at £ 1.3bn.
meanwhile , lloyds tsb expects the credit crisis to lead to losses of £ 200m for the current financial year .

his hold on power was weakened early in november when nine ministers and three backbenchers defected from government .
there have been no reports of unrest , but large numbers of police are patrolling the capital , honiara .
according to reuters news agency , mr sogavare told parliament : " the office does not belong to my father or my family , and i have no reason to remain in this office if i believe the allegations levelled against me are true " .
mr sogavare was appointed in may 2006 after the election of the original choice , snyder rini , sparked rioting .
chinese homes and business were attacked after mr rini was accused of using money from chinese and taiwanese backers to bribe mps into voting for him .
international criticism the opposition had previously called for mr sogavare to resign to " protect the integrity of parliament " .
but he refused and in thursday 's no-confidence motion , put forward by opposition leader fred fono , he was defeated by 25 votes to 23 .
he has faced domestic criticism in recent months for his abrasive style and for allegedly damaging the international image of the solomon islands .
he has a strained relationship with australia , which has had a peacekeeping mission in the solomon islands since 2003 , when it was invited there by the government to restore order .
particularly damaging was his controversial appointment of julian moti as attorney-general .
the opposition said the appointment was irresponsible , because mr moti was wanted in australia over child sex charges .

its latest survey shows that price falls became more widespread , with 58 % of its members reporting a drop in prices over the previous three months .
just 2 % of members said that prices were still rising .
prices fell in england , wales and northern ireland , and rose only in scotland , said rics .
the rics report backs up the evidence of other surveys which have all shown a recent downturn in the market .
" it is clear that the housing market continues to feel the strain of depressed market conditions , " said a rics spokesman , jeremy leaf .
" the recent credit crunch continues to hit confidence in the market .
however , while underlying economic fundamentals remain sound and the labour market remains strong , large falls in prices remain unlikely , " he added .
slowdown house price inflation and new mortgage approvals have slowed considerably under the impact of past increases in interest rates , combined with the impact of the northern rock crisis . "
buyers have got no confidence , sellers have got no confidence " trevor kent , estate agent rics said that inquiries from new buyers were still falling heavily , while the number of newly-agreed sales was dropping at its fastest rate since 1999 , when rics first started questioning its members about them .
surveyors also think that banks and building societies are becoming more fussy about the customers they are prepared to lend to , knocking activity in the market further .
as a result , they are at their gloomiest about the state of the market since 1998 .
" sales generally are looking very sick indeed , " said trevor kent , an estate agent from gerrards cross .
" one expects this to be the case before christmas , but this is unprecedented .
" it does n't look as if it is going to be very promising for the next few months - buyers have got no confidence , sellers have got no confidence , " he said .
rate cut last week the bank of england cut interest rates , for the first time since 2005 , by 0.25 % .
the uk 's three biggest mortgage lenders have passed this on in full to their borrowers .
but with more than a million homeowners moving off cheap fixed-rate mortgages in the coming year , this is unlikely to make a difference on its own to the expense of borrowing a mortgage .
this week , the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- reported that mortgage interest costs were swallowing up more of the incomes of mortgage holders than at any time since the early 1990s .

your answer may tell you which side of the debate you are on when it comes to china and climate change .
mighty china is the trainee superpower whose economy is growing at 10 % a year , and has a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
it has nuclear weapons , has just sent a rocket into lunar orbit , has one-trillion us dollars in reserves and is the world 's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
humble china is the poor developing nation which has tens of millions of people in poverty .
its barefoot farmers still cart oxen across fields , its gdp per capita is $ 2,000 -lrb- putting it between the democratic republic of congo and samoa -rrb- and its per capita greenhouse gas emissions are one-fifth of those in the usa .
bridging the divide the west tends to picture mighty china .
it believes this kind of china can afford to get serious about reducing - or even capping - its greenhouse emissions .
after all , if china can fire a rocket to take pictures of the moon , it can also find the money to clean up its old-fashioned coal-fired power stations .
but china sees itself as humble china - a country which does not have to cap its emissions since its people are responsible for far fewer greenhouse gases per head than westerners .
humble china argues passionately that chinese people have the moral right to live like everyone in the west - since all men are born equal .
humble china also believes that the west is to blame for climate change - since western industrial revolutions made the world a hotter place .
since the west is to blame , humble china argues that the west should pay for the clean-up .
the ruling communist party -lrb- the leading humble china adherent -rrb- believes that the west has to take the lead in helping developing countries with financial aid and technology transfer .
but it also insists that china is taking action on its own - the country 's climate change plan announced in june set a target of improving energy efficiency by 20 % by 2010 .
it has also promised to raise the amount of renewable energy it uses , and to make " significant achievements " in controlling greenhouse gas emissions .
but it will not set a target or a cap .
negotiators in bali have to find a way of bridging the divide between mighty china and humble china .
here is a point they will have to consider : china insists its people have the absolute right to live as westerners do .
but if the country exercises this right without changing the way it develops , global warming will get much worse .

i thought relations between britain and russia could not get any worse .
i was wrong .
russia has decided to raise the stakes again , and the victim is the poor old british council .
you may have never heard of the british council .
even if you have , you may have no idea what it does .
plenty of people do not .
even the british ambassador to moscow seemed a bit confused as to whether the russians were ordering the closure of the british council or the british consul .
political point what it does elsewhere , i am not sure , but in russia , the british council used to teach a lot of people english , and it offers rather fewer scholarships to study in britain .
closing down its offices outside moscow sounds rather self-defeating , but then the russian government has repeatedly shown itself willing to do things that hurt russia in order to make a political point . "
should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ?
no !
we are not a colony of great britain " russian mp and the closing of the british council is very much political .
no lesser figure than the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told me so himself .
the closure order was , he said , " retaliation " for the british government 's decision to expel russian diplomats from the uk in july .
that does not make sense .
in july , britain expelled four russian diplomats in response -lrb- call it retaliation if you like -rrb- to russia 's refusal to extradite a man named andrei lugovoi to stand trial in the uk .
britain accuses him of taking part in the murder of a russian exile , alexander litvinenko , in london in 2006 .
but after britain expelled the four russians , moscow wasted no time in retaliating .
it immediately expelled four british diplomats .
it was tit-for-tat .
everybody thought that was it .
yes , relations between britain and russia would remain frosty for a while , but both sides had made their point .
neither wanted a full blown diplomatic war .
or so we all thought .
deliberate slight now moscow says it is ordering the closure of all but one of the british council offices in russia .
why ?
and why now ?
the answer seems to be that the diplomatic war is not over .
and at the moment , neither britain nor russia seems at all interested in making the first move to bring it to an end .
has britain done anything that could have provoked russia ?
yes , lots of things .
mr lavrov confirmed to me that gordon brown has still not bothered to pick up the phone to call vladimir putin since taking over as british prime minister .
it is a deliberate slight , and russia is a proud country that does not take kindly to such treatment .
britain 's ambassador to moscow , sir anthony brenton , has also given russia reason to feel aggrieved .
first , he has continued to repeat loudly and publicly britain 's demand that russia extradite mr lugovoi , despite the fact that russia has made it extremely clear it can not and will not do so .
" should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ? " one russian member of parliament barked at me last week .
" no !
we are not a colony of great britain . "
no lectures , please and this , for the russians , is the crux of it .
russia is a very big country , with an equally large inferiority complex .
it was clear from speaking to foreign minister lavrov that russia still perceived the world as being out to get it .
it still feels deeply humiliated by the collapse of the soviet union , and even more so by the chaos of the 1990s when it was forced to beg from the west .
russia is still a weak country , with a shambolic economy , decrepit infrastructure and a military where young conscripts are regularly beaten to death by their officers .
but now it has the steroid of oil revenues running through its veins , and that is making russia feel strong again .
it will no longer be lectured to by the west , and certainly not by the likes of foreign secretary david miliband or his representative in moscow .

your answer may tell you which side of the debate you are on when it comes to china and climate change .
mighty china is the trainee superpower whose economy is growing at 10 % a year , and has a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
it has nuclear weapons , has just sent a rocket into lunar orbit , has one-trillion us dollars in reserves and is the world 's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
humble china is the poor developing nation which has tens of millions of people in poverty .
its barefoot farmers still cart oxen across fields , its gdp per capita is $ 2,000 -lrb- putting it between the democratic republic of congo and samoa -rrb- and its per capita greenhouse gas emissions are one-fifth of those in the usa .
bridging the divide the west tends to picture mighty china .
it believes this kind of china can afford to get serious about reducing - or even capping - its greenhouse emissions .
after all , if china can fire a rocket to take pictures of the moon , it can also find the money to clean up its old-fashioned coal-fired power stations .
but china sees itself as humble china - a country which does not have to cap its emissions since its people are responsible for far fewer greenhouse gases per head than westerners .
humble china argues passionately that chinese people have the moral right to live like everyone in the west - since all men are born equal .
humble china also believes that the west is to blame for climate change - since western industrial revolutions made the world a hotter place .
since the west is to blame , humble china argues that the west should pay for the clean-up .

i thought relations between britain and russia could not get any worse .
i was wrong .
russia has decided to raise the stakes again , and the victim is the poor old british council .
you may have never heard of the british council .
even if you have , you may have no idea what it does .
plenty of people do not .
even the british ambassador to moscow seemed a bit confused as to whether the russians were ordering the closure of the british council or the british consul .
political point what it does elsewhere , i am not sure , but in russia , the british council used to teach a lot of people english , and it offers rather fewer scholarships to study in britain .
closing down its offices outside moscow sounds rather self-defeating , but then the russian government has repeatedly shown itself willing to do things that hurt russia in order to make a political point .
should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ?
no !
we are not a colony of great britain russian mp and the closing of the british council is very much political .
no lesser figure than the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told me so himself .
the closure order was , he said , " retaliation " for the british government 's decision to expel russian diplomats from the uk in july .
that does not make sense .
in july , britain expelled four russian diplomats in response -lrb- call it retaliation if you like -rrb- to russia 's refusal to extradite a man named andrei lugovoi to stand trial in the uk .
britain accuses him of taking part in the murder of a russian exile , alexander litvinenko , in london in 2006 .
but after britain expelled the four russians , moscow wasted no time in retaliating .
it immediately expelled four british diplomats .
it was tit-for-tat .
everybody thought that was it .
yes , relations between britain and russia would remain frosty for a while , but both sides had made their point .
neither wanted a full blown diplomatic war .
or so we all thought .
deliberate slight now moscow says it is ordering the closure of all but one of the british council offices in russia .
why ?
and why now ?
the answer seems to be that the diplomatic war is not over .
and at the moment , neither britain nor russia seems at all interested in making the first move to bring it to an end .
the uk 's repeated calls for mr lugovoi 's extradition still rankle has britain done anything that could have provoked russia ?
yes , lots of things .
mr lavrov confirmed to me that gordon brown has still not bothered to pick up the phone to call vladimir putin since taking over as british prime minister .
it is a deliberate slight , and russia is a proud country that does not take kindly to such treatment .
britain 's ambassador to moscow , sir anthony brenton , has also given russia reason to feel aggrieved .
first , he has continued to repeat loudly and publicly britain 's demand that russia extradite mr lugovoi , despite the fact that russia has made it extremely clear it can not and will not do so .
" should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ? " one russian member of parliament barked at me last week .
" no !
we are not a colony of great britain . "
no lectures , please and this , for the russians , is the crux of it .
russia is a very big country , with an equally large inferiority complex .
it was clear from speaking to foreign minister lavrov that russia still perceived the world as being out to get it .
it still feels deeply humiliated by the collapse of the soviet union , and even more so by the chaos of the 1990s when it was forced to beg from the west .
russia is still a weak country , with a shambolic economy , decrepit infrastructure and a military where young conscripts are regularly beaten to death by their officers .
but now it has the steroid of oil revenues running through its veins , and that is making russia feel strong again .
it will no longer be lectured to by the west , and certainly not by the likes of foreign secretary david miliband or his representative in moscow .

in july , britain expelled four russian diplomats in response -lrb- call it retaliation if you like -rrb- to russia 's refusal to extradite a man named andrei lugovoi to stand trial in the uk .
britain accuses him of taking part in the murder of a russian exile , alexander litvinenko , in london in 2006 .
but after britain expelled the four russians , moscow wasted no time in retaliating .
it immediately expelled four british diplomats .
it was tit-for-tat .
everybody thought that was it .
yes , relations between britain and russia would remain frosty for a while , but both sides had made their point .
neither wanted a full blown diplomatic war .
or so we all thought .
deliberate slight now moscow says it is ordering the closure of all but one of the british council offices in russia .
why ?
and why now ?
the answer seems to be that the diplomatic war is not over .
and at the moment , neither britain nor russia seems at all interested in making the first move to bring it to an end .
the uk 's repeated calls for mr lugovoi 's extradition still rankle has britain done anything that could have provoked russia ?
yes , lots of things .
mr lavrov confirmed to me that gordon brown has still not bothered to pick up the phone to call vladimir putin since taking over as british prime minister .
it is a deliberate slight , and russia is a proud country that does not take kindly to such treatment .
britain 's ambassador to moscow , sir anthony brenton , has also given russia reason to feel aggrieved .
first , he has continued to repeat loudly and publicly britain 's demand that russia extradite mr lugovoi , despite the fact that russia has made it extremely clear it can not and will not do so .
" should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ? " one russian member of parliament barked at me last week .
" no !
we are not a colony of great britain . "
no lectures , please and this , for the russians , is the crux of it .
russia is a very big country , with an equally large inferiority complex .
it was clear from speaking to foreign minister lavrov that russia still perceived the world as being out to get it .
it still feels deeply humiliated by the collapse of the soviet union , and even more so by the chaos of the 1990s when it was forced to beg from the west .
russia is still a weak country , with a shambolic economy , decrepit infrastructure and a military where young conscripts are regularly beaten to death by their officers .
but now it has the steroid of oil revenues running through its veins , and that is making russia feel strong again .
it will no longer be lectured to by the west , and certainly not by the likes of foreign secretary david miliband or his representative in moscow .

plenty of people do not .

political point what it does elsewhere , i am not sure , but in russia , the british council used to teach a lot of people english , and it offers rather fewer scholarships to study in britain .
closing down its offices outside moscow sounds rather self-defeating , but then the russian government has repeatedly shown itself willing to do things that hurt russia in order to make a political point .
should we change our constitution because we are ordered to by the british foreign secretary ?
no !
we are not a colony of great britain russian mp and the closing of the british council is very much political .

sing-a-long-a-dissolve-a-the-union !
you 've also pointed out that the second verse is likewise usually skipped - but some of you think it could become the anthem for the daily politics itself !
