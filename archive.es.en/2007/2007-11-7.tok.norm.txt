the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other baltic sea nations have said the pipeline poses a major risk to the environment . " this initiative , this project , has not been prepared well , " tusk , who is due to be nominated polish prime minister this week , said at a news conference . " i hope and i hear some signals that in the nearest future the sponsors of the project would be ready to seriously correct it , " he added , with providing details . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and the baltic states worry about future supplies .
the undersea pipeline will eventually run 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- from the northwestern russian port of vyborg to the northern german port of greifswald , bypassing current routes through poland , belarus and ukraine . the pipeline has been a source of friction between poland and germany in recent years .
poland has insisted on alternative routes for the link .
one option , called amber , would have the natural gas run through the three baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - and poland before reaching germany . russia is said to be less amenable to this idea , given that its relations with the baltic states and poland are frosty . the pipeline is being built by the russian-led nord stream consortium , which includes russia 's gazprom and german companies basf and e.on. gazprom currently holds 51 percent of the project while e.on and basf each hold a 20-percent stake . dutch participation on tuesday , nov .
6 , russian and dutch officials signed an agreement reported worth 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.24 billion -rrb- to bring the dutch gas giant nederlandse gasunie nv into the project .
the dutch company will have a 9 percent stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline links russia 's gas fields with energy-hungry german consumers under the deal gazprom gets an option on 9 percent of the recently built bbl gas pipeline linking britain and the netherlands .
the agreement was signed in moscow at a ceremony that included dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende and russian president vladimir putin . " the participation of a dutch company in the north european gas pipeline project makes this a truly multilateral project and of course creates better conditions for its realization , " putin said in an interfax news agency report . the deal is seen as good news for the troubled project , which has been plagued by cost overruns , planning delays and opposition from several eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran . " we definitely need germany 's help in problems like iran so that we can solve the situation diplomatically , " he said wednesday in rtl / n-tv television interview .
" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france .

merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .

these words must be backed up by deeds .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran . " we definitely need germany 's help in problems like iran so that we can solve the situation diplomatically , " he said wednesday in rtl / n-tv television interview .
" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france . " " iran must be persuaded to choose the option of cooperation , dialogue and openness ... we will be firm and we will keep up the dialogue , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran . " we definitely need germany 's help in problems like iran so that we can solve the situation diplomatically , " he said wednesday in rtl / n-tv television interview .
" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france . " " iran must be persuaded to choose the option of cooperation , dialogue and openness ... we will be firm and we will keep up the dialogue , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.11.2007 opinion : eu candidate states responsible for bad report card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in the balkans and turkey are progressing too slowly , according to an eu report released this week .
turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran .

" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france .

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran .

" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france .

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion .

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 07.11.2007 monument to 1989 peaceful revolution in germany stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans for a german unity monument have n't quite come together the bundestag is set to discuss a proposed monument to freedom and unity in berlin .
but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .

" distinctly setting himself apart from chirac , sarkozy quipped on tuesday that one can " be a friend of america and win an election in france . " common interests in the middle east during the meeting , bush evoked the countries ' strong historical ties by bringing up marquis de lafayette , a french nobleman who 'd played a key role in the american revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the menu had a historical note at tuesdsay 's dinner " two centuries later , our two nations are honoring the legacy of lafayette by helping others resist tyranny and terror , " said bush , referring to a common interest in seeing success in afghanistan and reconciliation in iraq , as well as putting an end to human rights abuses in darfur and myanmar . " through this cooperation , we can make the world a better place , " bush added . sarkozy may not see eye-to-eye with bush on policy in iraq , but " that does n't influence our friendship , " said the french president , who also hailed us courage after the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 . the two are in agreement , however , on the iran nuclear standoff and paris has repeatedly supported stronger sanctions .

he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

he and bush emphasized their countries ' historical friendship and common interests , despite icy relations over the past few years . after a warm welcome from us president george w. bush , sarkozy said tuesday he 'd come to washington with a very simple message . " i wish to re-conquer the heart of america in a lasting fashion , " he said in a toast before sitting down to a black-tie dinner in the white house . the french president , nicknamed " sarko the american " at home for his pro-us position , said that france and the us shared a " common destiny " as democratic nations that " believe in freedom and are prepared to struggle for freedom together . " sarkozy to address congress in a rare address by a foreign leader , sarkozy is scheduled to speak to both houses of congress on wednesday before joining bush at mount vernon , george washington 's former residence .
iran 's nuclear program and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq are likely to top the leaders ' agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy visited bush at the family estate in maine during his summer vacation differences of opinion over the us invasion of iraq had put a damper on relations between the two countries over the past several years , particularly under former french president jacques chirac .
in an official visit to washington in 2001 , sarkozy 's predecessor had irked the us by hailing france as an antidote to the american " hyper-power . " distinctly setting himself apart from chirac , sarkozy quipped on tuesday that one can " be a friend of america and win an election in france . " common interests in the middle east during the meeting , bush evoked the countries ' strong historical ties by bringing up marquis de lafayette , a french nobleman who 'd played a key role in the american revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the menu had a historical note at tuesdsay 's dinner " two centuries later , our two nations are honoring the legacy of lafayette by helping others resist tyranny and terror , " said bush , referring to a common interest in seeing success in afghanistan and reconciliation in iraq , as well as putting an end to human rights abuses in darfur and myanmar . " through this cooperation , we can make the world a better place , " bush added . sarkozy may not see eye-to-eye with bush on policy in iraq , but " that does n't influence our friendship , " said the french president , who also hailed us courage after the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 . the two are in agreement , however , on the iran nuclear standoff and paris has repeatedly supported stronger sanctions . " the hypothesis of a nuclear weapon in the hands of the current leaders of iran is for france inacceptable , " said sarkozy , adding that civilian nuclear energy is a right , also for iran . sarkozy appeals for stronger dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy urged the us to strengthen its currency prior to the dinner at the white house , sarkozy awarded medals to seven us world war two veterans who had taken part in the normandy invasion in 1944 . he also met with us and french business leaders , where he reiterated his demand for a stronger dollar .
the us currency sunk to $ 1.4571 against the euro tuesday , a new low . " a great national economy needs a strong currency , " sarkozy said . the trip marks sarkozy 's first official visit to washington , though he and bush met informally during the french president 's vacation to maine in august . german chancellor angela merkel will meet bush at his private ranch in texas over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .

in an official visit to washington in 2001 , sarkozy 's predecessor had irked the us by hailing france as an antidote to the american " hyper-power . " distinctly setting himself apart from chirac , sarkozy quipped on tuesday that one can " be a friend of america and win an election in france . " common interests in the middle east during the meeting , bush evoked the countries ' strong historical ties by bringing up marquis de lafayette , a french nobleman who 'd played a key role in the american revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the menu had a historical note at tuesdsay 's dinner " two centuries later , our two nations are honoring the legacy of lafayette by helping others resist tyranny and terror , " said bush , referring to a common interest in seeing success in afghanistan and reconciliation in iraq , as well as putting an end to human rights abuses in darfur and myanmar .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran .

" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france .

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .

after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .

these words must be backed up by deeds .

merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.11.2007 opinion : eu candidate states responsible for bad report card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in the balkans and turkey are progressing too slowly , according to an eu report released this week .
turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2007 study shows one in two germans does not possess assets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most do not live in luxury in germany property ownership and assets in germany are disportionately distributed , a new study shows .
the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.11.2007 opinion : eu candidate states responsible for bad report card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in the balkans and turkey are progressing too slowly , according to an eu report released this week .
turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .

" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !

" i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .

the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran .

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .
only in as far as we acknowledge our responsibility for the moral catastrophe of germany 's history can we build a humane future . "
germany should be judged on actions , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert 's israel can rely on germany , says merkel the chancellor said that germany should not merely pay lip service to these principles but will be judged on how firmly it reacts to breaches inside its borders but also beyond them .
" how firmly do we react when the iranian president wants to destroy israel and to belittle the holocaust ? " she asked .
" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .

the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said .

" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !

" i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda . " these were not the misguided deeds of some psychopath , but instead the result of a political and military leadership , " dahl said . conducting own defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icty in the hague the 53-year-old defendant looked relaxed and confident in court , taking notes and even laughing outright when the prosecution showed a video of him in front of a crowd chanting " serbia !
serbia ! " seselj , who has been in custody in the hague since february 2003 , denies all the charges and , like milosevic before him , has insisted on conducting his own defense . " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of , " he said in a pre-trial hearing tuesday .
" i have no other involvement in these crimes except for what i said or wrote . " a fierce critic of the west , seselj has said he will use the trial to show the existence of an international anti-serb conspiracy involving the european union , germany , nato , the united states and the vatican . the case against seselj in the un court is the first since the milosevic trial to focus on serbia 's involvement in the conflicts in bosnia and croatia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 07.11.2007 monument to 1989 peaceful revolution in germany stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans for a german unity monument have n't quite come together the bundestag is set to discuss a proposed monument to freedom and unity in berlin .
but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran . " we definitely need germany 's help in problems like iran so that we can solve the situation diplomatically , " he said wednesday in rtl / n-tv television interview .
" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france . " " iran must be persuaded to choose the option of cooperation , dialogue and openness ... we will be firm and we will keep up the dialogue , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other baltic sea nations have said the pipeline poses a major risk to the environment . " this initiative , this project , has not been prepared well , " tusk , who is due to be nominated polish prime minister this week , said at a news conference . " i hope and i hear some signals that in the nearest future the sponsors of the project would be ready to seriously correct it , " he added , with providing details . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and the baltic states worry about future supplies .
the undersea pipeline will eventually run 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- from the northwestern russian port of vyborg to the northern german port of greifswald , bypassing current routes through poland , belarus and ukraine . the pipeline has been a source of friction between poland and germany in recent years .
poland has insisted on alternative routes for the link .
one option , called amber , would have the natural gas run through the three baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - and poland before reaching germany . russia is said to be less amenable to this idea , given that its relations with the baltic states and poland are frosty . the pipeline is being built by the russian-led nord stream consortium , which includes russia 's gazprom and german companies basf and e.on. gazprom currently holds 51 percent of the project while e.on and basf each hold a 20-percent stake . dutch participation on tuesday , nov .
6 , russian and dutch officials signed an agreement reported worth 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.24 billion -rrb- to bring the dutch gas giant nederlandse gasunie nv into the project .
the dutch company will have a 9 percent stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline links russia 's gas fields with energy-hungry german consumers under the deal gazprom gets an option on 9 percent of the recently built bbl gas pipeline linking britain and the netherlands .
the agreement was signed in moscow at a ceremony that included dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende and russian president vladimir putin . " the participation of a dutch company in the north european gas pipeline project makes this a truly multilateral project and of course creates better conditions for its realization , " putin said in an interfax news agency report . the deal is seen as good news for the troubled project , which has been plagued by cost overruns , planning delays and opposition from several eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.11.2007 opinion : eu candidate states responsible for bad report card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in the balkans and turkey are progressing too slowly , according to an eu report released this week .
turkey and the balkans have to try harder if they want to join the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union 's report card for candidate countries looks worse than it did last year . eagerness for reform has slipped in the balkans and in turkey .
the democratic forces in serbia are still vulnerable and the political system in bosnia-herzegovina is in crisis .
reforms in macedonia are lagging due to ethnic tension , while the future of kosovo remains uncertain - and so on and so forth . accession negotiations with croatia - the most advanced country - are running according to plan , but even here the problems are so big that there is no possibility of membership before 2009 .
the eu , however , selects its words carefully and speaks of " middle and long-term expansion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert the criticism from brussels may be a blow to some of the affected states , but indeed it 's necessary to uncover the weak points .
the copenhagen criteria for eu accession - " democracy , rule of law , a free market economy , no conflicts with neighboring states " - have to be fulfilled .
eu expansion commissioner olli rehn owes that to the existing member states . however , it 's also important that the eu does n't fundamentally question the idea of membership for the balkan states , from bosnia to albania .
the goal remains .
the european perspective , which should serve as a motor for integration and democratization , is still intact . croatia can serve as an example to the other candidate states of a country that will gradually find its way into the european union , even if the process takes longer than expected . for turkey , the european commission not only had many critical points but also praise .
after all , turkey 's politicians did manage to resolve the constitutional crisis surrounding the presidential election without the involvement of the military .
the role of the military must be cut back even further , however , if turkey wants to meet european standards . in general , reform in turkey has slackened . freedom of speech , religious freedom and minority rights are still inadequate .
this admonition is nothing new ; turkish prime minister erdogan 's criticism that the eu continually invents new rules in the middle of the game is completely inappropriate .
the eu has to demand the implementation of a european legal standard if turkey ever wants to join . the rules are n't new at all - they were accepted by the turkish government when accession talks began in 2005 . turkey is predominantly responsible for blocking the accession negotiations .
eight of 35 negotiation chapters remain closed , while ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to cyprus , an eu member state .
as far as the cyprus issue goes , no progress has been made over the past year . the report card from brussels provides further munitions to the notorious opponents of eu membership for turkey .
france 's lively president sarkozy , for example , will continue to fight against turkish accession . and if turkey marches into northern iraq to dispose of the pkk , they would do the membership opponents a big favor as an attack in iraq would go against eu norms . the speed and success of accession negotiations depend on the candidate countries themselves . the eu is making an effort to act fairly , but it 's also learned a thing or two from past expansion rounds .
premature membership can lead to a backlash .
for example , in romania , which joined the bloc in 2007 despite major reservations , anti-corruption efforts came to a halt just a few months after accession and now the eu is without leverage . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .
" only by accepting germany 's past can we lay the foundation for the future .

these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .

" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .

6 . ahead of her visit to the united states on friday where talks on further sanctions on iran are likely to dominate proceedings , merkel told a predominantly jewish audience that she felt a moral duty to protect israel and would stand firm in the face of iran 's nuclear ambitions and its threats to wipe the jewish state off the map .
after receiving the leo baeck prize from germany 's central council of jews for her efforts to improve relations between jews and non-jews and between germany and israel , merkel told the audience in berlin that she felt honor-bound to fight racism and to foster close ties between germans and the jewish community .
merkel said that receiving the prize highlighted the responsibility she and germany had for protecting the jewish state .
" it means intervening to protect the safety of israel today and in the future , as well as our common values of democracy and the rule of law , " she said .
" it took more than 40 years for germany as a whole to accept the responsibility it carries to ensure the safety of israel , " she added .

" i believe that in the face of the threat iran 's nuclear program poses to israel , our responsibility must be more than empty words .
these words must be backed up by deeds .
my government will follow its words with action . "
merkel will hold talks with us president george w. bush on how to resolve the iranian crisis .
washington is canvassing its allies for support in its push to obtain harder sanctions on tehran over fears that iran 's nuclear program is a cover for developing atomic weapons , an accusation iran strenuously denies .
chancellor reiterates support for tougher iran sanctions the chancellor reiterated her support for tougher un sanctions against iran if it fails to comply with the demands of the international community to halt sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated germany 's stance in iran at the un " we and our partners are working towards a diplomatic solution , " she said .
" part of this process is a readiness on the part of germany to agree to wider , stricter sanctions if iran does not comply .
" i made this plain in my speech to the united nations at the end of september and i repeat it in all my political consultations and i repeat it here today , " added the chancellor .
germany throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also addressed the current middle east crisis and told the audience in berlin that germany would do all it could to bolster the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between israel and the palestians continue the so-called middle east quartet - the united states , russia , the european union and united nations - will convene with israeli and palestinian officials in annapolis in the us later this month to discuss the peace process at a meeting which merkel called a " major opportunity . "
" the peace conference in annapolis offers a major opportunity to bring movement back into the peace process , " she said .
" everything the german government can do to support this process will be done .
that is why president bush and i will fully discuss the subject during my visit this weekend to texas as well as the next step regarding iran . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . seselj , the leader of serbia 's biggest political party , the serbian radical party , smiled as the charges against him were read out .
he faces three charges of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes related to the 1990s balkan wars , including persecution , deportation , murder and torture . the ultra-nationalist , labeled by prosecutors as the man " who gave the world the term ethnic cleansing , " is also accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with late yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic to " ethnically cleanse " large parts of bosnia , croatia and serbia 's northern vojvodina region during the 1990s balkan wars . prosecutors say he recruited and indoctrinated volunteers and paramilitaries who would go on to commit atrocities in bosnia and croatia .
during the 1991-95 wars in croatia and bosnia , seselj 's party sent its own paramilitaries to the frontlines .
at least five former members of the so-called white eagles are currently on trial in a serbian war crimes court . accused of unspeakable crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav seselj " he advocated violence against non-serbs ... he raised his own army of volunteers ... -lsb- and -rsb- indoctrinated them with his poisonous ideas " and sent them to the front lines were they committed " unspeakable crimes , " prosecutor christine dahl said . " seselj repeatedly called for the ' liberation ' of what he said were serbian lands , unfortunately other people already lived there , people seselj had no use for , " she added .
" in the end seselj did not achieve a greater serbia , he managed to achieve a lesser serbia and gave the world the term ethnic cleansing . " the prosecution stressed that seselj used " tried and true propaganda techniques " to incite his followers to criminal violence and compared the atrocities he is accused of to those committed in nazi germany , cambodia and rwanda .

9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

the richest 10 percent possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , while half of the population has virtually nothing . the study , conducted by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , showed that women , people living in eastern germany and immigrants are the worst off when it comes to property and assets . the study , published by the daily süddeutsche zeitung , showed that germans have total assets of 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- .
the total is composed of savings , property ownership , pension benefits and insurance plans , as well as art and stamp collections .
the total resulted after debts had been calculated out . if the amount were distributed equally among all germans over the age of 17 , each would have an average of 81,000 euros in real capital . however , the diw study showed that assets are not distributed equally .
while the richest 10 percent of the population possess over two-thirds of savings and assets , half of the population has virtually nothing .
the people in the latter group , the study showed , spend most of their money on goods and amortizing debts . eastern-western split in wealth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have to resort to soup kitchens furthermore , there is a split between eastern and western germany .
average assets among people living in western germany are 2.6 times higher than among those living in eastern germany - primarily because eastern germans have more debts and fewer own property . generally , women have 30,000 euros less in capital than men , the study showed .
migrants , both in western and eastern germany , have less than half of the average asset sum at their disposal . the study is based on surveys conducted among households that have been questioned annually since 1984 concerning their financial and social situations . the study also showed that higher incomes among the richest germans have led to greater discrepancies among the classes .
the amount of assets composed only of wages has stagnated between 1996 and 2006 ; the portion composed of capital has grown by four percent to around 33.8 percent . bridging the gap markus grabka , the author of the study , said the results showed that " many people residing in germany are basically living from hand to mouth , " as quoted by the der spiegel online news portal .
he said that well-off people had amassed " enormous riches , " and suggested that legislators correct the disparity . however , he warned against a tax on assets , pointing out that the rich would merely relocate their wealth abroad . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .

other baltic sea nations have said the pipeline poses a major risk to the environment . " this initiative , this project , has not been prepared well , " tusk , who is due to be nominated polish prime minister this week , said at a news conference . " i hope and i hear some signals that in the nearest future the sponsors of the project would be ready to seriously correct it , " he added , with providing details . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and the baltic states worry about future supplies .
the undersea pipeline will eventually run 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- from the northwestern russian port of vyborg to the northern german port of greifswald , bypassing current routes through poland , belarus and ukraine . the pipeline has been a source of friction between poland and germany in recent years .
poland has insisted on alternative routes for the link .
one option , called amber , would have the natural gas run through the three baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - and poland before reaching germany . russia is said to be less amenable to this idea , given that its relations with the baltic states and poland are frosty . the pipeline is being built by the russian-led nord stream consortium , which includes russia 's gazprom and german companies basf and e.on. gazprom currently holds 51 percent of the project while e.on and basf each hold a 20-percent stake . dutch participation on tuesday , nov .

the dutch company will have a 9 percent stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline links russia 's gas fields with energy-hungry german consumers under the deal gazprom gets an option on 9 percent of the recently built bbl gas pipeline linking britain and the netherlands .
the agreement was signed in moscow at a ceremony that included dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende and russian president vladimir putin . " the participation of a dutch company in the north european gas pipeline project makes this a truly multilateral project and of course creates better conditions for its realization , " putin said in an interfax news agency report . the deal is seen as good news for the troubled project , which has been plagued by cost overruns , planning delays and opposition from several eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

but critics say the project may end up commemorating the wrong ideals in the wrong city . the memorial project is primarily aimed at commemorating the peaceful revolution of 1989 , when popular protests by east germans forced the state to open the berlin wall .
that proved to be a pivotal event in the former communist east germany 's rapid demise and germany 's reunification in 1990 . ahead of the parliamentary discussions on friday , nov .
9 , the 18th anniversary of the fall of the wall , a german historical foundation devoted to preserving the often grim memories of the gdr sponsored a contest for german students to come up with possible monument designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remnants of the berlin wall are preserved to remind people of the past bernadette boebel 's winning concept features two steel semicircles placed 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- apart , but which appear to join together when viewed from atop a plaque explaining the events of 1989 . the 25-year-old 's design , together with others from the competition , is intended to serve as an example of what form the memorial could take . while the initiative to create a monument to " freedom and unity " has the support of both germany 's two largest political parties , there is disagreement over whether it should be built in berlin and over precisely what it should commemorate . steel tubes everywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boebel 's design gives an idea of what the monument could look like supporters argue that germany , especially considering the prominence of memorials to the holocaust , also needs to commemorate its democratic traditions and triumphs . " how a country deals with its past speaks volumes about how it sees itself , " bundestag president norbert lammert said at the award ceremony in berlin 's st. nikolai church . but critics say the project focuses on reunification at the expense of other important events and emotions of 1989 . " the design that won first prize is only about national unity , " said luc jochimsen , a cultural spokeswoman for the opposition left party .
" we 've got , god knows , enough of this sort of steel-tube construction elsewhere in germany .
i ca n't see where the idea of freedom plays any role at all . " the left party , which is made up mainly of members of the party that succeeded the east german communist party and some former social democrats , plans to suggest alternative commemoration ideas on friday that party members said would emphasize the original goal of the east germans demonstrations : a desire for civil liberty and freedom from government coercion . choosing a location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in leipzig in the autumn of 1989 changed modern history berlin may have been the setting of the most spectacular scenes from 1989 - east and west germans embracing at border crossings or climbing atop the wall with hammers to pick away at a hated symbol of political oppression - but leipzig , where the mass anti-government demonstrations began , was the actual cradle of the social movement that led to the gdr 's downfall . supporters argue that the monument has to be located in the german capital in order to function as a national statement . " i 'd like to put the courage of the people up on a pedestal , " lammert said at the award ceremony . others , however , would like to see that pedestal erected elsewhere . " we think that berlin is the wrong location , " said jochimsen .
" we think the focus should be on leipzig , not berlin - and on october 9 rather than november 9 . " oct .
9 , 1989 was the date of the first truly mass demonstration in leipzig , and the fact that police did not violently disperse protestors was considered crucial in keeping the confrontation peaceful . monument overkill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will debate on friday whether to commission a monument while the vast majority of people agree that the events of 1989 were good for both germany and the world , the issue of how to commemorate it remains controversial with some observers questioning whether berlin needs another memorial . " hardly any of the memorials and monuments in berlin get the sort of attention their creators intended , " architecture critic nikolaus bernau wrote in the daily berliner zeitung , adding that the demonstrations were unlikely basis for a monument .
" -lsb- the revolution of 1989 -rsb- belongs to those events that have traditionally been celebrated very successfully with festivals and ceremonies , not with monuments .

" the german government hopes and expects that the annapolis meeting will contribute to a breakthrough , " steg said ahead of the meeting . the leaders also planned to discuss the effects developments in iran could have " on the islamic world and on the stability of afghanistan and pakistan , " he added .
riyadh is pushing a middle east peace plan it drew up five years ago which was revived at an arab summit in saudi arabia in march .
it offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 six day war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . observers have said saudi arabia could work as a mediator between the palestinians and israelis , if riyadh and the west speak with a united voice . merkel , bush push diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush both said they will work to negotiate an agreement with iran merkel 's meeting with the king comes before her talks with us president george w. bush in texas , whom she is expected to brief on what she heard from abdullah .
merkel has said she will urge bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iranian nuclear crisis . " i want a diplomatic solution and i will make every effort to achieve it , " merkel said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
" i am sure that the us president will lend me his ear . " friday 's meeting between bush and merkel will come on the heels of an announcement from iran that its nuclear program reached a key milestone wednesday of 3,000 centrifuges operating to enrich uranium . the number is important because scientists say that in ideal conditions it is sufficient to produce enough enriched uranium in one year to make a nuclear bomb .
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in august that iran had 1,968 running to enrich uranium and that 656 others were either under construction or being tested .
it is unclear when it obtained the remaining centrifuges . iran maintains energy production is the sole goal of its nuclear program while the west says the country may be working toward creating nuclear weapons . key role for germany , support from france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy spoke to the entire us congress , a rare honor for non-americans bush said germany would play an important role in reaching a peaceful solution with tehran . " we definitely need germany 's help in problems like iran so that we can solve the situation diplomatically , " he said wednesday in rtl / n-tv television interview .
" that 's going to be an important topic with the chancellor . " washington insists it wants a diplomatic solution , but at the same time has not ruled out a military option .
bush has said " world war iii " and a " nuclear holocaust " could arise from iran acquiring nuclear weapons . the standoff with iran also played an important role in discussions between bush and french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday . the french leader affirmed his strong support of the us drive to deprive iran of atomic weapons , saying to applause during a joint session of us congress that " the prospect of a nuclear-armed is unacceptable to france . " " iran must be persuaded to choose the option of cooperation , dialogue and openness ... we will be firm and we will keep up the dialogue , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other baltic sea nations have said the pipeline poses a major risk to the environment . " this initiative , this project , has not been prepared well , " tusk , who is due to be nominated polish prime minister this week , said at a news conference . " i hope and i hear some signals that in the nearest future the sponsors of the project would be ready to seriously correct it , " he added , with providing details . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and the baltic states worry about future supplies .
the undersea pipeline will eventually run 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- from the northwestern russian port of vyborg to the northern german port of greifswald , bypassing current routes through poland , belarus and ukraine . the pipeline has been a source of friction between poland and germany in recent years .
poland has insisted on alternative routes for the link .
one option , called amber , would have the natural gas run through the three baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - and poland before reaching germany . russia is said to be less amenable to this idea , given that its relations with the baltic states and poland are frosty . the pipeline is being built by the russian-led nord stream consortium , which includes russia 's gazprom and german companies basf and e.on. gazprom currently holds 51 percent of the project while e.on and basf each hold a 20-percent stake . dutch participation on tuesday , nov .
6 , russian and dutch officials signed an agreement reported worth 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.24 billion -rrb- to bring the dutch gas giant nederlandse gasunie nv into the project .
the dutch company will have a 9 percent stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline links russia 's gas fields with energy-hungry german consumers under the deal gazprom gets an option on 9 percent of the recently built bbl gas pipeline linking britain and the netherlands .
the agreement was signed in moscow at a ceremony that included dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende and russian president vladimir putin . " the participation of a dutch company in the north european gas pipeline project makes this a truly multilateral project and of course creates better conditions for its realization , " putin said in an interfax news agency report . the deal is seen as good news for the troubled project , which has been plagued by cost overruns , planning delays and opposition from several eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdominal aortic aneurysm , which causes one of the body 's main blood vessels to weaken and burst , is the third most common cause of death for older men .
few outside the medical profession are aware of the condition , but the vascular society is calling for men in their mid 60s to be screened for it .
all four uk health departments are considering the matter at the moment .
campaigners say that checking whether men have a risk of a burst blood vessel in their stomach would cost half the price of the breast cancer screening programme - and would save as many lives - at least 3,000 a year .
the abdominal aorta carries blood to the intestines and other organs nearby .
aneurysms , which mean the arteries weaken , are common in this part of the body .
it is catastrophic when they burst , with most patients dying before they can get to emergency care .
at guy 's and st thomas ' nhs foundation trust in london , doctors are impatient to get on with screening , and are about to begin their own programme .
a vascular surgeon , matthew waltham , applied to guy 's and st thomas ' charity to get a three-year grant for screening .
he expects to see about 40 patients a week from two boroughs in south london .
he said : " screening is relatively simple .
all that is involved is a straightforward ultrasound scan .
" we hope this pilot service will increase detection and early treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms to help save lives and reduce the burden on hospital time and resources . "
the vascular society , which represents specialists in this area , wants to see such schemes offered everywhere .
the society 's honorary secretary , jonothan earnshaw , works in gloucestershire where a screening programme has been running since 1990 .
he accused ministers of unnecessary delays in implementing a full screening programme .
mr earnshaw said : " ruptured aneurysm is a common and deeply painful way to die .
" uk patients have been left waiting for this .
aaa screening has been recommended by the independent national screening committee , but the department of health are dragging their feet on implementation . "
a department of health spokesman responded : " we fully appreciate the serious nature of this condition .
" work is in progress to assess the implications of implementing aaa screening in england .
" this assessment has to take account of the likely impact on existing healthcare services and the infrastructure and staffing requirements for a programme . "

abdominal aortic aneurysm , which causes one of the body 's main blood vessels to weaken and burst , is the third most common cause of death for older men .
few outside the medical profession are aware of the condition , but the vascular society is calling for men in their mid 60s to be screened for it .
all four uk health departments are considering the matter at the moment .
campaigners say that checking whether men have a risk of a burst blood vessel in their stomach would cost half the price of the breast cancer screening programme - and would save as many lives - at least 3,000 a year .
the abdominal aorta carries blood to the intestines and other organs nearby .
aneurysms , which mean the arteries weaken , are common in this part of the body .
it is catastrophic when they burst , with most patients dying before they can get to emergency care .
at guy 's and st thomas ' nhs foundation trust in london , doctors are impatient to get on with screening , and are about to begin their own programme .
a vascular surgeon , matthew waltham , applied to guy 's and st thomas ' charity to get a three-year grant for screening .
he expects to see about 40 patients a week from two boroughs in south london .
he said : " screening is relatively simple .
all that is involved is a straightforward ultrasound scan .
" we hope this pilot service will increase detection and early treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms to help save lives and reduce the burden on hospital time and resources . "
the vascular society , which represents specialists in this area , wants to see such schemes offered everywhere .
the society 's honorary secretary , jonothan earnshaw , works in gloucestershire where a screening programme has been running since 1990 .
he accused ministers of unnecessary delays in implementing a full screening programme .
mr earnshaw said : " ruptured aneurysm is a common and deeply painful way to die .
" uk patients have been left waiting for this .
aaa screening has been recommended by the independent national screening committee , but the department of health are dragging their feet on implementation . "
a department of health spokesman responded : " we fully appreciate the serious nature of this condition .
" work is in progress to assess the implications of implementing aaa screening in england .
" this assessment has to take account of the likely impact on existing healthcare services and the infrastructure and staffing requirements for a programme . "

net profit grew 11 % in the three months to the end of september to 450.9bn yen -lrb- $ 4.0bn ; £ 1.9bn -rrb- .
high petrol prices have increased demand for toyota 's hybrid cars such as the prius and also for small cars such as the camry .
sales in north america , europe , emerging markets and the rest of asia were strong , making up for stubbornly stagnant sales in japan .
some analysts are worried that toyota 's exposure to the us market could be a problem given the state of the us economy .
" in the united states , sub-prime problems could negatively impact auto loans , " said takeshi osawa from norinchukin zenkyoren asset management .
" if that happens , even competitive japanese cars may need more incentives , " he added .
toyota also announced it would buy back up to 110bn yen -lrb- $ 966m ; £ 461m -rrb- worth of shares this month .

some are working in what used to be one of the bedrooms , and the others are in the former sitting room .
they are the vanguard of an industry in kenya that is waiting to take off .
they are employees of preciss international , an out-sourcing company run by mugure mugo .
she set up the company five years ago with one colleague .
" i did the marketing and contract work , my one employee did the data processing , " she says .
" i checked it in the evening and we sent it off the following day to the client . "
right ingredients her office , by the way , is what used to be a guest bedroom in the apartment .
we are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite .
this is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth preciss 's mugure mugo since those early days the business has expanded and is about to grow bigger still with the backing of an investor .
kenya has all the right ingredients for outsourcing work , except one : communication speeds .
" we are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite , " ms mugo says .
" this is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth . "
preciss international has a young , very well-educated workforce and have picked up a big multinational client along with a host of smaller ones .
in the bedroom , a " data clean-up " exercise is taking place , where preciss employees are calling companies all over africa , checking on names , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses .
next door in the sitting room , three people are working on subtitling american and british television programmes for the deaf .
" it 's good business , " says ms mugure , " but it takes ages to download the programmes , and that adds to our costs . "
welcome the price of satellite bandwidth is prohibitively high in kenya and other east african countries .
students like sami seram are frustrated by slow costly web access a megabyte of satellite-delivered bandwidth in kenya costs around $ 7,500 , whereas elsewhere in the world a megabyte costs no more than about $ 400 .
this huge price difference has been a brake on many other businesses as well .
it has taken a long time , but at last slow connection speeds and expensive internet access are about to end in kenya .
in the next few days , the kenyan government will sign a deal with a french / us engineering company alcatel-lucent , to commission a fibre-optic cable from fujaira in the united arab emirates along the sea floor of the gulf of oman , down the east african coast to the port town of mombasa .
from mombasa , the government plans to weave a network of fibre-optic cable throughout the country .
it will be welcomed with open arms in the browse internet access cafe in the centre of nairobi , where dozens of people are sitting in front of their flat-screens tapping away at the keyboards .
snail 's pace the internet speeds at the cafe are fast by nairobi standards and reliable , but painfully slow compared to what should be available .
these young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them bitange ndemo from kenya 's communication ministry sami seram is a student .
he comes to browse because the computers at his university are even worse , but he finds doing his bio-chemistry online research very slow going .
i watched him , waiting while a relatively straightforward page of script was downloading .
" look at this , " he says .
" it 's so slow .
it takes me a very long time to get hold of what i need , and it 's very expensive . "
mr seram reckons he spends about 500 kenyan shillings a week on internet connections - that is about $ 7.50 .
in a country where the average annual wage is less than $ 1,500 , this amounts to a substantial outlay , particularly for a student .
stephen onyambu , the boss of browse says with the cost of satellite bandwidth so high it is impossible to offer internet access any cheaper .
" we have had to cut our margins down and down , " he says .
" but wait , once the fibre optic comes we will be charging just a few cents for internet time . "
' massive change ' work on laying the fibre-optic cable is due to start at the end of the year .
the ocean floor has been surveyed and now the huge pipe must be laid in an $ 82m operation .
alcatel-lucent have committed to finish the project in two years .
bitange ndemo , permanent secretary at the kenyan ministry of communication and information , says they won the contract on cost and speed of delivery .
he says neighbouring countries and territories like ethiopia , southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo have already asked to be connected .
he is optimistic about what the fibre-optic cable will deliver to kenyan business , but the real prize , he thinks , is to be found in rural kenya .
" for the youth here - this is going to be such a massive change , " he says .
" many villages in kenya are being put on the electricity for the first time , and we will give these villages internet access as well .
" suddenly , these young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them . "
it is an enticing prospect but , realistically , it will still be a long time before kenya is all hooked up to the worldwide web .

bitange ndemo , permanent secretary at the kenyan ministry of communication and information , says they won the contract on cost and speed of delivery .
he says neighbouring countries and territories like ethiopia , southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo have already asked to be connected .
he is optimistic about what the fibre-optic cable will deliver to kenyan business , but the real prize , he thinks , is to be found in rural kenya .
" for the youth here - this is going to be such a massive change , " he says .
" many villages in kenya are being put on the electricity for the first time , and we will give these villages internet access as well .
" suddenly , these young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them . "
it is an enticing prospect but , realistically , it will still be a long time before kenya is all hooked up to the worldwide web .

some are working in what used to be one of the bedrooms , and the others are in the former sitting room .
they are the vanguard of an industry in kenya that is waiting to take off .
they are employees of preciss international , an out-sourcing company run by mugure mugo .
she set up the company five years ago with one colleague .
" i did the marketing and contract work , my one employee did the data processing , " she says .
" i checked it in the evening and we sent it off the following day to the client . "
right ingredients her office , by the way , is what used to be a guest bedroom in the apartment .
we are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite .
this is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth preciss 's mugure mugo since those early days the business has expanded and is about to grow bigger still with the backing of an investor .
kenya has all the right ingredients for outsourcing work , except one : communication speeds .
" we are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite , " ms mugo says .
" this is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth . "
preciss international has a young , very well-educated workforce and have picked up a big multinational client along with a host of smaller ones .
in the bedroom , a " data clean-up " exercise is taking place , where preciss employees are calling companies all over africa , checking on names , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses .
next door in the sitting room , three people are working on subtitling american and british television programmes for the deaf .
" it 's good business , " says ms mugure , " but it takes ages to download the programmes , and that adds to our costs . "
welcome the price of satellite bandwidth is prohibitively high in kenya and other east african countries .
students like sami seram are frustrated by slow costly web access a megabyte of satellite-delivered bandwidth in kenya costs around $ 7,500 , whereas elsewhere in the world a megabyte costs no more than about $ 400 .
this huge price difference has been a brake on many other businesses as well .
it has taken a long time , but at last slow connection speeds and expensive internet access are about to end in kenya .
in the next few days , the kenyan government will sign a deal with a french / us engineering company alcatel-lucent , to commission a fibre-optic cable from fujaira in the united arab emirates along the sea floor of the gulf of oman , down the east african coast to the port town of mombasa .
from mombasa , the government plans to weave a network of fibre-optic cable throughout the country .
it will be welcomed with open arms in the browse internet access cafe in the centre of nairobi , where dozens of people are sitting in front of their flat-screens tapping away at the keyboards .
snail 's pace the internet speeds at the cafe are fast by nairobi standards and reliable , but painfully slow compared to what should be available .
these young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them bitange ndemo from kenya 's communication ministry sami seram is a student .
he comes to browse because the computers at his university are even worse , but he finds doing his bio-chemistry online research very slow going .
i watched him , waiting while a relatively straightforward page of script was downloading .
" look at this , " he says .
" it 's so slow .
it takes me a very long time to get hold of what i need , and it 's very expensive . "
mr seram reckons he spends about 500 kenyan shillings a week on internet connections - that is about $ 7.50 .
in a country where the average annual wage is less than $ 1,500 , this amounts to a substantial outlay , particularly for a student .
stephen onyambu , the boss of browse says with the cost of satellite bandwidth so high it is impossible to offer internet access any cheaper .
" we have had to cut our margins down and down , " he says .
" but wait , once the fibre optic comes we will be charging just a few cents for internet time . "
' massive change ' work on laying the fibre-optic cable is due to start at the end of the year .
the ocean floor has been surveyed and now the huge pipe must be laid in an $ 82m operation .
alcatel-lucent have committed to finish the project in two years .
bitange ndemo , permanent secretary at the kenyan ministry of communication and information , says they won the contract on cost and speed of delivery .

the memorial was also the target of vandals who tipped rubbish bins over it at the weekend .

john forsyth , vice president of strategy at symbian , the platform that powers many of the world 's phones , said google lacked experience .
google has formed an alliance with 33 firms to develop an open platform for mobile phones , called android .
meanwhile , the head of nokia in the uk said the firm was in discussions with google about using the platform .
simon ainslie , nokia uk 's managing director , said : " we are always open to discussion and debate on that .
we were not ready to make any commitment to it or discuss it at the time . "
" we are having ongoing discussions with google . "
' very happy ' mr ainslie said the time was not right to make any announcement as to " how we can work with them " .
he also said that nokia was very happy with its partnership with symbian .
he said : " it 's the world 's most used platform .
it 's not a simple solution to make a platform work on a mobile . "
" it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business " john forsyth , symbian , on the open handset alliance mr forsyth said google had to be aware that making a " mobile os is a very specialised form of rocket science .
" it 's not search rocket science . "
he said the alliance was yet another attempt to launch a linux-based operating system to drive mobile phones .
" about every three months this year there has been a mobile linux initiative of some sort launched .
" it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business .
we do n't participate in these full stop .
we make our own platform and we are focused on driving that into the mobile phone market at large ever more aggressively . "
symbian 's recent financial results show it sold 20.4m smartphone software licenses in the last quarter of 2007 and since the company was launched nine years ago more than 165 million phones have been shipped using its platform .
' deeply unsexy ' mr forsyth said there was nothing to indicate that google 's dominance of the web would make it successful as a mobile phone platform provider .
" search and a mobile phone platform are completely different things .
" it 's costly , arduous and at times a deeply unsexy job of supporting customers day by day in launching phones .
that 's something there 's very little experience of in google 's environment . " if you are a serious phone maker and you are asked to bet your handsets on somebody , you would want to bet on someone with a track record of delivery and support . "
mr forsyth also questioned whether developers would flock to the system .
" it 's very clear what developers want - volume and a stable platform that does n't keep breaking .
you have to have a lot of zeroes in your sales figures before a developer gets out of bed .
" they are talking about having a phone by the end of next year .
it 's not one that is going to ignite developers . "

john forsyth , vice president of strategy at symbian , the platform that powers many of the world 's phones , said google lacked experience .
google has formed an alliance with 33 firms to develop an open platform for mobile phones , called android .
meanwhile , the head of nokia in the uk said the firm was in discussions with google about using the platform .
simon ainslie , nokia uk 's managing director , said : " we are always open to discussion and debate on that .
we were not ready to make any commitment to it or discuss it at the time . "
" we are having ongoing discussions with google . "
' very happy ' mr ainslie said the time was not right to make any announcement as to " how we can work with them " .
he also said that nokia was very happy with its partnership with symbian .
he said : " it 's the world 's most used platform .
it 's not a simple solution to make a platform work on a mobile . "
it 's a bit like the common cold .

we do n't participate in these full stop .
we make our own platform and we are focused on driving that into the mobile phone market at large ever more aggressively . "
symbian 's recent financial results show it sold 20.4m smartphone software licenses in the last quarter of 2007 and since the company was launched nine years ago more than 165 million phones have been shipped using its platform .
' deeply unsexy ' mr forsyth said there was nothing to indicate that google 's dominance of the web would make it successful as a mobile phone platform provider .
" search and a mobile phone platform are completely different things .

john forsyth , vice president of strategy at symbian , the platform that powers many of the world 's phones , said google lacked experience .
google has formed an alliance with 33 firms to develop an open platform for mobile phones , called android .
meanwhile , the head of nokia in the uk said the firm was in discussions with google about using the platform .
simon ainslie , nokia uk 's managing director , said : " we are always open to discussion and debate on that .
we were not ready to make any commitment to it or discuss it at the time . "
" we are having ongoing discussions with google . "
' very happy ' mr ainslie said the time was not right to make any announcement as to " how we can work with them " .
he also said that nokia was very happy with its partnership with symbian .
he said : " it 's the world 's most used platform .
it 's not a simple solution to make a platform work on a mobile . "
it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business john forsyth , symbian , on the open handset alliance mr forsyth said google had to be aware that making a " mobile os is a very specialised form of rocket science .
" it 's not search rocket science . "
he said the alliance was yet another attempt to launch a linux-based operating system to drive mobile phones .
" about every three months this year there has been a mobile linux initiative of some sort launched .
" it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business .
we do n't participate in these full stop .
we make our own platform and we are focused on driving that into the mobile phone market at large ever more aggressively . "
symbian 's recent financial results show it sold 20.4m smartphone software licenses in the last quarter of 2007 and since the company was launched nine years ago more than 165 million phones have been shipped using its platform .
' deeply unsexy ' mr forsyth said there was nothing to indicate that google 's dominance of the web would make it successful as a mobile phone platform provider .
" search and a mobile phone platform are completely different things .
" it 's costly , arduous and at times a deeply unsexy job of supporting customers day by day in launching phones .
that 's something there 's very little experience of in google 's environment . " if you are a serious phone maker and you are asked to bet your handsets on somebody , you would want to bet on someone with a track record of delivery and support . "
mr forsyth also questioned whether developers would flock to the system .
" it 's very clear what developers want - volume and a stable platform that does n't keep breaking .
you have to have a lot of zeroes in your sales figures before a developer gets out of bed .
" they are talking about having a phone by the end of next year .
it 's not one that is going to ignite developers . "

john forsyth , vice president of strategy at symbian , the platform that powers many of the world 's phones , said google lacked experience .
google has formed an alliance with 33 firms to develop an open platform for mobile phones , called android .
meanwhile , the head of nokia in the uk said the firm was in discussions with google about using the platform .
simon ainslie , nokia uk 's managing director , said : " we are always open to discussion and debate on that .
we were not ready to make any commitment to it or discuss it at the time . "
" we are having ongoing discussions with google . "
' very happy ' mr ainslie said the time was not right to make any announcement as to " how we can work with them " .
he also said that nokia was very happy with its partnership with symbian .
he said : " it 's the world 's most used platform .
it 's not a simple solution to make a platform work on a mobile . "
it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business john forsyth , symbian , on the open handset alliance mr forsyth said google had to be aware that making a " mobile os is a very specialised form of rocket science .
" it 's not search rocket science . "
he said the alliance was yet another attempt to launch a linux-based operating system to drive mobile phones .
" about every three months this year there has been a mobile linux initiative of some sort launched .
" it 's a bit like the common cold .
it keeps coming round and then we go back to business .
we do n't participate in these full stop .
we make our own platform and we are focused on driving that into the mobile phone market at large ever more aggressively . "
symbian 's recent financial results show it sold 20.4m smartphone software licenses in the last quarter of 2007 and since the company was launched nine years ago more than 165 million phones have been shipped using its platform .
' deeply unsexy ' mr forsyth said there was nothing to indicate that google 's dominance of the web would make it successful as a mobile phone platform provider .
" search and a mobile phone platform are completely different things .
" it 's costly , arduous and at times a deeply unsexy job of supporting customers day by day in launching phones .

sarika singh refused to take off the religious symbol because it is " a constant reminder to do good " .
aberdare girls school said it has a clear code of conduct and it had temporarily excluded a pupil for refusing to accept a governors ' ruling .
the sikh federation uk said that the bangle was an " article of faith " and sikhs had no choice but to wear it .
sarika 's mother sinita singh said she also has the support of several local politicians and was taking legal advice .
she said the teenager would remove the bangle for gym classes , or wood and metalwork , for safety reasons .
mrs singh said : " it 's not jewellery , it 's part of our faith and symbol of our belief . "
she said they had a meeting with the school and argued the case with the board of governors , but they refused to allow her to wear it .
" we feel very strongly that sarika has a right to manifest her religion - she 's not asking for anything big and flashy , she 's not making a big fuss , she just wants a reminder of her religion . "
on monday sarika was excluded for a day and on tuesday her mother said she was told she had been excluded for a fixed period .
sarika said of wearing the bangle : " it 's very important to me , it constantly reminds me to do good and not to do bad , especially with my hands . "
her mother said the sikh federation had supported them and she would do " whatever it takes " .
have your say " children are at school for education and education only .
but what is wrong with wearing a bangle ? "
kayleigh findlay send us your comments the school has confirmed that " a pupil has been temporarily excluded for refusing to accept the decision of the governing body " .
the governors rejected the girl 's request to wear the bangle after a " significant period of research " examining the uniform policy and human rights legislation in detail .
jane rosser , headteacher , said : " we have a strict and clear code of conduct that has been in place for many years .
" a copy of the code of conduct is given to all girls before they are even a pupil at the school and is also issued at the start of every new term in september .
" we use this established code of conduct to ensure equality between all pupils .
" the code clearly states the only two forms of jewellery that girls are allowed to wear in school is a wrist watch and one pair of plain metal stud earrings . "
jagtar singh , secretary of sikh federation uk claimed the school was breaching the 1976 race relations act in its treatment of sarika .
" the department for education and schools in england have said that if a headteacher or governing body were to deny a sikh child one of their articles of faith such as the bangle then they would be breaking the law , " he said .
" if you are a practising sikh , you have no choice , you have to have the kara .
it is the one symbol that virtually every single sikh wears . "

parliament 's lower house , the duma , unanimously agreed to temporarily abandon the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
the bill still faces approval in the upper house in december before president vladimir putin can sign it .
the cfe is one of many issues recently putting moscow at odds with the west .
the duma approved the bill in the 418-0 vote .
the cfe treaty cornerstone of european security limits amount of key military equipment in designated area negotiated by nato and ex-warsaw pact member states signed in 1990 came into force in 1992 revised 1999 version never ratified by nato russia sends warning in the motion , mps said the cfe treaty " no longer responds to the security interests of the russian federation " in light of nato expansion and other factors in europe .
the vote amounted to legislative confirmation of a decree signed by president putin in july .
the cfe was one of the most significant arms control agreements of the cold war years .
it set strict limits on the number of conventional weapons - battle tanks , combat aircraft , heavy artillery - that the members of the warsaw pact and nato could deploy in european territory stretching from the atlantic coast to the urals .
in the wake of the collapse of communism , the treaty was revised in 1999 , in part to address russian concerns .
russia ratified the 1999 revised version , but nato has not done so .
nato states are first demanding the withdrawal of russian forces from georgia and moldova , but moscow says the issues are not linked .
the kremlin has also voiced concern over us plans to station part of a missile defence shield in poland and the czech republic .

nobuo tanaka , executive director of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , said such a rise would threaten energy security and accelerate climate change .
he said energy needs in 2030 could be more than 50 % above current levels , with fossil fuels still dominant .
mr tanaka was speaking at the launch of the iea 's world energy outlook report .
rapid economic growth in china and india would be the main drivers behind the rise , he said as he unveiled the agency 's annual flagship publication .
" the emergence of new major players in global energy markets means that all countries must take vigorous , immediate and collective action to curb runaway energy demand , " he warned .
" rapid economic development will undoubtedly continue to drive up energy demand in china and india , and will contribute to a real improvement in the quality of life for more than two billion people .
" this is a legitimate aspiration that needs to be accommodated and supported by the rest of the world . "
rising emissions the world energy outlook 2007 report warned that much of the increased demand for energy would be met by coal .
china ' to be top energy user ' as a result , energy-related carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could rise by 57 % - from 27 giga-tonnes in 2005 to 42 giga-tonnes in 2030 , it said .
even in the report 's " alternative policy scenario " , which takes into account the governments ' proposed action to save energy and cut emissions , co2 levels are set to rise by 25 % .
but it offered a glimmer of hope within its " 450 stabilisation " case study .
it described a notional strategy for governments to stabilise co2 levels in the atmosphere at about 450 parts per million -lrb- ppm -rrb- , which some scientists and policy makers suggest is an acceptable concentration .
" emissions savings come from improved efficiency in industry , buildings and transport , switching to nuclear power and renewables , and the widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage , " the report said .
this approach would see global emissions peak in 2012 then fall sharply below 2005 levels by 2030 , it suggested .
but it added : " exceptionally quick and vigourous policy action by all countries , and unprecedented technological advances , entailing substantial costs , would be needed to make this case a reality . "
mr tanaka stressed the need for urgency in the battle against climate change : " we need to act now to bring about a radical shift in investment in favour of cleaner , more efficient and more secure energy technologies . "
the uk 's energy secretary , john hutton , endorsed the iea 's findings and agreed that urgent action by politicians was needed .
" as the iea states , it is a lack of international political will , not technological innovation , that is preventing us from reducing emissions while securing energy supplies to power our homes and businesses for the years ahead , " he told bbc news .
" the uk must continue to lead by example by embracing innovation while also ensuring it takes advantage of existing low carbon technologies .
" we share view that there should be the broadest possible energy mix and will be carefully examining the recommendations of this report as we prepare to introduce our energy bill . "

nobuo tanaka , executive director of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , said such a rise would threaten energy security and accelerate climate change .
he said energy needs in 2030 could be more than 50 % above current levels , with fossil fuels still dominant .
mr tanaka was speaking at the launch of the iea 's world energy outlook report .
rapid economic growth in china and india would be the main drivers behind the rise , he said as he unveiled the agency 's annual flagship publication .
" the emergence of new major players in global energy markets means that all countries must take vigorous , immediate and collective action to curb runaway energy demand , " he warned .
" rapid economic development will undoubtedly continue to drive up energy demand in china and india , and will contribute to a real improvement in the quality of life for more than two billion people .
" this is a legitimate aspiration that needs to be accommodated and supported by the rest of the world . "
rising emissions the world energy outlook 2007 report warned that much of the increased demand for energy would be met by coal .
china ' to be top energy user ' as a result , energy-related carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could rise by 57 % - from 27 giga-tonnes in 2005 to 42 giga-tonnes in 2030 , it said .
even in the report 's " alternative policy scenario " , which takes into account the governments ' proposed action to save energy and cut emissions , co2 levels are set to rise by 25 % .
but it offered a glimmer of hope within its " 450 stabilisation " case study .
it described a notional strategy for governments to stabilise co2 levels in the atmosphere at about 450 parts per million -lrb- ppm -rrb- , which some scientists and policy makers suggest is an acceptable concentration .
" emissions savings come from improved efficiency in industry , buildings and transport , switching to nuclear power and renewables , and the widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage , " the report said .
this approach would see global emissions peak in 2012 then fall sharply below 2005 levels by 2030 , it suggested .
but it added : " exceptionally quick and vigourous policy action by all countries , and unprecedented technological advances , entailing substantial costs , would be needed to make this case a reality . "
mr tanaka stressed the need for urgency in the battle against climate change : " we need to act now to bring about a radical shift in investment in favour of cleaner , more efficient and more secure energy technologies . "
the uk 's energy secretary , john hutton , endorsed the iea 's findings and agreed that urgent action by politicians was needed .
" as the iea states , it is a lack of international political will , not technological innovation , that is preventing us from reducing emissions while securing energy supplies to power our homes and businesses for the years ahead , " he told bbc news .
" the uk must continue to lead by example by embracing innovation while also ensuring it takes advantage of existing low carbon technologies .
" we share view that there should be the broadest possible energy mix and will be carefully examining the recommendations of this report as we prepare to introduce our energy bill . "

caught on film by an early camera trap india is lining up a " tiger protection force " to try to prevent poachers forcing the animal into extinction .
new figures put numbers at less than 1,500 .
but how do experts count the big cats ?
as any visitor to india 's wildernesses will tell you , the beautiful bengal tiger is an elusive beast .
you might hear one , see its droppings or spot its footprints in the mud , but few clap eyes on one .
even for experts , arriving at an accurate estimate of their numbers is a huge challenge .
first they have to find the tigers , or evidence of them , then be sure they have n't counted the same one twice .
with tiger numbers at such a critical low , it is crucial to know how many remain .
the answer camera traps that take a picture of the tiger are being used again , along with other tactics " you need 30 to 40 breeding females and 10 to 20 males to form a viable population , " says valmik thapar , one of india 's leading conservationists .
" otherwise in-breeding becomes a problem . "
the authorities also need to gain a clear picture of the extent of poaching - the biggest threat to tigers .
the latest figures are based on data collected using a variety of techniques from radio-collaring to camera trapping .
numbers are gathered for an area of 100sq km then extrapolated to give an estimate for a wider area .
caught on film camera trapping - getting the animal to set off a camera to take a picture of itself - was pioneered in the 1920s by englishman fw champion , a forester with the imperial forestry service in india .
a tripwire triggers the camera using tripwires and flash , champion obtained dozens of remarkable photographs of tigers at night , as well as other passing wildlife .
champion was fascinated by tigers and hated having to issue permits to dignitaries who came to his area of forest to shoot them .
" he often gave out permits for areas where he knew there were n't any tigers , " says his grandson james champion , who is researching his grandfather 's life for a book .
a rare early conservationist who detailed his experiences with tigers in two books still used by foresters today , champion recognised that with good photographs of the animals , it was possible to tell individuals apart by their different stripe patterns .
but since tigers numbered tens of thousands at the time , there was little need for counting and the idea of using photography for that purpose seems to have been lost in the mists of time .
who , what , why ?
a regular part of the bbc news magazine , who , what , why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines by the 70s tiger numbers had been decimated by hunting , habitat loss and poaching .
then prime minister indira gandhi outlawed hunting and launched project tiger in an effort to save india 's most impressive beast .
scientists involved in the project used a technique called the " pugmark method " - taking plastercasts of tiger footprints and measuring them - to provide data on the tiger population .
but the technique had many pitfalls ; it 's difficult to get a good foot impression in hard soil or by a waterhole , and how to tell how many cubs in a litter when all their footprints would be roughly the same size ?
thirty years on , many experts began to realise using pugmarks alone was unreliable and began arguing for more sophisticated means .
camera trapping came back into fashion .
each tiger has different stripes now cameras are set off by more advanced methods than champion 's tripwires , and photos show both sides of the animal , making identifying and comparing them much easier .
using these photos along with signals sent by radio collars , conservationists behind the recent national survey in india have gained more accurate data than ever before and the sad truth has emerged - a tiger population that many fear is on the brink of dying out .
" i had a meeting with the prime minster -lsb- manmohan singh -rsb- the other day and i did n't mince my words one tiny bit .
i told him we are heading for extinction , so let 's see what happens , " says valmik thapar .
fw champion would doubtless be delighted to know camera trapping is being used again , but horrified that numbers have dropped so low .

but how do experts count the big cats ?
as any visitor to india 's wildernesses will tell you , the beautiful bengal tiger is an elusive beast .
you might hear one , see its droppings or spot its footprints in the mud , but few clap eyes on one .
even for experts , arriving at an accurate estimate of their numbers is a huge challenge .
first they have to find the tigers , or evidence of them , then be sure they have n't counted the same one twice .
with tiger numbers at such a critical low , it is crucial to know how many remain .
the answer camera traps that take a picture of the tiger are being used again , along with other tactics " you need 30 to 40 breeding females and 10 to 20 males to form a viable population , " says valmik thapar , one of india 's leading conservationists .
" otherwise in-breeding becomes a problem . "
the authorities also need to gain a clear picture of the extent of poaching - the biggest threat to tigers .
the latest figures are based on data collected using a variety of techniques from radio-collaring to camera trapping .
numbers are gathered for an area of 100sq km then extrapolated to give an estimate for a wider area .
caught on film camera trapping - getting the animal to set off a camera to take a picture of itself - was pioneered in the 1920s by englishman fw champion , a forester with the imperial forestry service in india .
a tripwire triggers the camera using tripwires and flash , champion obtained dozens of remarkable photographs of tigers at night , as well as other passing wildlife .
champion was fascinated by tigers and hated having to issue permits to dignitaries who came to his area of forest to shoot them .
" he often gave out permits for areas where he knew there were n't any tigers , " says his grandson james champion , who is researching his grandfather 's life for a book .
a rare early conservationist who detailed his experiences with tigers in two books still used by foresters today , champion recognised that with good photographs of the animals , it was possible to tell individuals apart by their different stripe patterns .
but since tigers numbered tens of thousands at the time , there was little need for counting and the idea of using photography for that purpose seems to have been lost in the mists of time .
who , what , why ?
a regular part of the bbc news magazine , who , what , why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines by the 70s tiger numbers had been decimated by hunting , habitat loss and poaching .
then prime minister indira gandhi outlawed hunting and launched project tiger in an effort to save india 's most impressive beast .
scientists involved in the project used a technique called the " pugmark method " - taking plastercasts of tiger footprints and measuring them - to provide data on the tiger population .
but the technique had many pitfalls ; it 's difficult to get a good foot impression in hard soil or by a waterhole , and how to tell how many cubs in a litter when all their footprints would be roughly the same size ?
thirty years on , many experts began to realise using pugmarks alone was unreliable and began arguing for more sophisticated means .
camera trapping came back into fashion .
each tiger has different stripes now cameras are set off by more advanced methods than champion 's tripwires , and photos show both sides of the animal , making identifying and comparing them much easier .
using these photos along with signals sent by radio collars , conservationists behind the recent national survey in india have gained more accurate data than ever before and the sad truth has emerged - a tiger population that many fear is on the brink of dying out .
" i had a meeting with the prime minster -lsb- manmohan singh -rsb- the other day and i did n't mince my words one tiny bit .
i told him we are heading for extinction , so let 's see what happens , " says valmik thapar .
fw champion would doubtless be delighted to know camera trapping is being used again , but horrified that numbers have dropped so low .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- gaze ' key to facial attraction ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes wednesday , 7 november 2007 , 10:59 gmt gaze ' key to facial attraction ' you can alter your attraction to the opposite sex simply by looking straight at them and smiling , research suggests .
a study of hundreds of volunteers at stirling and aberdeen universities found averting the eyes even a fraction can make you appear less attractive .
in the royal society 's proceedings b journal , they say the direction of gaze plays a role alongside a symmetrical face or healthy skin .
an expert said it may stop people wasting energy on pointless courtships . "
it suggests that how attractive you find someone is governed partly by how likely you are to be successful " professor ruth mace university college london the study used pictures of male and female faces which had been subtly digitally manipulated .
in one picture , a woman might be looking straight at the camera , while in the next , a tiny adjustment meant she would be looking marginally to the left or right .
the difference was so small that it was not immediately obvious to the viewer .
however , after these pictures were shown to 460 men and women , who were asked to rate them for " attractiveness " , it became clear that it was having a pronounced subliminal effect .
in some pictures , there was an eight-fold difference in ratings between the " straight to camera " and averted gazes .
while many studies have found links between face shape , expression and other physical " cues " to attraction , this is one of the first to look in more detail at the direction of gaze .
the researchers wrote : " mating effort is a finite resource that should be allocated judiciously , and preferences for direct gaze in opposite-sex faces would increase the likelihood of allocating mating effort to potential mates who are most likely to reciprocate . "
success stakes one of the paper 's authors , dr claire conway , said : " people prefer faces that appear to ' like ' them , showing that attraction is not simply about physical beauty . "
professor ruth mace , a researcher into evolutionary anthropology at university college london , said that while this seemed an obvious principle , it could be a sign of evolution at work .
she said : " it 's a pretty clear signal whether a person is interested in you or whether you are wasting your time .
" but it suggests that how attractive you find someone is governed partly by how likely you are to be successful . "

computer manufacturer quanta has started building the low-cost laptops at a factory in changshu , china .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- , the group behind the project , said that children in developing countries would begin receiving machines this month last month , olpc received its first official order for 100,000 machines from the government of uruguay .
" today represents an important milestone in the evolution of the one laptop per child project , " said nicholas negroponte , founder of olpc .
the organisation had reached the critical stage despite " all the naysayers , " he said .
price hike since professor negroponte first put forward the idea of distributing low-cost laptop to children in developing countries in 2002 , the plan has been both praised and mocked .
intel chairman craig barret described the xo laptop , as the machine is known , as a " $ 100 gadget " whilst microsoft founder bill gates questioned its lack of hard drive and " tiny screen " .
other critics have questioned the need for the laptops in countries which , they said , had more pressing needs such as sanitation and health care .
but professor negroponte has always maintained that the project is about education not technology .
however , the green and white xo machines pack a number of innovations which make them suitable for use in remote and environmentally hostile areas .
the machine has no moving parts and can be easily maintained .
it has a sunlight-readable display that allows children to use it outside and , importantly for areas with little access to electricity , it is ultra low power and can be charged by a variety of devices including solar panels .
although olpc eventually plan to sell the machines for $ 100 or less , the current price is $ 188 -lrb- £ 93 -rrb- .
christmas gift initially olpc has said that it required three million orders of the xo to make production viable .
uruguay is the first country to order the machines governments were originally offered the machines in lots of 250,000 .
so far , however , the organisation 's only confirmed order is from uruguay .
the south american country has ordered 100,000 of the machines with an option to purchase a further 300,000 .
other governments have expressed interest in the machines .
for example , the government of mongolia has announced that it plans to launch a pilot project providing 20,000 laptops , to children aged six to 12 .

us assistant secretary of state for population , refugees and migration , ellen sauerbrey , says the refugee leaders in the camps are to blame .
nepal is home to about 107,000 ethnic nepalese expelled from bhutan , which says they are illegal immigrants .
the us has said it will take 60,000 refugees , but says it can take more .
" there is no question that severe intimidation began in the camps when the us made the offer of resettlement , " ms sauerbrey told the bbc .
' intimidation ' she was stopping over in the city of calcutta on way to delhi after a tour of nepal and bhutan .
ms sauerbrey blamed the refugee leaders in the camps in nepal for the " intimidation " .
" for those who have spent 17 years trying to develop a programme to return to bhutan , the idea that a large number of the refugees will come to the us reduces their political power , " she said .
" the refugees have also been fed on false rumours consistently . "
leaders of these bhutanese refugees have been trying to organise them for a long march back home through india .
but delhi - which has very friendly relations with thimphu - has deployed border guards and police to foil these marches .
the refugees have been living in nepal since the 1990s ms sauerbrey says the government of nepal must provide " adequate security " in the refugee camps , so that the unhcr can provide resettlement information to the refugees and enlist those who voluntarily come forward to accept the offer .
" if there 's enough security in the camps , i am confident most of these refugees would take up the offer of resettlement in the us , " ms sauerbrey said .
she said the us was interested in resettling 60,000 of the refugees over five years , but there was no limit and no quota to the us offer .
" if more than 60,000 people are interested in being resettled and are referred to our programme by unhcr , we will take those who qualify .
" most will qualify unless someone has a record of violence in the camp , " she said .
resettlement " we do not take these people because they are highly skilled or educated , we will take them for humanitarian considerations . "
ms sauerbrey , who visited kathmandu and the refugee camps in eastern nepal before travelling to bhutan , said the process was formally launched after nepalese officials went to the camps with her delegation and announced publicly the nepalese government 's support of the resettlement programmes .
she said 3,000 refugees have already applied informally for resettlement in the us .
" our goal this year is to interview about 15,000 and , in the next few years , we are expecting 20,000 to 25,000 per year , based on the interest generated amongst the refugees , " she added .
bhutan says the refugees in nepal are illegal immigrants ms sauerbrey said the us government was keen to resolve the protracted refugee situation on humanitarian grounds .
" if you have been to refugee camps , they are not nice places and these people have been in the camps for 17 years .
that is a long , long time , " she said .
ms sauerbrey said the resettlement could resolve a major part of the problem but there were people in the camps who were genuinely bhutanese citizens and would very much like to come home .
" the us and many other international communities do believe that bhutan has a moral obligation with people who are genuinely bhutanese citizens , to let them come home , " she said .
tens of thousand of bhutanese of nepali origin started fleeing the kingdom in the 1990s , complaining of persecution by the royal administration .
they found refuge in the camps in eastern nepal , run by the unhcr .
several rounds of talks between nepal and bhutan have failed to resolve the issue .

us assistant secretary of state for population , refugees and migration , ellen sauerbrey , says the refugee leaders in the camps are to blame .
nepal is home to about 107,000 ethnic nepalese expelled from bhutan , which says they are illegal immigrants .
the us has said it will take 60,000 refugees , but says it can take more .
" there is no question that severe intimidation began in the camps when the us made the offer of resettlement , " ms sauerbrey told the bbc .
' intimidation ' she was stopping over in the city of calcutta on way to delhi after a tour of nepal and bhutan .
ms sauerbrey blamed the refugee leaders in the camps in nepal for the " intimidation " .
" for those who have spent 17 years trying to develop a programme to return to bhutan , the idea that a large number of the refugees will come to the us reduces their political power , " she said .
" the refugees have also been fed on false rumours consistently . "
leaders of these bhutanese refugees have been trying to organise them for a long march back home through india .
but delhi - which has very friendly relations with thimphu - has deployed border guards and police to foil these marches .
the refugees have been living in nepal since the 1990s ms sauerbrey says the government of nepal must provide " adequate security " in the refugee camps , so that the unhcr can provide resettlement information to the refugees and enlist those who voluntarily come forward to accept the offer .
" if there 's enough security in the camps , i am confident most of these refugees would take up the offer of resettlement in the us , " ms sauerbrey said .
she said the us was interested in resettling 60,000 of the refugees over five years , but there was no limit and no quota to the us offer .
" if more than 60,000 people are interested in being resettled and are referred to our programme by unhcr , we will take those who qualify .
" most will qualify unless someone has a record of violence in the camp , " she said .
resettlement " we do not take these people because they are highly skilled or educated , we will take them for humanitarian considerations . "
ms sauerbrey , who visited kathmandu and the refugee camps in eastern nepal before travelling to bhutan , said the process was formally launched after nepalese officials went to the camps with her delegation and announced publicly the nepalese government 's support of the resettlement programmes .
she said 3,000 refugees have already applied informally for resettlement in the us .
" our goal this year is to interview about 15,000 and , in the next few years , we are expecting 20,000 to 25,000 per year , based on the interest generated amongst the refugees , " she added .
bhutan says the refugees in nepal are illegal immigrants ms sauerbrey said the us government was keen to resolve the protracted refugee situation on humanitarian grounds .
" if you have been to refugee camps , they are not nice places and these people have been in the camps for 17 years .
that is a long , long time , " she said .
ms sauerbrey said the resettlement could resolve a major part of the problem but there were people in the camps who were genuinely bhutanese citizens and would very much like to come home .
" the us and many other international communities do believe that bhutan has a moral obligation with people who are genuinely bhutanese citizens , to let them come home , " she said .
tens of thousand of bhutanese of nepali origin started fleeing the kingdom in the 1990s , complaining of persecution by the royal administration .
they found refuge in the camps in eastern nepal , run by the unhcr .
several rounds of talks between nepal and bhutan have failed to resolve the issue .
but as bhutan heads for its first national elections next year , the refugee leaders are pressing for the return of their people to the kingdom so that they can vote and regain their citizenship .

he denies charges including the murder , torture and persecution of croats , muslims and other non-serbs in the 1990s .
on the trial " i already have this winning feeling inside me . " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- " do not give -lsb- them -rsb- any serb after me , do n't give them radovan karadzic , do n't give them ratko mladic .

" -lrb- 2003 -rrb- " with their stupid charges against me they have come up against the greatest living legal serb mind .
i shall blast them to pieces . " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- " i am going to spite them , to tell them that the serbian people will never give up the liberation of serb dubrovnik , serb dalmatia , serb lika , serb banija , serb kordun , serb slavonija , serb baranja , serb bosnia , serb hercegovina , serb kosovo and serb metohija . " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- " they do not have evidence that i participated , incited , concealed or urged war crimes . "
-lrb- february 2003 -rrb- " you falsely presented this man with a bird 's nest on the top of his head as my defence lawyer .
he will never be my defence lawyer .
you brought actors here to act as my defence lawyers but they will never be my defence lawyers .
they are your spies . "
-lrb- september 2006 -rrb- " be kind enough and give an order to -lsb- the court security guards -rsb- to take me out . "
-lrb- september 2006 -rrb- " i can not stand either -lsb- defence lawyer david -rsb- hooper or -lsb- defence lawyer andreas -rsb- o 'shea .
my defence is impossible for as long as they are in the courtroom . "
-lrb- november 2006 -rrb- " i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech as i preached my nationalist ideology that i am proud of . "
-lrb- november 2007 -rrb- " i have no other involvement in these crimes expect for what i said or wrote . "
-lrb- november 2007 -rrb- on kosovo " the only albanians who should live here are the ones who think of serbia as their fatherland . "
-lrb- may 1999 -rrb- on croatia and bosnia " the serbian traitor slobodan milosevic is seeking the destruction of the political and military leadership of the republic of serbian krajina and the republic of srpska . "
-lrb- august 1995 -rrb- " between hitler and clinton , there is no principal difference " vojislav seselj " he slipped on a banana skin , several times . "
-lrb- on a lawyer defending croats who was beaten up by his bodyguards after a tv debate , september 1997 -rrb- " we shall realize the boundaries of greater serbia when we assume power at the federal level .
as serbia is now , as a federal unit , it does not have the competence to initiate this .
but as a political party , we shall never give up this goal . "
-lrb- october 1997 -rrb- " we 're not fascists .
we 're just chauvinists who hate croats . "
-lrb- october 1997 -rrb- on the nato bombing campaign against serbia " the western powers have no proof against serbia and they are just trying to find an excuse , a horrifying image that will mobilize opinion and justify the bombardment of our country . "
-lrb- october 1998 -rrb- " we might not be able to shoot down each one of their planes , but their soldiers will be our enemies everywhere in the world and they will be exposed to our attacks wherever they are within our range . "
-lrb- october 1998 -rrb- " each -lrb- nato -rrb- soldier is an enemy of the serb people and should be destroyed . "
-lrb- march 1999 -rrb- " between hitler and clinton , there is no principal difference . "
-lrb- april 1999 -rrb- " i do not speak english . "
-lrb- shouting at a us journalist who addressed him in english at a news conference , may 1999 -rrb- to the independent media " the gloves are off .

rocket designer long lehao told state media scientists were on track to send " a small-scale 20-ton space workshop " into the earth 's orbit .
space officials later said the plan had not been finalised .
the claim follows the launch of china 's first moon probe last month , amid what some analysts are calling an undeclared space race with japan and india .
since russia 's mir station was decommissioned in 2001 , the only such facility in operation is the international space station - a joint project of 16 nations .
mr long 's comments were carried widely in chinese media , but a space official later suggested the plans were not so definite .
" china at present has not decided on developing a space station , " said li guoping , of the china national space administration .
rocket breakthrough mr long told the china daily newspaper that the station was the third and final step in china 's manned space programme .
the first stage was a manned flight in 2003 and the second would come in 2008 , when astronauts are expected to walk in space .
" it is the first time a timetable has been made public for the building of the first space station , " the china daily quoted mr long as saying .
mr long said he was optimistic about the launch of the space station because of breakthroughs in chinese rocket technology .
the new long march v carrier rockets , which can carry heavier loads , are expected to be ready for testing in 2013 , he said .
the bbc 's dan griffiths , in beijing , says china 's rapid move into space is aimed at boosting national pride and international prestige .
but earlier this year , beijing triggered international concern by using a ground-based missile to destroy a weather satellite as part of a weapons test .
other countries in the region are also expanding and accelerating their space programmes .
japan launched a lunar orbiter last month and india is planning to follow suit in april next year .
such moves are fuelling claims of an undeclared asian space race .

iphone killers ?
lg lgks20 nokia n95 sony ericsson w960 htc touch palm centro blackberry pearl samsung blackjack t-mobile sidekick slide mr arber said the iphone 's touch screen was the application that most competitors would be seeking to emulate .
" it 's only just being explored to its fullest .
the iphone right now does it fairly well .
it 's going to be the touch screen experience competitors will be looking to beat . "
but it is not just the hardware that apple 's competitors are seeking to beat - it is the services also .
apple 's itunes music store and its integration with the iphone is seductive for many people .
to counter that nokia and operator vodafone have launched separate services which they believe are iphone killers .
al russell , vodafone 's head of internet and content services , said the iphone was a " significant development in our marketplace " .
but he said vodafone 's musicstation , which is a subscription-based music service , offered functionality that the iphone could not match .
" this generation does not want an archive of music .
we offer unlimited music on a rental model - no-one has done this in the marketplace , and certainly not the iphone .
" we know our customer base have tremendous appetite for new music and sharing . "
nokia 's uk managing director simon ainslie said the model of the ipod and itunes had been very successful but they had relatively little penetration outside the us and uk .

the iphone goes on sale at more than a 1,000 o2 stores , carphone warehouse outlets and apple 's own shops on friday at precisely 18.02gmt.

by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website apple 's iphone may have only been on release for a few months but it is making waves in the global mobile industry .
so how are competitors responding ?
more than 285 million handsets from a plethora of manufacturers were sold globally between july and september this year , according to recent figures from research firm strategy analytics .
the figures are up 12 % on last year , and each and every week new handsets and services are launched into a burgeoning market ever hungry for more features .
apple is the new kid on the block and managed to sell 1.4m iphones in the first 90 days on sale .
the device goes on sale in the uk and germany on friday .
it is an impressive number but a fraction of the global market .
and the companies who dominate the global market are putting out handsets that are serious competitors .
eight phones can be considered rivals for the customers apple is targeting .
geek test n95 versus iphone the rivals are : nokia n95 sony ericsson w960 lg lgks20 htc touch palm centro blackberry pearl samsung blackjack t-mobile sidekick slide it is clear that nokia , lg , samsung , sony ericsson , htc and motorola , are keeping their eyes firmly on apple 's progress .
" there 's no sign of panic from competitors , " said jonathan arber , a principal analyst at ovum .
" there 's no scrambling .
but anyone who is trying to take market share concerns them . "
grand surroundings last week samsung unveiled a camera phone in the grand surroundings of the british museum , in london .
amid the antiquities , journalists from 35 countries around the world were flown into london and put up in five-star hotels at samsung 's expense to get a first look at the new handset .
the g800 would not appear to be a direct competitor to the iphone but in a question and answer session with executives apple 's device was brought up several times .
" what is samsung doing to match the user interface of the iphone ? " asked one reporter .
we think it provides everything the iphone does but also gps navigation as well .
nokia 's simon ainslie on the n95 " we 're actively working on new user interfaces and you can expect to see something special in 2008 , " said one of the key execs .
other firms have also been quick to roll out devices which they say offer all of the features of the iphone yet " cheaper , simpler , faster , better " .
but apple , for now at least , is only targeting a small sector of the mobile market .
by comparison nokia hit the 40 % magic target of market share globally , said mr arber .

the show has been shortlisted in five categories , among them best tv comedy and best new british tv comedy .
cast member ruth jones , meanwhile , is up for best tv comedy actress and best female comedy newcomer .
this year 's awards , hosted by jonathan ross , will take place on 5 december - despite continuing uncertainty whether it will be aired on itv1 as usual .
alleged irregularities with a public phone vote in 2005 led itv to suspend its coverage of the annual event .
jones - whose work in bbc two 's saxondale has also been recognised - faces competition from catherine tate in the comedy actress category .
double act tv veteran liz smith has also been nominated for her role in royle family special the queen of sheba .
stand-up jack dee is up for the best tv comedy actor prize for his role in bbc four sitcom lead balloon .
other candidates include channel 4 's friday night project double act alan carr and justin lee collins - nominated together for the best comedy entertainment personality prize - and qi host stephen fry .
but there are no nominations for ant and dec , whose victory in 2005 's people 's choice award prompted an internal investigation .
itv hired law firm olswang to probe allegations that viewers had been encouraged to vote in the category in a section of the programme broadcast with a half-hour time delay .
in reality , the winner of the award - ant and dec 's saturday night takeaway - had already been announced .
itv has said it would not comment on the matter until the investigation was concluded .

this battle is far from over , with new efforts now under way to convert much of africa 's land into vast monocultures to produce either food or biofuels for export .
and because it 's just " seeds " we 're talking about here , or nondescript plants for agriculture , the world just stands aside as if this continuing " war on nature " was of little importance .

the majority of the world 's food comes from just 20 crops causes once " in fashion " suddenly become invisible ; other causes suddenly become all the rage .
today , it 's all climate change ; if it is n't climate change - from a media point-of-view - just do n't bother .
two weeks ago , for instance , the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- published its global environmental outlook - a quite devastating audit of the state of the earth , its habitats , species and resources .
a quarter of the world 's flowering plants , for instance , are now threatened with extinction over the next 50 years .
there was some reasonable coverage on the day itself -lrb- especially in the independent -rrb- , but then silence .
environment going to hell in a handcart - heard it all before ; so what ?
or words to that effect .
save our seeds the number of people out there today seriously worried about the health of all the plants and seeds on which modern agriculture depends must be very limited , and the number of people actively campaigning to protect them vanishingly few .
making these two radio 4 programmes called save our seeds forcefully reminded me just how crazy that is .
of the earth 's 250,000 plant species , only 200 are cultivated for food on any serious scale .
even more extraordinary , the vast majority of the world 's food comes from just 20 crops , in just eight plant families .
most of these monocultures are dangerously vulnerable to diseases -lrb- both old and new -rrb- , pest infestations , and a rapidly changing climate .
yet the " genetic pool " on which plant breeders might need to draw to build resistance and adaptability is being constantly eroded as older , non-commercial varieties disappear .
drawing of the " doomsday " vault to be opened in 2008 there are two ways of protecting the diversity of plants and seeds .
the first is through seed banks .
i visited the hugely impressive millennium seed bank , set up by kew gardens , which is well on its way to collecting , sorting and storing the seeds of up to 10 % of the world 's flora .
this is just one of 1,400 seed banks across the world , some of them surviving in almost impossibly tough conditions , others well-funded with strong government support .
we interviewed some of the real heroes in the world of seed banks , including the redoubtable cary fowler , director of the global crop diversity trust , who is spearheading an astonishing project to build a state-of-the-art storage facility for the world at svalbard , way up in the north of norway .
but seed banks can only do so much in this massive salvage operation .
the seeds they store need to regularly germinate , otherwise they too die .
the best way of maintaining an active and vibrant seed bank is to ensure that farmers -lrb- and gardeners -rrb- are planting out those " land races " and rare varieties of plants which are now so endangered .
more often than not , that sets small-scale , subsistence farmers -lrb- on whom this kind of " active conservation " depends -rrb- in conflict with the juggernaut of industrialised , intensive agriculture .
this battle is far from over , with new efforts now under way to convert much of africa 's land into vast monocultures to produce either food or biofuels for export .
and because it 's just " seeds " we 're talking about here , or nondescript plants for agriculture , the world just stands aside as if this continuing " war on nature " was of little importance .
one suspects that there are some harsh lessons soon to be learned .

alcohol concern said the price of alcohol had barely risen in 10 years but children 's weekly allowances had increased 600 % since 1987 .
it called for increased taxes on alcohol to deter young drinkers .
but drinks industry body the portman group said education was a better way to prevent under-18s abusing alcohol .
alcohol concern said it had collected price information from random branches of supermarkets that had previously failed the home office 's spot-checks for selling alcohol to under-18s .
a teenager could easily buy three times the daily recommended alcohol limit for an adult male , it said .

spending £ 7.98 could get them eight bottles of smirnoff ice from sainsbury 's - 9.9 units or 3.3 times a woman 's daily limit .

alcohol concern 's director of policy and services don shenker said : " young people quite often drink to get drunk .
" when they manage to purchase alcohol , the aim is generally to drink it over the course of one evening .
" cheap alcohol promotions help explain just why those young people who drink can afford to do so at far greater levels than in the past . "
the charity said it was legally impossible under eu competition rules to have a minimum price on public health grounds , but that increased taxation was allowed .
youth appeal it argued increased taxation could be targeted at products that were particularly appealing to young people .
mr shenker added : " until government gets serious about making alcohol less affordable , it 's hard to see how we can prevent young people from cheap alcohol and risky drinking . "

it is increasingly difficult for young people to buy alcohol themselves " jeremy beadles wine and spirit trade association he added : " it seems peculiar to be considering taxing adult drinkers to stop children breaking the law .
" there is a serious problem with underage drinking in the uk , but it is important to acknowledge some positive trends .
" there are now more child abstainers than ever before , and even the numbers of 16-to-24-year-olds binge drinking has been falling since 2003 . "

the admission will be seen as a victory for thalidomide campaigners who want their condition to be recognised .
until now the health ministry has refused to confirm that the drug was sold , which has led to confusion .
a one line email was sent to the bbc which simply says : " thalidomide was sold in spain between 1957 and 1961 . "
the president of avite - the spanish thalidomide association - pepe riquelme said " it 's very , very important for us that they have finally admitted this .
" it 's a big step .
it confirms what we knew - that we have been fighting for the right thing for all these years .
" it opens up a new path for us .
it 's going to be a long struggle , but we will win in the end . "
thalidomide - sold as a remedy for morning sickness and as a sedative - caused thousands of babies to be born with disabilities around the world .
it was originally developed and manufactured by a german company , chemie grunenthal , and was withdrawn from sale after the link between its use and birth defects was established in 1961 .
in most countries where it was sold compensation was paid to thalidomide survivors either by pharmaceutical companies , governments or a combination of both .
but in spain - which was under a fascist dictatorship at the time - no admission about the use of the drug was made and those affected were given little or no information .
those who believe that their disabilities were caused by the drug formed avite in 2003 and have been campaigning for compensation and recognition from the spanish government and from chemie grunenthal .
pepe riquelme founded avite to get recognition for thalidomiders in spain because of the lack of clarity over whether and how much thalidomide was sold in spain it is difficult to determine how many people were affected .
avite has around 150 members with disabilities typical of the damage caused by the drug .
mr riquelme says that he is disillusioned with politicians who , in the past , have promised to help the thalidomiders but who have yet to make good their promises .
the spanish government has set up a process to find out how many people were disabled as a result of thalidomide but - according to avite - even those who can prove that their mothers took the medication have only been told they are " probably " thalidomiders .
and the association says that the body responsible for determining thalidomide damage has refused offers of help from doctors in the uk who are acknowledged experts in the field .
the clarification from the government - although a welcome first step for the campaigners - still leaves matters somewhat confused .
according to chemie grunenthal , thalidomide was only sold in spain between 1960 and 1961 .
although he welcomed the announcement , mr riquelme said : " we feel sad because we have been told that the process of establishing who has been affected by thalidomide was completed in march , but we have not heard anything from the government .
we have no idea what they are going to do .
it is already november and many victims still have not received the results of their tests .

the admission will be seen as a victory for thalidomide campaigners who want their condition to be recognised .
until now the health ministry has refused to confirm that the drug was sold , which has led to confusion .
a one line email was sent to the bbc which simply says : " thalidomide was sold in spain between 1957 and 1961 . "
the president of avite - the spanish thalidomide association - pepe riquelme said " it 's very , very important for us that they have finally admitted this .
" it 's a big step .
it confirms what we knew - that we have been fighting for the right thing for all these years .
" it opens up a new path for us .
it 's going to be a long struggle , but we will win in the end . "
thalidomide - sold as a remedy for morning sickness and as a sedative - caused thousands of babies to be born with disabilities around the world .
it was originally developed and manufactured by a german company , chemie grunenthal , and was withdrawn from sale after the link between its use and birth defects was established in 1961 .
in most countries where it was sold compensation was paid to thalidomide survivors either by pharmaceutical companies , governments or a combination of both .
but in spain - which was under a fascist dictatorship at the time - no admission about the use of the drug was made and those affected were given little or no information .
those who believe that their disabilities were caused by the drug formed avite in 2003 and have been campaigning for compensation and recognition from the spanish government and from chemie grunenthal .
pepe riquelme founded avite to get recognition for thalidomiders in spain because of the lack of clarity over whether and how much thalidomide was sold in spain it is difficult to determine how many people were affected .
avite has around 150 members with disabilities typical of the damage caused by the drug .
mr riquelme says that he is disillusioned with politicians who , in the past , have promised to help the thalidomiders but who have yet to make good their promises .
the spanish government has set up a process to find out how many people were disabled as a result of thalidomide but - according to avite - even those who can prove that their mothers took the medication have only been told they are " probably " thalidomiders .
and the association says that the body responsible for determining thalidomide damage has refused offers of help from doctors in the uk who are acknowledged experts in the field .

the nda is to spend £ 8.5bn over the next three years - an increase of £ 671m on the previous three-year period .

" it is increasingly clear that due to operational difficulties at sellafield , the timescales for defuelling the magnox stations will need to be re-assessed and we will need to work through the implications of this with our stakeholders . "

the authority says ongoing " operational difficulties " mean it will take longer than expected to make safe old-style magnox facilities at the site .
the nda is to spend £ 8.5bn over the next three years - an increase of £ 671m on the previous three-year period .
most of the cash will go on work at sellafield and dounreay in scotland .
the figures are revealed in the nda 's draft three-year plan .
chief executive dr ian roxburgh said : " in line with our strategy , our priority is hazard reduction and we will be focused on the sites that require the most work .
' high-level hazards ' " this means that the majority of funds over the next three years will be focused on sellafield and dounreay , whilst safety remains the absolute priority across all our sites .
" it is increasingly clear that due to operational difficulties at sellafield , the timescales for defuelling the magnox stations will need to be re-assessed and we will need to work through the implications of this with our stakeholders . "
barry snelson , managing director at sellafield , said : " we have received a higher level of funding than in previous years , and this will allow us to maintain our focus on reducing the high-level hazards on our sites .
" while this will mean a reduction in the rate of growth at sellafield , it clearly affirms our strategy of putting cleanup of the highest hazards as our first priority .
" we will need to increase the timescales associated with our clean-up plan but , on the plus side this should help deliver a longer , more stable work schedule rather than peaks and troughs . "
