or in bastian schweinsteiger 's case , the sausage . fetishists flocking to augsburg for the chance to get their hands on a young soccer player lathered in mustard and onions were disappointed to discover this week that the offer of a piping hot " schweini " did not mean the chance to indulge in a bit of food play with a millionaire soccer star . however , they could not have been more disappointed and miffed than the meat wholesaler who found himself in court for breaching the individual rights of the bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , the man saddled with the nickname at the heart of the case . when the 22-year-old germany international found out that the butcher from aichach-friedberg was selling bratwurst under the " schweini " name , the bayern star took offense and went in search of redress with the help of his club 's powerful legal team and his own representation . butcher hauled over the barbeque coals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " schweini " lines up with its colleagues the poor fleischer did n't stand a chance despite his protestations that he had used the " schweini " moniker purely out of its literal meaning in german - " piggy " .
as the sausages he was selling under the name were made of pork , he thought he had a good case .
he was wrong . during the 2005 confederations cup in germany , schweinsteiger and his bayern teammate lukas podolski took the surprisingly intelligent step of protecting their nicknames - " schweini " and " poldi " - by registering them as brand names . the district court in munich which heard the case ruled against the sausage after due deliberation and the butcher was convicted of infringing the rights of the claimant .
he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .
no final decision on the costs had been made at the time of publication . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blame it on the bratwurst it 's official .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

or in bastian schweinsteiger 's case , the sausage . fetishists flocking to augsburg for the chance to get their hands on a young soccer player lathered in mustard and onions were disappointed to discover this week that the offer of a piping hot " schweini " did not mean the chance to indulge in a bit of food play with a millionaire soccer star . however , they could not have been more disappointed and miffed than the meat wholesaler who found himself in court for breaching the individual rights of the bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , the man saddled with the nickname at the heart of the case . when the 22-year-old germany international found out that the butcher from aichach-friedberg was selling bratwurst under the " schweini " name , the bayern star took offense and went in search of redress with the help of his club 's powerful legal team and his own representation . butcher hauled over the barbeque coals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " schweini " lines up with its colleagues the poor fleischer did n't stand a chance despite his protestations that he had used the " schweini " moniker purely out of its literal meaning in german - " piggy " .
as the sausages he was selling under the name were made of pork , he thought he had a good case .
he was wrong . during the 2005 confederations cup in germany , schweinsteiger and his bayern teammate lukas podolski took the surprisingly intelligent step of protecting their nicknames - " schweini " and " poldi " - by registering them as brand names . the district court in munich which heard the case ruled against the sausage after due deliberation and the butcher was convicted of infringing the rights of the claimant .
he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .
no final decision on the costs had been made at the time of publication . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blame it on the bratwurst it 's official .

similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .

opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2007 in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed plot to bomb trains in germany last year speeded up the creation of the database germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .
but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2007 germany welcomes new un convention on rights for disabled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said policymakers do not always consider the needs of people with disabilities un officials said they hope a new treaty will improve living and working conditions for the world 's 650 million disabled , while politicians in berlin want to integrate more physically disabled into mainstream schools . united nations high commissioner for human rights louise arbour said she hoped a new convention , which will be open for signatures on friday , would be a catalyst for change since the disabled in many countries often suffer from marginalization and discrimination because policymakers seldom consider their needs . " there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 30.03.2007 danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish linguists fear new additions to the language will only be in english danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany . " if we can speak german to the germans , we can have an advantage over , say , american business which tries to approach this market in english , " he said . but in denmark , increased business opportunities do little to ease the fears of some about the shaky outlook for the language of kierkegaard .
english-language publishers are already doing a booming trade in denmark , where one in six books sold are in english . " language is a very essential part of your identity .
your history , literature and your culture is affected by the language you use , " said ib tune olsen , head of the danish publishers association .
he becomes pensive when asked if danish will be spoken in 100 years . " a good question , " he said .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2007 " internal corruption remains a problem in the european union " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buitenen 's investigations in 1999 led to the commission 's fall - and his own castigation dutch mep and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate paul van buitenen was the whistleblower who brought down the eu commission in 1999 .
he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .
something is not right here . dennis stute interviewed paul van buitenen , representative of the europe transparent anti-corruption party in the european parliament . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italians charged in eu fraud scandal three italian nationals have been charged and are being held in custody in brussels as part of a corruption probe into tenders awarded by the european commission .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .

there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .

i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2007 in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed plot to bomb trains in germany last year speeded up the creation of the database germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .
but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

or in bastian schweinsteiger 's case , the sausage . fetishists flocking to augsburg for the chance to get their hands on a young soccer player lathered in mustard and onions were disappointed to discover this week that the offer of a piping hot " schweini " did not mean the chance to indulge in a bit of food play with a millionaire soccer star . however , they could not have been more disappointed and miffed than the meat wholesaler who found himself in court for breaching the individual rights of the bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , the man saddled with the nickname at the heart of the case . when the 22-year-old germany international found out that the butcher from aichach-friedberg was selling bratwurst under the " schweini " name , the bayern star took offense and went in search of redress with the help of his club 's powerful legal team and his own representation . butcher hauled over the barbeque coals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " schweini " lines up with its colleagues the poor fleischer did n't stand a chance despite his protestations that he had used the " schweini " moniker purely out of its literal meaning in german - " piggy " .
as the sausages he was selling under the name were made of pork , he thought he had a good case .
he was wrong . during the 2005 confederations cup in germany , schweinsteiger and his bayern teammate lukas podolski took the surprisingly intelligent step of protecting their nicknames - " schweini " and " poldi " - by registering them as brand names . the district court in munich which heard the case ruled against the sausage after due deliberation and the butcher was convicted of infringing the rights of the claimant .
he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .
no final decision on the costs had been made at the time of publication . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blame it on the bratwurst it 's official .
a new study has found that the tubbiest germans are those in the eastern state of thuringia , coincidentally also home to one of the country 's most popular sausage varieties .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .

opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties .

the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog .

" we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2007 " internal corruption remains a problem in the european union " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buitenen 's investigations in 1999 led to the commission 's fall - and his own castigation dutch mep and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate paul van buitenen was the whistleblower who brought down the eu commission in 1999 .
he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2007 danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish linguists fear new additions to the language will only be in english danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany . " if we can speak german to the germans , we can have an advantage over , say , american business which tries to approach this market in english , " he said . but in denmark , increased business opportunities do little to ease the fears of some about the shaky outlook for the language of kierkegaard .
english-language publishers are already doing a booming trade in denmark , where one in six books sold are in english . " language is a very essential part of your identity .
your history , literature and your culture is affected by the language you use , " said ib tune olsen , head of the danish publishers association .
he becomes pensive when asked if danish will be spoken in 100 years . " a good question , " he said .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention . " germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2007 " internal corruption remains a problem in the european union " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buitenen 's investigations in 1999 led to the commission 's fall - and his own castigation dutch mep and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate paul van buitenen was the whistleblower who brought down the eu commission in 1999 .
he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

or in bastian schweinsteiger 's case , the sausage . fetishists flocking to augsburg for the chance to get their hands on a young soccer player lathered in mustard and onions were disappointed to discover this week that the offer of a piping hot " schweini " did not mean the chance to indulge in a bit of food play with a millionaire soccer star . however , they could not have been more disappointed and miffed than the meat wholesaler who found himself in court for breaching the individual rights of the bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , the man saddled with the nickname at the heart of the case . when the 22-year-old germany international found out that the butcher from aichach-friedberg was selling bratwurst under the " schweini " name , the bayern star took offense and went in search of redress with the help of his club 's powerful legal team and his own representation . butcher hauled over the barbeque coals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " schweini " lines up with its colleagues the poor fleischer did n't stand a chance despite his protestations that he had used the " schweini " moniker purely out of its literal meaning in german - " piggy " .
as the sausages he was selling under the name were made of pork , he thought he had a good case .
he was wrong . during the 2005 confederations cup in germany , schweinsteiger and his bayern teammate lukas podolski took the surprisingly intelligent step of protecting their nicknames - " schweini " and " poldi " - by registering them as brand names . the district court in munich which heard the case ruled against the sausage after due deliberation and the butcher was convicted of infringing the rights of the claimant .
he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .

it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2007 danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish linguists fear new additions to the language will only be in english danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany .

" germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
-lrb- 12.03.2007 -rrb- german parliament backs reconnaissance mission to afghanistan germany 's parliament approved on friday a plan to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by insurgents .

" it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2007 opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog .

" we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2007 " internal corruption remains a problem in the european union " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buitenen 's investigations in 1999 led to the commission 's fall - and his own castigation dutch mep and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate paul van buitenen was the whistleblower who brought down the eu commission in 1999 .
he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .
something is not right here . dennis stute interviewed paul van buitenen , representative of the europe transparent anti-corruption party in the european parliament . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italians charged in eu fraud scandal three italian nationals have been charged and are being held in custody in brussels as part of a corruption probe into tenders awarded by the european commission .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .
something is not right here . dennis stute interviewed paul van buitenen , representative of the europe transparent anti-corruption party in the european parliament . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italians charged in eu fraud scandal three italian nationals have been charged and are being held in custody in brussels as part of a corruption probe into tenders awarded by the european commission .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .

the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.03.2007 opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 .

it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .

" we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany . " if we can speak german to the germans , we can have an advantage over , say , american business which tries to approach this market in english , " he said . but in denmark , increased business opportunities do little to ease the fears of some about the shaky outlook for the language of kierkegaard .
english-language publishers are already doing a booming trade in denmark , where one in six books sold are in english . " language is a very essential part of your identity .
your history , literature and your culture is affected by the language you use , " said ib tune olsen , head of the danish publishers association .
he becomes pensive when asked if danish will be spoken in 100 years . " a good question , " he said .

similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog .

" we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .

" the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now .

" after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention . " germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release .

it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog .

or in bastian schweinsteiger 's case , the sausage . fetishists flocking to augsburg for the chance to get their hands on a young soccer player lathered in mustard and onions were disappointed to discover this week that the offer of a piping hot " schweini " did not mean the chance to indulge in a bit of food play with a millionaire soccer star . however , they could not have been more disappointed and miffed than the meat wholesaler who found himself in court for breaching the individual rights of the bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , the man saddled with the nickname at the heart of the case . when the 22-year-old germany international found out that the butcher from aichach-friedberg was selling bratwurst under the " schweini " name , the bayern star took offense and went in search of redress with the help of his club 's powerful legal team and his own representation . butcher hauled over the barbeque coals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " schweini " lines up with its colleagues the poor fleischer did n't stand a chance despite his protestations that he had used the " schweini " moniker purely out of its literal meaning in german - " piggy " .
as the sausages he was selling under the name were made of pork , he thought he had a good case .
he was wrong . during the 2005 confederations cup in germany , schweinsteiger and his bayern teammate lukas podolski took the surprisingly intelligent step of protecting their nicknames - " schweini " and " poldi " - by registering them as brand names . the district court in munich which heard the case ruled against the sausage after due deliberation and the butcher was convicted of infringing the rights of the claimant .
he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention . " germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .

he was ordered to provide details of the profits made on his " schweini " sales , so that an evaluation of damages to be paid to the soccer player could be made . an initial figure of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 -rrb- in damages was suggested by schweinsteiger 's legal team .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention . " germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2007 danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish linguists fear new additions to the language will only be in english danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany . " if we can speak german to the germans , we can have an advantage over , say , american business which tries to approach this market in english , " he said . but in denmark , increased business opportunities do little to ease the fears of some about the shaky outlook for the language of kierkegaard .
english-language publishers are already doing a booming trade in denmark , where one in six books sold are in english . " language is a very essential part of your identity .
your history , literature and your culture is affected by the language you use , " said ib tune olsen , head of the danish publishers association .
he becomes pensive when asked if danish will be spoken in 100 years . " a good question , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.03.2007 in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed plot to bomb trains in germany last year speeded up the creation of the database germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .
but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .
the syrian was later released , but the lebanese , youssef el-hajib , remains in custody on charges of attempted multiple murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble underlined the importance of the database a german court friday extended el-hajib 's pre-trial detention but dropped charges accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization . " germany continues to take very seriously the threat posed by islamic extremists , " schäuble said on friday .
the databank " is an effective and measured instrument " to counter the danger , the minister said . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the fight against terrorism is " always a race against time " and added that " tools like the anti-terror database can help us secure a decisive lead . " critics say measure too tough establishment of the database follows significant political haggling .
german opposition parties have protested that it might violate the constitution , as well as the deeply entrenched separation of powers that the allies imposed on germany after world war ii . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , in light of abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . when the law setting up the databank was approved by parliament in december , opposition deputies charged it would turn germany into a police state . a compromise reached last year has resulted in the database , which holds information compiled by germany 's 38 security agencies , divided into two levels .
the first will be accessible to all of the agencies and hold the names , aliases and addresses of suspects as well as information about their appearance , such as birthmarks .
the second will be used to store information about suspects ' families , contacts , bank accounts and religious practices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were in part plotted in hamburg by law , security officials will only be able to consult the second tier after obtaining the permission of the agency which collected the data about the suspect in question . however , an exception can be made in cases where the authorities believe there is the threat of an imminent terrorist attack .
opponents have also criticized this clause , saying that in the fight against terrorism , the authorities could almost always plead urgency , and that the exception therefore risked becoming the rule . germany has amended its laws to be better able to fight terrorism since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were in part plotted on german soil . critics worried about data protection on friday , critics renewed their opposition to the common database , citing privacy concerns and saying the database could erode civil liberties . " this will result in too much information about too many individuals , compiled from too many sources , becoming available to too many people , " said green party member wolfgang wieland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's top data protection official has misgivings about the database peter schaar , germany 's data protection commissioner , criticized the fact that security officials could possibly get access to the data of friends and other contact persons of a terror suspect . " for example , if you happen to live in a students ' dormitory where a suspect stays , then that can suffice for the authorities to take a look at your personal data , " schaar said . others have raised fears that the anti-terror database could end up being burdened with too much unnecessary information and increase work for security officials , thus weakening the fight against terrorism . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .
since there would be no danish words for these developments , the english expressions would be , by necessity , adopted by the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will danish be spoken throughout his lifetime ?
it has already begun , kirchmeier-andersen said , in several areas , and one only has to flip through a newspaper to see concrete examples .
advertisements and want ads often feature english words and expressions , not unusual today in europe .
but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on . " bill under consideration the danish government has begun to take notice and is now debating a bill put forward by the danish people 's party , a controversial right-wing populist party , which would secure danish 's position as the language of denmark .
it would ensure that all correspondence , public speeches and meetings are held only in danish .
it would also regulate signage on public buildings , even down to the font size used in danish or english words . " it 's a very defensive position , which we have a problem with , " said mogens jansen , a spokesman for culture and media for the danish social democrats .
but his group has joined the discussion around creating a formal language policy , something not considered necessary in the past . " we need to secure the danish language but also improve danes ' foreign language skills , since the reality is that we do live in a globalized world , " he said . polyglot solution ? that strategy makes sense to johan van hoorde , general secretary of the european federation of national institutes of language and a senior project manager at the dutch language union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academie francaise defends the french language against ugly incursions with a passion - but perhaps not much success his country , also the home of a " smaller " european language , shares some of denmark 's concerns , and also thinks a strategy of increased multilingualism is the answer , instead of conducting a vain battle against english .
he points to the french , who have been more " alarmist " in their objections to english , having passed the toubon law in 1994 mandating the use of french in government publications , advertising and some other areas .
it is considered overly strict and reactionary by some . according to him , if the dutch and scandinavians were to focus on their seemingly inborn polyglot talents , it could bring benefits even on the economic front , especially when it comes to the countries ' biggest trading partner , germany . " if we can speak german to the germans , we can have an advantage over , say , american business which tries to approach this market in english , " he said . but in denmark , increased business opportunities do little to ease the fears of some about the shaky outlook for the language of kierkegaard .
english-language publishers are already doing a booming trade in denmark , where one in six books sold are in english . " language is a very essential part of your identity .
your history , literature and your culture is affected by the language you use , " said ib tune olsen , head of the danish publishers association .
he becomes pensive when asked if danish will be spoken in 100 years . " a good question , " he said .

because the tornados will be relaying coordinates for potential bombing targets , deputies are worried that germany could become a party to attacks that result in civilian deaths . the left party claims parliament acted inappropriately in authorizing the deployment , arguing that it was the result of a creeping transformation of nato from a defense alliance into " an offensive alliance for global intervention . " germany currently has around 3,000 troops stationed with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . most of them are confined to the relatively peaceful north where they form part of provincial reconstruction teams building up infrastructure , schools and other institutions . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany " wo n't be blackmailed , " minister says german politicians have rejected calls for the bundeswehr to pull out of afghanistan under threat of terror attacks as a foreign ministry crisis team works to free two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2007 opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .
officials in berlin have proposed handing out fines to parents whose children misbehave .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .
but if people like me sound the alarm , we are suspended and sometimes have our salary halved .

he talked to dw-world.de about current corruption in the eu . paul van buitenen , a dutch mep in the european parliament and former assistant auditor of the financial control directorate , believes that the fight against corruption in europe has made little progress since new initiatives were set up in the wake of the eu 's biggest scandal which brought down the commission in 1999 . dw-world : is there structural corruption in the eu ? paul van buitenen : the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- has had success in combating external corruption in the member states , but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems .
working with the eu authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation .
officially , olaf is an independent body , but it functions within the eu commission ; in the commission building , on the commission 's computer network and works with commission investigators .
olaf 's independence exists only on paper . which of the eu organizations are especially susceptible to corruption ? olaf has investigated the european commission for regional policy and has confirmed through investigation that corruption has taken place there over a number of years .
the commission works with local and municipal bodies in the member states and encourages them engage with brussels .
however , no important decisions are made on the recommendation of the committee so once could basically abolish the organization completely and save the eu some 70 million euros -lrb- $ 93.4 million -rrb- .
plus , some members have been shown to have unexplained extra salaries and olaf has discovered a number of discrepancies in reports .
every time the committee is approached about corruption , it promises to improve the situation .
but then a new case arises . how is the situation in the eu parliament ? there is corruption , but these are special cases .
there are always conflicts of interests everywhere .
if someone sits on the supervisory board of a big automobile company , that person should not write in the european parliament guidelines on subjects like fuel or manufacture .
but i do not go around the building with a camera to see what my colleagues do .
i concentrate on the big deception cases and irregularities with european implications . which new measures would be necessary to fight against corruption ? in some states , like germany or holland , controlling possibilities already exist ; there are independent judicial authorities and a strong parliament .
at a european level , however , there is not a democracy , but a bureaucracy .
we must decide if we are to continue with the european arrangement .
if we do , then we must also create these democratic structures at european level .
otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again .
but at the moment , as it stands , everything goes wrong . when you uncovered the eu commission scandal in 1999 which brought down the commission , you were punished .
has the situation changed ? i would say : things have got even worse .
there is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals .
but in reality , if one does this , they are destroyed .
so the regulation does not work .
if a committee official , like in the 1999 case , is suspected of corruption , he is moved to another department at the beginning of the inquiries so he can no longer carry out those activities - but he continues to be employed and still gets his salary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.03.2007 opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says many questions still remain unanswered . frank-walter steinmeier need not worry anymore about whether the affair of guantanamo bay inmate , murat kurnaz , could have political consequences for him .
testifying before a special parliamentary committee , the german foreign minister managed to credibly explain the difficult and complex situation he found himself in when it came to deciding the fate of the german-born turk but also when it came to protecting the security of the german population . the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the us were just a year old and the united nations and nato , with the help of the germany , prepared to overthrow the taliban regime in afghanistan .
in such an atmosphere , germany was a potential target for hate-filled terrorists .
it 's a danger that still exists if you consider the german nationals held hostage in iraq and the recent circulation of threatening videos on the internet . fending off danger was and is the duty of responsible politicians such as steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and thus responsible for coordinating intelligence .
with its vehement opposition to the iraq war , schröder 's government stood for the moral authority of the west in the eyes of many .
that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .

that 's why there was understandably deep outrage when it became evident that the same government could have helped the americans cart off innocents to the guantanamo bay prison camp which violates international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier stands accused of doing exactly that in the case of kurnaz , because the minister in his previous role is said to have prevented a possible return of the former inmate .
steinmeier ca n't be blamed for relying on the judgment of the intelligence agency chief .
but he must ask himself in a self-critical way why he waited so long to give his version of events . in his own interest and in the interest of german foreign policy , steinmeier should have done that as soon as the first allegations appeared in the media .
his long silence as well as that of other politicians inevitably had to lead to speculation and conspiracy theories that steinmeier , his predecessor joschka fischer and the former interior minister , otto schily , had skeletons in the closet . their hesitation made it easier for the opposition to attack .
and it should not be forgotten that at least some of the demands and criticism are justified .
for instance , the often exaggerated withholding of files whose often unspectacular content is long known thanks to publication in the media .
what did they really have to hide ?
the question arises automatically .
in any case , a blemish will stain the former social democrat-green government 's as well as the current foreign minister 's record for having handled the case quite bureaucratically and cold-bloodedly . a veil of secrecy still hangs over why alleged security risk , murat kurnaz , had to be kept away from germany for years under all the circumstances and then in 2006 could return home due to the initiative of schröder 's successor angela merkel . steinmeier 's explanation that kurnaz was released for humanitarian reasons sounds construed because then by that logic , he should have been freed at the end of 2002 .
the real , inhuman nature of the guantanamo bay prison camp was already notorious worldwide at the time .
one way out would have been to get kurnaz back to germany and to try him here if the allegations against him had proved to carry weight .
instead , steinmeier tried to get kurnaz released to turkey .
it was a strange tack and a reminder of the fact that ever after his release , kurnaz until today is described as a security risk by german security officials . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends handling of guantanamo detainee case german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied that his actions caused the german born-turk , murat kurnaz , to spend years suffering in guantanamo bay before being released without charge .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties . unveiling the anti-terrorism database in berlin on friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it was needed to strengthen security in view of the threat posed by islamic terrorists . " it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
other details cover bank account and safety deposit box information , school , university and apprenticeship data , family status and religious affiliation as well as travel data , including visits to areas suspected of housing terrorist training camps . " an effective and measured instrument " the government put the finishing touches to the new law last year , following a failed terrorist attack in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains .
the bombs were discovered by police on july 31 and did not detonate . a lebanese and syrian were arrested in germany in connection with the plot and four lebanese were detained in lebanon .

" it is a useful , reasonable step which shows that germany takes the fight against islamic terrorism very seriously , " schäuble said . the computer databank allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .

similar concerns are shared by others in europe . in a classroom at the university of copenhagen , political science professor morten rasmussen is kicking off a course on the history of the european court of justice .
although he is teaching the course in the danish capital to mostly danish students , the language of instruction here is english . " english here in europe is becoming the major academic language , " he said .
" most european universities are offering courses in english to attract students within europe , also from beyond , and to improve internationalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more university courses are only being offered in english increasingly , school administrators see economic and educational benefits in teaching in the language of shakespeare and milton , or at least a version of it , instead of the national tongue .
the trend is particularly pronounced in science and business courses .
currently , almost a third of education programs in denmark are taught in english , and that number is likely to rise . but for linguists and others who work with the danish language , there are concerns that in the race to become a global player in a world where english is the lingua franca , danish could be left in the dust . " okay , we have these intentions , we want to be a global nation , " said sabine kirchmeier-andersen , a director at the danish language council .
" do we want to lose the danish language ?
is this a price we would like to pay ? " warning : language in decline last month , the council sent a statement to the government expressing concerns that danish risks being undermined on its own turf from the onslaught of english .
while many danes are bilingual , and english is widespread in the media and in advertising , she and others fear that as education institutions move away from danish , the language , which has around five million speakers , could lose some of its functionality . words for innovations , especially in the realm of information technology , or for ideas born in the university classroom or research lab , could only find expression in english .

but what she finds disturbing is that some danish companies , even when recruiting employees in denmark , often choose to advertise only in english .
she worries that it could lead to a fragmentation of danish society . " there will be an elite where people in senior business positions will be speaking english and send their children to schools where they only speak english , " she said .
" then you have the rest of the people who will not be able to understand what is actually going on .

" there 's no doubt that the existing human rights system was meant to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities , " she said .
" there 's also no doubt that the existing standards and mechanisms have in fact failed to provide adequate protection to the specific cases of persons with disabilities . " there are some 650 million people with disabilities in the world right now , according to un statistics .
while that makes up about 10 percent of the global population , 80 percent of the disabled are believed to live in developing countries with limited or no access to services they need to cope better with their physical handicaps . small step for un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries also need to do more to support people with disabilities arbour said she hoped to elevate the profile of the issue of the rights of people with disabilities , and her office would take the lead in establishing partnerships with non-governmental organizations and nations . even in western , industrialized countries , such as germany , the disabled still have to overcome discrimination , despite the legal rights they have obtained , according to karin evers-meyer , germany 's commissioner representing the right of disabled people . she said that while the convention represented a small step for the un , it could lead to a major improvement for people with disabilities by mandating that signatories work against stereotypes and prejudices and grant better access to public spaces , buildings and transportation . german schools need improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany maintains several types of schools for children with disabilities german schools , in particular , need to do more to integrate the handicapped into traditional classes , evers-meyer said . " the integration of young disabled people in the school system here has largely failed , " she said .
" despite numerous declarations of intent to change for the better , our integration rate has been a meager 12 percent for many years now . " other european countries have integrated 80 percent of their disabled students into mainstream classes , while germany sticks to a system of keeping handicapped students in special schools created after world war ii , she added . " after the nazi period , in which so many disabled people were killed , there was a huge , well-meant drive to create a special school for every kind of disability , " she said .
" my colleagues in other countries look at me in disbelief when i tell them that we have eight or nine different types of schools for the disabled . " german education experts have been debating whether changes should be made to the country 's school system after a un study last week criticized germany for doing a poor job of integrating children with disabilities and immigrants into mainstream classes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad parents could face fines for delinquent kids parents who do n't take responsibility for their delinquent children should pay the consequences .

they warned of " appropriate measures " if tehran does not release them immediately . the eu called on iran to release the 15 british sailors and marines it is holding in its custody " immediately " and sent a warning it would " decide on appropriate measures " if tehran did not comply . the statement did not elaborate on what such measures would be . the eu told tehran to tell the british government where the prisoners are being held to allow british diplomats access to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign secretary margaret beckett had hoped for a strongly-worded statement from the eu - she got it in a statement released after eu foreign ministers met in bremen , germany , on friday , they said " all evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure , the british naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission in iraqi waters in accordance with united nations security council resolution 1723 . " " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

" " the seizure , " the statement went on to say , " represents a clear breach of international law . " the eu statement is stronger than that of the un security council which on thursday expressed " grave concern " at the naval personnel 's detention but declined to back britain with a call for their immediate release . " a big mistake " britain froze official contacts on wednesday with iran as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified , with prime minister tony blair vowing to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran . eu foreign policy chief javier solana called the iranian action " a big mistake " and called for the release of the sailors , who were captured on march 23 . " i do n't understand .
it 's a big mistake .
they should release the soldiers immediately , " he said as he entered the meeting .
" i have total confidence that the british boat was in iraqi waters , " he added , alluding to iran 's claims that the boat had entered its waters . however , there was opposition in the eu to freezing business with tehran , which diplomats said britain had initially sought . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said friday that all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between britain and iran . " we must avert a course towards confrontation , any escalation , " said douste-blazy in an interview to rtl radio .
" the iranian authorities must simply return to dialog . " british sailor apologizes on iranian tv britain insists the 14 men and one woman were in iraqi waters carrying out routine anti-smuggling operations when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london disputes that its sailors trespassed into iranian waters meanwhile iranian television broadcast footage of three of captured british sailors and marines on friday and said one had confessed to entering iranian waters illegally and had apologized to the iranian people . " we trespassed without permission .
since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly .
we have not been harmed at all , " one of them , whose name was read out as nathan thomas summers , said on state television .
" i would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ...
i deeply apologize , " he said .
" they have looked after us really well . " the informal eu meeting in bremen was a chance for the ministers to discuss the top issues of the day without being constrained by the need to reach agreed conclusions . this one was scheduled to focus on kosovo and the middle east , but " with the current situation with the british soldiers there is a particular case , " an eu diplomat said . call for un inquiry the initial british draft for the un , circulated wednesday , had asked the council to " deplore the continuing detention by the government of iran of 15 uk naval personnel " and to back " calls for -lrb- their -rrb- immediate release . " but britain failed to win council support for the strong statement , call for the sailors ' immediate release , and state that they were seized in iraqi waters , because of opposition from some council members , primarily russia . russia 's foreign ministry on friday said the united nations should conduct an independent probe of circumstances surrounding the capture of the british sailors by iran .
the ministry made the call in a statement released after talks between british ambassador anthony brenton and russian deputy foreign minister alexander yakovenko . " taking into consideration the fact that the british side insists the service personnel were fulfilling the mandate of the un security council , we consider that the un secretariat should prepare an independent report regarding this particular incident , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain seeks to increase world pressure on iran britain has taken its escalating crisis with iran over 15 captured sailors to the un security council , as the iranian government said it would not release the one woman among the detainees .

picturing 9/11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tabloids used a tv movie as an excuse to show the tv tower in flames arden pennell is disgusted by the gall of berlin 's tabloids as they used the opportunity of a made-for-tv movie to plaster berlin 's tv tower in flames on their front pages . picture the most tasteless , offensive paper-selling strategy , one that would make william randolph hearst blush .
now multiply that by 10 to get an idea of the low to which berlin 's illustrated dailies sunk with thursday 's front-page picture of the city 's iconic tv tower sprouting a billowing grey cloud , a la the burning world trade center towers .
parroting the instantly iconic " smoking skyscraper " image plastered across the front page of every newspaper in the world on september 12th , 2007 , the berliner kurier as well as b.z. and yes , bild , reached a new nadir in taste .
the picture stems from a made-for-tv movie - it is not related in the faintest to reality .
it 's entertainment .
but then again , the same could be said of the " newspapers " that printed it .
perhaps it is pointless to accost tabloids for using sensationalism .
there are no standards for trash ; if there were , it would be journalism .
the other illustrated dailies , that is , papers of non-tabloid status with pretensions to real reporting , did n't even register the tv show .
but i 'm still offended .
maybe the tabloid editors did n't get the memo , but this was a tragedy in which thousands of people died , and one responsible for the eventual deaths of many more as it ignited american foreign policy to pursue an aggressive , imperialist code of invade-and-occupy .
call me touchy , but trying to get rich off of the event 's terror-inducing memory is utterly crude , especially for tabloids that have n't slightest pretense of using the attention bought by the stunt to say anything of substance .
-lrb- and c 'mon , was n't anyone bludgeoned in their sleep last night in berlin ?
did n't someone see jesus in their morning coffee ?
for these papers , there is always plenty of front page news to go around . -rrb-
excessive press for knut ?
my fellow correspondent joel recently wrote about his affection for the german custom of gathering daily at the newspaper kiosk to discuss the news over a morning cigarette .
i wonder what they said on thursday : " looks like an interesting movie , " or " what tacky commercialism " or possibly " where are the soccer scores ? "
perhaps the image did n't even register very much , bombarded and desensitized as readers are by the classic september 11th picture it is copying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german - and world - media ca n't seem to get enough of knut i do know what the newspaper sellers had to say about it .
the young man who sold me my berliner kurier shook his head .
" it 's exaggerated and misleading , " he criticized as he handed me my change .
" you ca n't even tell it 's about a tv show at first . " when i bought my second -lrb- yet nearly identical -rrb- newspaper at a nearby kiosk , the salesman decried the excessive press given to the baby polar bear at the berlin zoo .
" two weeks of the same crap , " he sighed .
" you know how much money the zoo is making off of this ? "
and he quoted an exact figure .
he is certainly following the news closely , yet this crass image did n't even catch his radar .
he 's probably seen it too many times before .
news as entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german papers have trouble identifying what 's news and this could be the irony of the whole tasteless endeavor : the tabloids would like to bank off the well-known nature of the first image to sell the second , re-inducing a mix of horror and curiosity , but it is precisely this well-known nature that renders readers apathetic at second glace .
or maybe the irony , like the devil , lies in the details : the film is being produced by wiedemann & berg , the same team that turned out " the lives of others " -lrb- das leben der anderen -rrb- , a high-brow work that won best foreign film at the academy awards .
this seems to indicate that the latest work , " the inferno : flames over berlin , " will rise above its vulgar debut on the front pages when broadcast in may .
or not .
either way , we can always look forward to the next day 's news for more entertainment . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns dw-world : the suffering of “ others ” the stasi has been getting a lot of press lately , thanks to florian henckel von donnersmarck ’ s academy award-winning film the lives of others , and arden pennell went to an old stasi prison to learn more .

father nguyen van ly is a prominent democracy activist and long-time opponent of communist party rule .
the 60-year-old has been under house arrest since early february .
his trial lasted one day .
four co-defendants received prison terms ranging from 18 months suspended to six years .
" the behaviour of the defendants amounts to the crime of spreading propaganda against the socialist state " , judge bui quoc hiep told the court in the central city of hue .
earlier , a policeman had removed father ly from the court after he shouted " down with the communist party " .
in an unusual move , journalists were allowed limited access to the proceedings .
political crackdown father ly has already spent 14 of the past 24 years in prison , the bbc 's chris xia reports .
he was last jailed in 2001 after he urged the us to link its trade policy with vietnam 's human rights record .
he was released as part of an amnesty in 2005 .
father ly is a founding member of bloc 8406 , a pro-democracy movement launched last april .
he is also a member of the progression party .
leading members of both groups have been detained in recent months , our reporter adds , in what appears to have been a concerted drive against opponents of the communist government .
an envoy from the vatican raised the case of father ly with the authorities during a visit to vietnam earlier this month , but the envoy would not say what vietnam 's response was .
state media has accused father ly and other pro-democracy activists of trying to undermine the communist party by forming illegal parties to field candidates in national assembly elections in may .
only the communist party is allowed to stand , although a small number of seats are reserved for non-party members .

tjx added that the security breach may also have involved tk maxx customers in the uk and ireland .
but the company added that at least three-quarters of the affected cards had expired or data had been masked .

" we do n't know what was in those files - the technology the hacker used prevents tjx from knowing , and also the fact that tjx system routinely deletes files , " the spokesperson added .
the data was accessed on tjx 's systems in watford , hertfordshire , and massachusetts over a 16-month period from july 2005 and covers transactions made by credit and debit card dating as far back as december 2002 .
sandra quinn from the association of payment clearing services -lrb- apacs -rrb- told the bbc there had been a " massive " compromise of security - on a scale not seen before .
however , she said that that for most people , the card details stolen would no longer be relevant .
" if they were doing transactions with tk maxx between those dates they will generally now have a brand new credit or debit card in their wallet , so they can be sure that it will be the old details of their card that has been compromised , not their current card . "

in its filing to the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- the group said it believed " the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by tjx " .
it also admitted it did not know who , or how many people , were behind the attack , or whether there had been one breach or many .
the papers also said that a further 455,000 customers who returned merchandise without receipts had personal data stolen - including driver 's licence numbers .
however , the firm does not believe return customers at its uk stores were affected - or that chip and pin data in the uk was accessed as none is stored on the systems in watford .
the company warned many of its operations could be affected .
hackers managed to access information from its tj maxx , marshalls and homegoods shops in the us and puerto rico , bob 's stores in the us , and winners and homesense shops in canada .
ben cammarata , tjx chairman and acting chief executive , urged customers to check their credit and debit cards statements and any other account information for unauthorised use .
" we are deeply concerned about this event and the difficulties it may cause our customers , " he added .

david rees , a team leader , began working at the warehouse , then known as polikoff 's , straight from school and continued at the factory for 47 years .
it was there he met his wife , pauline , who worked as a wages clerk for 22 years until she left in 1980 .
their daughter emma was employed by burberry , which took over the factory in 1989 , on quality inspection for six years .
" burberry has been a real family concern , " said mr rees .
" in general terms it is like one big family here - everybody is friends with each other and everybody knows each other . "
the clothing firm announced in september it planned to end production at the factory because it was not " commercially viable " .
i ca n't see myself getting a job at 62 - i have got my allotment to look after so i will probably spend more time on that david rees burberry finally shut the doors after a three-month extension to the original closure date to allow staff to retrain and find alternative work .
of the original 309 workers facing unemployment , 175 have already found other jobs .
but mr rees is not confident he will find other work close to home .
" i ca n't see myself getting a job at 62 , " he said .
" i have got my allotment to look after so i will probably spend more time on that .
david rees met his wife pauline at the factory " i will manage financially , but i do n't know about the younger people in the factory .
" i have been paying into my pension and i have been gearing up for retirement .
" i feel terrible for the younger workers because there is nothing in the valleys for them now .
" it means that they will have to travel out of the valley to find work but a lot of them have n't got transport . "
people crying burberry have offered a multi-million pound package to workers in the form of a loyalty bonus and community trust fund , but mr rees said he will remain bitter about treorchy production being moved overseas .
" i 'm gutted about burberry , " he said .
" all the years i have been here - i think it is very shoddy the way they have gone about it .
" it is just pure greed .
they could have kept the factory going , no problem .
" there have been a lot of people crying on the shop floor this last week . "

by mark savage bbc news entertainment reporter joss stone was signed by new york record label s-curve joss stone 's latest album , introducing joss stone , has stormed into the us charts at number two - the highest ever debut for a uk female artist , according to music week magazine .
her success follows hot on the heels of other uk artists like amy winehouse , kt tunstall , james blunt and snow patrol , all of whom have scored us chart success in the last 12 months .
it seems reminiscent of the so-called " british invasions " , which saw a wave uk acts conquer america in the 1960s and 80s - but just five years ago , these achievements would have seemed impossible .
in april 2002 , there were no british acts in the us top 100 singles rundown for the first time in 38 years .
this all coincides with a golden time for uk artists chris dwyer , universal records international stars like robbie williams found their albums shelved and no british girl band could match the all-conquering impact of the spice girls .
so why have british artists suddenly found favour with the american public ?
what makes lily allen a more attractive prospect than robbie williams ?
how can bloc party be making strides where oasis have stumbled ?
' exotic ' snow patrol were featured on hit us tv show grey 's anatomy " the answer is i think we 're back to a normal flow , " says sean ross , vice president of music at us market research firm edison media research .
" it 's not so much what is happening now as what went wrong for a brief period . "
ross says british acts suffered at the turn of the century because us radio had stopped playing pure pop and mainstream rock .
the problem was compounded by us record labels " not pursuing british projects aggressively as they should " .
" i was at a launch party for the sugababes when they came here with their overload single , " says mr ross .
" to me that always sounded like a hit record , but here it was treated as something very different .
" people were convinced that these records were too exotic , but so many records break through tv now that exotic is suddenly an asset . "
i really did have to make a decision to knuckle down natasha bedingfield snow patrol are just one uk group who have utilised the power of tv to sell their records in the us .
their chasing cars single became a top five hit after it was played over the closing scenes of the second season of medical drama grey 's anatomy .
chris dwyer , who heads the international department at universal , the band 's record label , says british acts have increasingly had to look for alternative means to promote their music .
" tie-ups for things like adverts have become very important , " she says .
" online has also become very important - there has been a great democratisation of what people can hear because of the internet .
" and , of course , just old-fashioned getting out there and playing to people ! "
' knuckle down ' natasha bedingfield puts her us success down to hard work pop star natasha bedingfield agrees that playing to new audiences is a key to success .
she says it took sheer hard work to score a top five hit - as she did with her single , unwritten , in 2005 .
" initially i only went to america for a month or something and then it just extended because people started to play the record on the radio and love it , " she says .
" i really did have to make a decision to knuckle down and do the hard yards because i was a complete unknown .
" in the end i was there for a year and a half . "
hard work was also the recipe for james blunt 's us success - although in this case it was the record label who put in the extra hours .
" atlantic records worked the oprah people for months to pitch james , " says blunt 's manager , todd interland .
blunt was the first uk artist in a decade to have a us number one " he went on the show , he charmed her , he charmed the audience and that 's when the record exploded .
interland , who signed blunt on a " gut feeling " that his music would appeal to audiences around the world , says the time is ripe for british acts to make headway in the us .
" right now , the american market is in a little bit of a black hole with regards to good music .
" there 's some interesting things but most of it is a bit samey .
hip-hop has got into a bit of a glut , " he says .
chris dwyer at universal records agrees , but says that the uk 's chart success across the pond all boils down to one thing .
" this all coincides with a golden time for uk artists , " she says .
" people like james morrison , amy winehouse and the fratellis - they all make excellent records . "

by mark savage bbc news entertainment reporter joss stone was signed by new york record label s-curve joss stone 's latest album , introducing joss stone , has stormed into the us charts at number two - the highest ever debut for a uk female artist , according to music week magazine .
her success follows hot on the heels of other uk artists like amy winehouse , kt tunstall , james blunt and snow patrol , all of whom have scored us chart success in the last 12 months .
it seems reminiscent of the so-called " british invasions " , which saw a wave uk acts conquer america in the 1960s and 80s - but just five years ago , these achievements would have seemed impossible .
in april 2002 , there were no british acts in the us top 100 singles rundown for the first time in 38 years .
this all coincides with a golden time for uk artists chris dwyer , universal records international stars like robbie williams found their albums shelved and no british girl band could match the all-conquering impact of the spice girls .
so why have british artists suddenly found favour with the american public ?
what makes lily allen a more attractive prospect than robbie williams ?
how can bloc party be making strides where oasis have stumbled ?
' exotic ' snow patrol were featured on hit us tv show grey 's anatomy " the answer is i think we 're back to a normal flow , " says sean ross , vice president of music at us market research firm edison media research .
" it 's not so much what is happening now as what went wrong for a brief period . "
ross says british acts suffered at the turn of the century because us radio had stopped playing pure pop and mainstream rock .
the problem was compounded by us record labels " not pursuing british projects aggressively as they should " .
" i was at a launch party for the sugababes when they came here with their overload single , " says mr ross .
" to me that always sounded like a hit record , but here it was treated as something very different .
" people were convinced that these records were too exotic , but so many records break through tv now that exotic is suddenly an asset . "
i really did have to make a decision to knuckle down natasha bedingfield snow patrol are just one uk group who have utilised the power of tv to sell their records in the us .
their chasing cars single became a top five hit after it was played over the closing scenes of the second season of medical drama grey 's anatomy .
chris dwyer , who heads the international department at universal , the band 's record label , says british acts have increasingly had to look for alternative means to promote their music .
" tie-ups for things like adverts have become very important , " she says .
" online has also become very important - there has been a great democratisation of what people can hear because of the internet .
" and , of course , just old-fashioned getting out there and playing to people ! "
' knuckle down ' natasha bedingfield puts her us success down to hard work pop star natasha bedingfield agrees that playing to new audiences is a key to success .
she says it took sheer hard work to score a top five hit - as she did with her single , unwritten , in 2005 .
" initially i only went to america for a month or something and then it just extended because people started to play the record on the radio and love it , " she says .
" i really did have to make a decision to knuckle down and do the hard yards because i was a complete unknown .
" in the end i was there for a year and a half . "
hard work was also the recipe for james blunt 's us success - although in this case it was the record label who put in the extra hours .
" atlantic records worked the oprah people for months to pitch james , " says blunt 's manager , todd interland .
blunt was the first uk artist in a decade to have a us number one " he went on the show , he charmed her , he charmed the audience and that 's when the record exploded .
interland , who signed blunt on a " gut feeling " that his music would appeal to audiences around the world , says the time is ripe for british acts to make headway in the us .
" right now , the american market is in a little bit of a black hole with regards to good music .
" there 's some interesting things but most of it is a bit samey .
hip-hop has got into a bit of a glut , " he says .
chris dwyer at universal records agrees , but says that the uk 's chart success across the pond all boils down to one thing .
" this all coincides with a golden time for uk artists , " she says .
" people like james morrison , amy winehouse and the fratellis - they all make excellent records . "

now , approaching his 90th birthday , he still takes pleasure in being outrageous .
at one point during my interview with him for a special edition of bbc radio four 's archive hour to mark his forthcoming birthday , he claimed to have personally succeeded in stopping further world conflict in the period since the end of the second world war .
he had become a politician , he said , to stop the third world war , but could n't help adding : " i do n't know if you 'd noticed - but i succeeded . "
to be fair , he added that he had had " some help from the atom bomb " .
sdp breakaway his pronouncement may be a little over the top , but he can claim with rather more justification to have ensured that the labour party remained as the main alternative to the conservatives at a time in the 1980s when there was a real question over whether it would survive as a major political force .
as he says , had he joined the sdp when it was set up in 1981 , there could have been a haemorrhage of support form labour to the breakaway party .
as it was , he stayed in the labour party and saw off a challenge from tony benn for the deputy leadership .
denis healey has always been a mixture of the bruiser and the intellectual .
sometimes he used his intellect to deliberately intimidate his colleagues .
lord healey thinks it is time for tony blair to leave office at others he used his gift for humour to give his insults added potency - most famously equating being attacked by his conservative opposite number , and as it turns out his friend , sir geoffrey howe - to being " savaged by a dead sheep " .
he began his political life as a communist and made his first appearance at the labour party conference as a leftwing firebrand .
but he rapidly became more pragmatic .
indeed he describes his political philosophy as " eclectic pragmatism with a strong moral streak " .
the other strand running throughout his political career is a contempt for those in the labour party he branded as " oppositionalists " : nye bevan and more recently tony benn , whom he describes him as a man of " destructive innocence - a charming man , silver-tongued , but with very , very bad judgement indeed " .
nowadays he and his wife edna spend most of their time at their house in east sussex .
he is thinner since becoming an elder statesman , but his intellectual confidence remains undimmed as is his ability to draw on a huge canvas of memories and interests outside politics ; and his trademark eyebrows are as bushy as ever .
' not clubbable enough ' he admits to very few regrets , other , perhaps , than not becoming foreign secretary .
he never became prime minister either or labour leader , despite standing twice .
he acknowledges this may have been because he was not " clubbable enough " and nor was he ever totally single-minded about politics .
there was always what his wife described as his " hinterland " of other interests which set him apart from most politicians , and which sustain him in retirement : photography , music , art books and poetry .
do n't tell edna : the then chancellor kept his problems out of the home but if he did n't get the top job , he did have a huge impact on two labour administrations .
as defence secretary in the 1960s , he was responsible for withdrawing british troops east of suez .
it was the job he enjoyed most of his career because it enabled him to use all the contacts he had developed in his post-war years in the united states , the middle east and europe as international secretary for the labour party .
then in l974 harold wilson made him chancellor .
it was , he says , a " herculean task " clearing up the mess left by the heath 's conservatives .
his inheritance was a very difficult one : the aftermath of a miners ' strike , power cuts and the three-day week .
his difficulties were compounded by successive shocks from the outside world .
blackpool rocked the financial markets lost faith in the labour government , and eventually healey was forced to go to the international monetary fund for a conditional loan .
at the very last moment , he was forced to cancel a foreign trip and fly to blackpool to urge the party to accept more spending cuts .
it was widely perceived as a humiliation but , 35 years later , he denies it was .
" there was more support for me at the end of my speech than the beginning . "
he also reveals that despite the closeness of his marriage , he had not told edna of the crisis facing him on the economy , and that she was totally shocked when they suddenly had to head for blackpool .
" i did n't want to worry her , " he says .
the one mistake he admits to making was in imposing too strict a pay policy in l978 .
that led to the " winter of discontent " , when public sector workers went on strike , arguably paving the way for mrs thatcher 's victory the following year .
thatcher years he thinks the government could have " got away with " a higher pay ceiling of perhaps 10 % .
instead it went for 5 % in the face of union opposition and the strikes began .
" it was silly to expect to get it .
that was a mistake " .
to that extent he acknowledges contributing to labour 's downfall , but , he says : " i do n't believe we deserved the alternative we actually got . "
looking at his various labour successors , he is probably most praiseworthy of john smith 's one-member-one-vote reforms on the union block vote .

now , approaching his 90th birthday , he still takes pleasure in being outrageous .
at one point during my interview with him for a special edition of bbc radio four 's archive hour to mark his forthcoming birthday , he claimed to have personally succeeded in stopping further world conflict in the period since the end of the second world war .
he had become a politician , he said , to stop the third world war , but could n't help adding : " i do n't know if you 'd noticed - but i succeeded . "
to be fair , he added that he had had " some help from the atom bomb " .
sdp breakaway his pronouncement may be a little over the top , but he can claim with rather more justification to have ensured that the labour party remained as the main alternative to the conservatives at a time in the 1980s when there was a real question over whether it would survive as a major political force .
as he says , had he joined the sdp when it was set up in 1981 , there could have been a haemorrhage of support form labour to the breakaway party .
as it was , he stayed in the labour party and saw off a challenge from tony benn for the deputy leadership .
denis healey has always been a mixture of the bruiser and the intellectual .
sometimes he used his intellect to deliberately intimidate his colleagues .
lord healey thinks it is time for tony blair to leave office at others he used his gift for humour to give his insults added potency - most famously equating being attacked by his conservative opposite number , and as it turns out his friend , sir geoffrey howe - to being " savaged by a dead sheep " .
he began his political life as a communist and made his first appearance at the labour party conference as a leftwing firebrand .
but he rapidly became more pragmatic .
indeed he describes his political philosophy as " eclectic pragmatism with a strong moral streak " .
the other strand running throughout his political career is a contempt for those in the labour party he branded as " oppositionalists " : nye bevan and more recently tony benn , whom he describes him as a man of " destructive innocence - a charming man , silver-tongued , but with very , very bad judgement indeed " .
nowadays he and his wife edna spend most of their time at their house in east sussex .
he is thinner since becoming an elder statesman , but his intellectual confidence remains undimmed as is his ability to draw on a huge canvas of memories and interests outside politics ; and his trademark eyebrows are as bushy as ever .
' not clubbable enough ' he admits to very few regrets , other , perhaps , than not becoming foreign secretary .
he never became prime minister either or labour leader , despite standing twice .
he acknowledges this may have been because he was not " clubbable enough " and nor was he ever totally single-minded about politics .
there was always what his wife described as his " hinterland " of other interests which set him apart from most politicians , and which sustain him in retirement : photography , music , art books and poetry .
do n't tell edna : the then chancellor kept his problems out of the home but if he did n't get the top job , he did have a huge impact on two labour administrations .
as defence secretary in the 1960s , he was responsible for withdrawing british troops east of suez .
it was the job he enjoyed most of his career because it enabled him to use all the contacts he had developed in his post-war years in the united states , the middle east and europe as international secretary for the labour party .
then in l974 harold wilson made him chancellor .
it was , he says , a " herculean task " clearing up the mess left by the heath 's conservatives .
his inheritance was a very difficult one : the aftermath of a miners ' strike , power cuts and the three-day week .
his difficulties were compounded by successive shocks from the outside world .
blackpool rocked the financial markets lost faith in the labour government , and eventually healey was forced to go to the international monetary fund for a conditional loan .
at the very last moment , he was forced to cancel a foreign trip and fly to blackpool to urge the party to accept more spending cuts .
it was widely perceived as a humiliation but , 35 years later , he denies it was .
" there was more support for me at the end of my speech than the beginning . "
he also reveals that despite the closeness of his marriage , he had not told edna of the crisis facing him on the economy , and that she was totally shocked when they suddenly had to head for blackpool .
" i did n't want to worry her , " he says .
the one mistake he admits to making was in imposing too strict a pay policy in l978 .
that led to the " winter of discontent " , when public sector workers went on strike , arguably paving the way for mrs thatcher 's victory the following year .
thatcher years he thinks the government could have " got away with " a higher pay ceiling of perhaps 10 % .
instead it went for 5 % in the face of union opposition and the strikes began .
" it was silly to expect to get it .
that was a mistake " .
to that extent he acknowledges contributing to labour 's downfall , but , he says : " i do n't believe we deserved the alternative we actually got . "
looking at his various labour successors , he is probably most praiseworthy of john smith 's one-member-one-vote reforms on the union block vote .
as for tony blair , while complimentary about his achievements and approach in his early years , he now believes it is time to hand over to his chancellor .

sdp breakaway his pronouncement may be a little over the top , but he can claim with rather more justification to have ensured that the labour party remained as the main alternative to the conservatives at a time in the 1980s when there was a real question over whether it would survive as a major political force .
as he says , had he joined the sdp when it was set up in 1981 , there could have been a haemorrhage of support form labour to the breakaway party .
as it was , he stayed in the labour party and saw off a challenge from tony benn for the deputy leadership .
denis healey has always been a mixture of the bruiser and the intellectual .
sometimes he used his intellect to deliberately intimidate his colleagues .
lord healey thinks it is time for tony blair to leave office at others he used his gift for humour to give his insults added potency - most famously equating being attacked by his conservative opposite number , and as it turns out his friend , sir geoffrey howe - to being " savaged by a dead sheep " .
he began his political life as a communist and made his first appearance at the labour party conference as a leftwing firebrand .
but he rapidly became more pragmatic .
indeed he describes his political philosophy as " eclectic pragmatism with a strong moral streak " .
the other strand running throughout his political career is a contempt for those in the labour party he branded as " oppositionalists " : nye bevan and more recently tony benn , whom he describes him as a man of " destructive innocence - a charming man , silver-tongued , but with very , very bad judgement indeed " .
nowadays he and his wife edna spend most of their time at their house in east sussex .
he is thinner since becoming an elder statesman , but his intellectual confidence remains undimmed as is his ability to draw on a huge canvas of memories and interests outside politics ; and his trademark eyebrows are as bushy as ever .
' not clubbable enough ' he admits to very few regrets , other , perhaps , than not becoming foreign secretary .
he never became prime minister either or labour leader , despite standing twice .
he acknowledges this may have been because he was not " clubbable enough " and nor was he ever totally single-minded about politics .
there was always what his wife described as his " hinterland " of other interests which set him apart from most politicians , and which sustain him in retirement : photography , music , art books and poetry .
do n't tell edna : the then chancellor kept his problems out of the home but if he did n't get the top job , he did have a huge impact on two labour administrations .
as defence secretary in the 1960s , he was responsible for withdrawing british troops east of suez .
it was the job he enjoyed most of his career because it enabled him to use all the contacts he had developed in his post-war years in the united states , the middle east and europe as international secretary for the labour party .
then in l974 harold wilson made him chancellor .
it was , he says , a " herculean task " clearing up the mess left by the heath 's conservatives .
his inheritance was a very difficult one : the aftermath of a miners ' strike , power cuts and the three-day week .
his difficulties were compounded by successive shocks from the outside world .
blackpool rocked the financial markets lost faith in the labour government , and eventually healey was forced to go to the international monetary fund for a conditional loan .
at the very last moment , he was forced to cancel a foreign trip and fly to blackpool to urge the party to accept more spending cuts .
it was widely perceived as a humiliation but , 35 years later , he denies it was .
" there was more support for me at the end of my speech than the beginning . "
he also reveals that despite the closeness of his marriage , he had not told edna of the crisis facing him on the economy , and that she was totally shocked when they suddenly had to head for blackpool .
" i did n't want to worry her , " he says .
the one mistake he admits to making was in imposing too strict a pay policy in l978 .
that led to the " winter of discontent " , when public sector workers went on strike , arguably paving the way for mrs thatcher 's victory the following year .
thatcher years he thinks the government could have " got away with " a higher pay ceiling of perhaps 10 % .
instead it went for 5 % in the face of union opposition and the strikes began .
" it was silly to expect to get it .
that was a mistake " .
to that extent he acknowledges contributing to labour 's downfall , but , he says : " i do n't believe we deserved the alternative we actually got . "
looking at his various labour successors , he is probably most praiseworthy of john smith 's one-member-one-vote reforms on the union block vote .
as for tony blair , while complimentary about his achievements and approach in his early years , he now believes it is time to hand over to his chancellor .
" the sooner tony goes the better . "

thailand is not the only state to prosecute those who offend their head of state , though few such laws are as draconian .
its law carries a maximum prison sentence of 75 years .
one step beyond - henry viii equated lese majeste with treason the concept of " lese-majeste " -lrb- literally , injury to the majesty -rrb- as a crime goes back to ancient rome and was jealously guarded by absolute monarchs in medieval europe , while something similar existed in asian cultures .
in brunei , which like thailand is ruled by a monarchy , three men were jailed for a year in 2006 for sending mobile phone clips judged seditious and insulting to sultan hassanal bolkiah and his family .
laws protecting the " dignity " of a monarch have been borrowed by many modern republics .
in the indian ocean state of the maldives , three journalists were sentenced to life in 2002 for " insulting the president " and setting up a newsletter critical of the government .
in poland , a member of the european union , you can technically get up to three years for offending the president .
given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better yas , malta bbc news website reader that protection is extended to any foreign head of state visiting the country .
thus police arrested 28 demonstrators in 2005 who were protesting against president vladimir putin of russia , a country which has not enjoyed good relations with its western neighbour at the best of times .
the chief concern about insult laws among human rights campaigners is that they can be used to stifle freedom of expression .
a basic right " freedom of speech is one of the most basic human rights , " a spokesperson for amnesty international told the bbc news website .
egypt jailed blogger abdel kareem soliman for insulting its leader " no state should be prosecuting any individual for expressing an opinion held peacefully . "
amnesty is not quibbling with laws on defamation or incitement which , it says , rightfully exist in any state to protect individuals and the community .
but other than these recognised limits on freedom of speech , there should be no restrictions , it argues .
republics which have prosecuted people for insulting their heads of state in recent years are typified by authoritarian leaders an egyptian court sentenced blogger abdel kareem soliman in february to four years in prison for insulting islam and president hosni mubarak kazakhstan gave journalist kaziz toguzbayev a two-year suspended sentence in january for " insulting the honour and dignity " of president nursultan nazarbayev zimbabwe gave a two-year suspended sentence to businessman jason gambitzs in 2004 for denigrating president robert mugabe by saying he had " printed useless money " belarus sentenced two opposition figures , valeriy levonevskiy and alexander vasiliev , in 2004 for publicly insulting president alexander lukashenko syria sentenced journalist mohammad ghanem to six months in prison in 2006 for charges which included insulting president bashar al-assad access to the popular video-sharing website youtube was suspended in turkey this month after prosecutors told a court that clips had appeared on the site insulting national hero mustafa kemal ataturk - who has been dead for nearly 70 years .
rebellious or rude ?
freedom of speech was not , strictly speaking , at issue in thailand 's prosecution of oliver jufer , who admitted spray-painting several portraits of the king while drunk .
many in thailand see king bhumibol as an anchor of stability " it was the idea that being rude about a government was a very bad idea - it hurt the government but was technically not treason because no act of rebellion was committed , " prof ronald hutton of bristol university told the bbc news website .
" in the days before the idea of constitutional opposition , any opposition was regarded as criminal and anybody who spoke against the government had to be prosecuted because it could incite rebellion . "
if the concept now sounds obscure in that other leading contemporary monarchy britain , it is thanks to king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- , who took personal injury one step further .
" traditionally you have a division in countries between acts against the monarch which are treason and rude things said against the monarch which are ' lese-majeste ' , " prof hutton explains .
" but henry viii passed an act which made speaking against the king treason in itself so ' lese-majeste ' became redundant . "
before anyone gets unduly anxious about offending queen elizabeth ii , it should be pointed out that british parliamentarians dealt with that part of henry 's act long ago .
since the 1790s , prof hutton points out , britain has had freedom of speech legislation which covers most of what was once " treason-by-words " .
your comments well ... if you are walking down the street in london facing massive queen 's portraits on every corner , pretty sure you will be intimidated or annoyed .
j.woo , uk " when in rome , do as the romans .
when in asia , do as the asians , please . "
but what if the roman or asian way is against the basic right of human beings , then what ? unnamed reader this is truly shocking .
respect is earned , not ordained .
i respect the thai people .
they have to live and work under such capricious and vile laws .
i have zero respect for their king that does n't rationally find such laws inhumane ...
he 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .
us " westerners " may not be the beacons of honour and morality to most of you , certainly my country 's leadership is lacking beyond imaging , but i am proud they 're thick-skinned enough not to be disassembled by mere insults .
how fragile thailand 's monarchy must be if they fear the act of a drunkard ...
i question the upbringing of some of you that support this garbage .
any of those that suggest to blindly follow authority have clearly lost some capability ... called thinking .
if you defend such onerous nonsense , you should be jailed along with the drunk , for supporting such dangerous laws of repression that clearly is a danger to all of thailand ...
from the country that can take its punches and give some back .
peace .
ernesto , washington dc being a thai living in many countries abroad longer than in thailand i find some opinions on the issue most interesting while others to be downright pitiful .
when one travels the world one can not just hold on to one 's own supreme standard but adjust and adapt as one goes along - to make the most of what are on offer and to one 's own benefits and enjoyment .
the swiss has lived for a decade in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with a mild climate , well-mannered gentle people and great choices of food , and at a fraction of what he would have to pay in switzerland .
one day he got drunk and did what not only goes against the law but is also the most offensive act to the thais .
is this not the case of taking out of the land more than he put in ?
he should have left the country if and when he 's so unhappy at the way it 's governed .
in my opinion he deserves what he 's got , perhaps he will make himself useful while serving his sentence ?
i do believe , however , that he will be pardoned one day .
and in a larger picture , i hope , a lesson is learned -lrb- or is it not ? -rrb- and the point is made .
and to those ignorant few the thai king has worked extremely hard throughout his life for his own people and the land , and in so doing he has earned the highest respect and love from his own people .
he is our father .
i now wish to ask how do you treat your own selfless father ?
and how would you feel & react when someone tries to knock him down ?
suraphee simpson , surbiton , surrey , england draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures marc , london bbc news website reader when i lived in thai refugee camps in the 80s , we were not allowed to mess with thai baht which have the king 's pictures or emblem on them .
refugees were beaten up every day just because their lack of respect for the thai king .
even when the thai national anthem is playing , no matter where you are or what you do , you must stand still and straight .
if thailand means the land of the free , then it should reconsider it name .
s. ley , santa ana , us i 'm a filipino living in japan for the last 6 years and have met many thai nationals , and i can say that they truly have a deep respect for their king .
for those who criticize the thai monarch for being pompous or having a temper , i would like to say that the king does not charge anyone with " lese majeste " -lrb- and if i 'm not mistaken , has never had , at least in contemporary thailand -rrb- ; it 's the police that does .
there are cases wherein the said law was indeed abused -lrb- i.e. when politicians accuse their rivals -rrb- , but in the case of mr. jufer , his actions are similar to flag-burning / defacing of national symbols and should be punished , although i would agree that the sentence is draconian indeed .
christian ernest , oita , japan everyone in thailand knows the respect that the royal family , and in particular the king , are held in .
of course one should do what is expected of you in a different country and culture .
having said that the law regarding the thai monarchy serves no one but the powerful - who have managed to hide behind it for their political advantage before -lrb- example thaksin expelling critical foreign journalists on the grounds they insulted the monarchy -rrb- .
this rule does thailand no favours , laws are not needed for the king to be respected -lrb- he has it already -rrb- , social mores are enough to ensure respect is given - it only shows thailand in a poor way to the international community .
tim , seoul korea given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better .
i agree with derek from canada .
the rule is simple : respect the rules of the country you are in , otherwise stay home .
yas , malta the guy has absolutely no excuse .
as foreigners in this country we are all well aware of thais ' respect for their monarch .
they and most foreigners still stand for the national anthem in the cinema before a film .
i am sorry but it 's values like this that form a national identity and give a people pride .
what would happen if you played the national anthem before a film in the uk ?
also the offender will have been well aware in advance that he would be unable to buy alcohol on this day and should have done like all sensible foreigners here and had a supply at home .
paul , pattaya thailand although the court ruling of ten years is very severe , the point in fact is that oliver jufer was disrespectful and vandalous .
he not only went on a rampage of vandalism throughout the city of chang mai but also chose to degrade symbols of the very core of society in the country that was hosting him .
if we had strict such punishment and reverence for our cultural symbols there might be a lot less vandalism in our communities as well .
respect for property and cultural symbols is innate to any nation and this man deliberately went contrary to the respect of that land .
he deserves to be punished .
antonio , tokyo , japan folks need to remember that yes , as draconian and exaggerated as the sentence may appear ... this law is not imposed or even necessarily acknowledged by the king , but is enforced more so by all his subjects who see him as someone who very genuinely holds his people to heart and see him as the one pivotal figure of stability in a country with a history fraught with political instability and corruption and just as any of you might feel angered , even vengeful perhaps at someone demonstrating total , uncalled for disrespect to your immediate family members , so do the thai people feel protective of their king whom they lovingly refer to as father. long term expat resident in thailand , bangkok i find this ridiculous ...
in the 21st century today , people can even freely criticise or insult the gods - who does the thai king think he is ?
god ? or superior than gods ?
outrageous !
people should boycott travel industry in thailand .
such country is a horrified country , every single tourist in there must be cautioned over the unstable politics and their " sacred " king ... who knows maybe some day a single wrong saying about their king there can cost your fortune and life .
wake up , it 's the 21st century not the feudal era .
everyone is an equal individual , we do n't need anyone superior over us .
x , uk having lived in parts of asia for years , i kinda get the whole respects for monarchy thing - its not about respecting a terrifying institution , but about respecting an institution that symbolises a nation and a people , in a way .
if individuals in parts of the ' free ' west can be charged under law for burning the flag of certain nations , what difference defacing a poster depicting a symbol of another ?
if this guy had been simply an ignorant tourist , then he would n't know better , but he had lived in the country for 10 years .
though i hope he is pardoned , i understand why a nation that has made him welcome for such a time might not feel inclined to let him off lightly. penny , glasgow , scotland yet another travesty of thai " justice " .
this says far more about thailand than it does about oliver jufer ; draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures .
marc , london if king bhumibol can truly call himself as such then he should step in and pardon oliver jufer .
richard , london , uk no one brings anything into the world at birth , no one will take anything out of it at death .
everybody , including monarchs , should bear that in mind. wilhelm mistiaen , antwerp , belgium while we enjoy the privilege of international travel , especially to places in asia , we are made aware of , and therefore must abide by , all national and international laws .
many foreigners travelling through such countries seem to think that they are above these laws and that they only apply to the " locals " and that their respective embassies will step up and get them out of trouble .
it 's simple , respect the laws of the countries that let you in .
derek junor , toronto , canada the countries you mentioned are just the tip of the ice-berg .
regimes which need these repressive laws to avoid accountability and shut down public debate are the real traitors .
adrian , melbourne , australia for murdoch in prague : it seems clear from your comments that you understand nothing of respectability , opinions , laws or customs of other countries .
i do wonder what kind of upbringing you were subjected to that you can not see the man was wrong in insulting and not respecting his majesty the king .
furthermore , i do not believe his majesty sees westerners as threats .
the whole issue fundamentally lies with respecting one 's culture , which the west seems to have forgotten how to .
any patriots would understand that .
if you are one , and find your country insulted , i doubt you would write what you , sadly , have written .
respectfully yours , m in oxford .
m , oxford honestly , i find this rather comic and cruel at the same time , on one side you have a drunk and on the other , a king , who in my opinion , must have an explosive temper and turn purple at the mere idea of him being put down .
yes it may be against the law to do so , yet if all of a sudden the king says that he feels that anyone from the west is a threat and should be kicked out to maintain his ego , is that right ?
no , and all this is is one person poking fun at the king .
it poses no threat to the king at all .
so why freak out over an insult ?
now this may sound harsh but why not just quit being self-saturated and care for your people for they are the ones keeping your country alive , it 's not all you sir .
murdoch , prague .
czech republic it is appalling that such extreme laws still exist .
the king of thailand may be loved by his people , but since it is illegal to report anything but good news , they can not possibly know what he is really like .
maybe he is as wonderful as they think , but maybe not .
these draconian laws do not help the monarchy , except to stifle and control any opposition .
i think they are used to stop ordinary thai people learning the truth about how their country is run behind the scenes and by whom .
mary aquila , stockholm , sweden i think it was just a rude act , and an apology should suffice .
personally , i believe it is most insulting to other human to consider oneself a king or queen .
are n't we all created equal ?
jamila thomas , usa / kwt sorry , i am chinese , but i still find this ridiculous .
i know in the ancient asian couture , these kind of acts are very serious crimes .
not just asia , but i guess everywhere of the world .
however , in modern world ?
no way .
do n't claim this asian culture , maybe it 's a thai culture , but it 's not an asian culture , it 's a feudal and out of date practice .
in modern asian societies , we do n't think this " lese majeste " act is any good thing and can represent asian culture .
never !
ps , i criticise our chinese communist leaders and their policies everyday , even the former chairman mao .
ming , china in the far east , we respect our monarchs not only as part of our culture , but even to the extend of our beliefs -lrb- divine majesty -rrb- sometimes .
as such the view of lese majeste is somewhat more serious compared to the " openness " of western culture .
you say , when in rome , do as the romans .
i say , when in asia , do as the asians , please .
t.chunlakorn , thailand i 've lived in thailand for the past five years .
the guy should have known better .
there 's no excuse .
but for " p. kamao " from kenya , saying that it 's normal for westerners not to have any respect , is a foolish and contradictory statement .
i 've been to africa as an ngo and i 've seen the respect that your " elders " have given to the people .
and it was n't pretty .
and i 've lived in asia long enough to realize there is no respect in driving .
this was simply someone making a stupid decision .
you have to remember there are thousands of other westerners living in countries like thailand who are respectful .
t. johnson , bangkok , thailand you know , it may seem outrageous from the western perspective !
but western people should know that respect is very important in most cultures and societies especially in asia and africa .
i think the swiss man is paying for his bad bringing up ! perhaps he grew up without any sense of respect for anybody including his elders , the trend of which is so familiar and normal in western children and adults .
p. kamao , kenya- us bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

he 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .
us " westerners " may not be the beacons of honour and morality to most of you , certainly my country 's leadership is lacking beyond imaging , but i am proud they 're thick-skinned enough not to be disassembled by mere insults .
how fragile thailand 's monarchy must be if they fear the act of a drunkard ...
i question the upbringing of some of you that support this garbage .
any of those that suggest to blindly follow authority have clearly lost some capability ... called thinking .
if you defend such onerous nonsense , you should be jailed along with the drunk , for supporting such dangerous laws of repression that clearly is a danger to all of thailand ...
from the country that can take its punches and give some back .
peace .
ernesto , washington dc being a thai living in many countries abroad longer than in thailand i find some opinions on the issue most interesting while others to be downright pitiful .
when one travels the world one can not just hold on to one 's own supreme standard but adjust and adapt as one goes along - to make the most of what are on offer and to one 's own benefits and enjoyment .
the swiss has lived for a decade in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with a mild climate , well-mannered gentle people and great choices of food , and at a fraction of what he would have to pay in switzerland .
one day he got drunk and did what not only goes against the law but is also the most offensive act to the thais .
is this not the case of taking out of the land more than he put in ?
he should have left the country if and when he 's so unhappy at the way it 's governed .
in my opinion he deserves what he 's got , perhaps he will make himself useful while serving his sentence ?
i do believe , however , that he will be pardoned one day .
and in a larger picture , i hope , a lesson is learned -lrb- or is it not ? -rrb- and the point is made .
and to those ignorant few the thai king has worked extremely hard throughout his life for his own people and the land , and in so doing he has earned the highest respect and love from his own people .
he is our father .
i now wish to ask how do you treat your own selfless father ?
and how would you feel & react when someone tries to knock him down ?
suraphee simpson , surbiton , surrey , england draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures marc , london bbc news website reader when i lived in thai refugee camps in the 80s , we were not allowed to mess with thai baht which have the king 's pictures or emblem on them .
refugees were beaten up every day just because their lack of respect for the thai king .
even when the thai national anthem is playing , no matter where you are or what you do , you must stand still and straight .
if thailand means the land of the free , then it should reconsider it name .
s. ley , santa ana , us i 'm a filipino living in japan for the last 6 years and have met many thai nationals , and i can say that they truly have a deep respect for their king .
for those who criticize the thai monarch for being pompous or having a temper , i would like to say that the king does not charge anyone with " lese majeste " -lrb- and if i 'm not mistaken , has never had , at least in contemporary thailand -rrb- ; it 's the police that does .
there are cases wherein the said law was indeed abused -lrb- i.e. when politicians accuse their rivals -rrb- , but in the case of mr. jufer , his actions are similar to flag-burning / defacing of national symbols and should be punished , although i would agree that the sentence is draconian indeed .
christian ernest , oita , japan everyone in thailand knows the respect that the royal family , and in particular the king , are held in .
of course one should do what is expected of you in a different country and culture .
having said that the law regarding the thai monarchy serves no one but the powerful - who have managed to hide behind it for their political advantage before -lrb- example thaksin expelling critical foreign journalists on the grounds they insulted the monarchy -rrb- .
this rule does thailand no favours , laws are not needed for the king to be respected -lrb- he has it already -rrb- , social mores are enough to ensure respect is given - it only shows thailand in a poor way to the international community .
tim , seoul korea given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better .
i agree with derek from canada .
the rule is simple : respect the rules of the country you are in , otherwise stay home .
yas , malta the guy has absolutely no excuse .
as foreigners in this country we are all well aware of thais ' respect for their monarch .
they and most foreigners still stand for the national anthem in the cinema before a film .
i am sorry but it 's values like this that form a national identity and give a people pride .
what would happen if you played the national anthem before a film in the uk ?
also the offender will have been well aware in advance that he would be unable to buy alcohol on this day and should have done like all sensible foreigners here and had a supply at home .
paul , pattaya thailand although the court ruling of ten years is very severe , the point in fact is that oliver jufer was disrespectful and vandalous .
he not only went on a rampage of vandalism throughout the city of chang mai but also chose to degrade symbols of the very core of society in the country that was hosting him .
if we had strict such punishment and reverence for our cultural symbols there might be a lot less vandalism in our communities as well .
respect for property and cultural symbols is innate to any nation and this man deliberately went contrary to the respect of that land .
he deserves to be punished .
antonio , tokyo , japan folks need to remember that yes , as draconian and exaggerated as the sentence may appear ... this law is not imposed or even necessarily acknowledged by the king , but is enforced more so by all his subjects who see him as someone who very genuinely holds his people to heart and see him as the one pivotal figure of stability in a country with a history fraught with political instability and corruption and just as any of you might feel angered , even vengeful perhaps at someone demonstrating total , uncalled for disrespect to your immediate family members , so do the thai people feel protective of their king whom they lovingly refer to as father. long term expat resident in thailand , bangkok i find this ridiculous ...
in the 21st century today , people can even freely criticise or insult the gods - who does the thai king think he is ?
god ? or superior than gods ?
outrageous !
people should boycott travel industry in thailand .
such country is a horrified country , every single tourist in there must be cautioned over the unstable politics and their " sacred " king ... who knows maybe some day a single wrong saying about their king there can cost your fortune and life .
wake up , it 's the 21st century not the feudal era .
everyone is an equal individual , we do n't need anyone superior over us .
x , uk having lived in parts of asia for years , i kinda get the whole respects for monarchy thing - its not about respecting a terrifying institution , but about respecting an institution that symbolises a nation and a people , in a way .
if individuals in parts of the ' free ' west can be charged under law for burning the flag of certain nations , what difference defacing a poster depicting a symbol of another ?
if this guy had been simply an ignorant tourist , then he would n't know better , but he had lived in the country for 10 years .
though i hope he is pardoned , i understand why a nation that has made him welcome for such a time might not feel inclined to let him off lightly. penny , glasgow , scotland yet another travesty of thai " justice " .
this says far more about thailand than it does about oliver jufer ; draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures .
marc , london if king bhumibol can truly call himself as such then he should step in and pardon oliver jufer .
richard , london , uk no one brings anything into the world at birth , no one will take anything out of it at death .
everybody , including monarchs , should bear that in mind. wilhelm mistiaen , antwerp , belgium while we enjoy the privilege of international travel , especially to places in asia , we are made aware of , and therefore must abide by , all national and international laws .
many foreigners travelling through such countries seem to think that they are above these laws and that they only apply to the " locals " and that their respective embassies will step up and get them out of trouble .
it 's simple , respect the laws of the countries that let you in .
derek junor , toronto , canada the countries you mentioned are just the tip of the ice-berg .
regimes which need these repressive laws to avoid accountability and shut down public debate are the real traitors .
adrian , melbourne , australia for murdoch in prague : it seems clear from your comments that you understand nothing of respectability , opinions , laws or customs of other countries .
i do wonder what kind of upbringing you were subjected to that you can not see the man was wrong in insulting and not respecting his majesty the king .
furthermore , i do not believe his majesty sees westerners as threats .
the whole issue fundamentally lies with respecting one 's culture , which the west seems to have forgotten how to .
any patriots would understand that .
if you are one , and find your country insulted , i doubt you would write what you , sadly , have written .
respectfully yours , m in oxford .
m , oxford honestly , i find this rather comic and cruel at the same time , on one side you have a drunk and on the other , a king , who in my opinion , must have an explosive temper and turn purple at the mere idea of him being put down .
yes it may be against the law to do so , yet if all of a sudden the king says that he feels that anyone from the west is a threat and should be kicked out to maintain his ego , is that right ?
no , and all this is is one person poking fun at the king .
it poses no threat to the king at all .
so why freak out over an insult ?
now this may sound harsh but why not just quit being self-saturated and care for your people for they are the ones keeping your country alive , it 's not all you sir .
murdoch , prague .
czech republic it is appalling that such extreme laws still exist .
the king of thailand may be loved by his people , but since it is illegal to report anything but good news , they can not possibly know what he is really like .
maybe he is as wonderful as they think , but maybe not .
these draconian laws do not help the monarchy , except to stifle and control any opposition .
i think they are used to stop ordinary thai people learning the truth about how their country is run behind the scenes and by whom .
mary aquila , stockholm , sweden i think it was just a rude act , and an apology should suffice .
personally , i believe it is most insulting to other human to consider oneself a king or queen .
are n't we all created equal ?
jamila thomas , usa / kwt sorry , i am chinese , but i still find this ridiculous .
i know in the ancient asian couture , these kind of acts are very serious crimes .
not just asia , but i guess everywhere of the world .
however , in modern world ?
no way .
do n't claim this asian culture , maybe it 's a thai culture , but it 's not an asian culture , it 's a feudal and out of date practice .
in modern asian societies , we do n't think this " lese majeste " act is any good thing and can represent asian culture .
never !
ps , i criticise our chinese communist leaders and their policies everyday , even the former chairman mao .
ming , china in the far east , we respect our monarchs not only as part of our culture , but even to the extend of our beliefs -lrb- divine majesty -rrb- sometimes .
as such the view of lese majeste is somewhat more serious compared to the " openness " of western culture .
you say , when in rome , do as the romans .
i say , when in asia , do as the asians , please .
t.chunlakorn , thailand i 've lived in thailand for the past five years .
the guy should have known better .
there 's no excuse .
but for " p. kamao " from kenya , saying that it 's normal for westerners not to have any respect , is a foolish and contradictory statement .
i 've been to africa as an ngo and i 've seen the respect that your " elders " have given to the people .
and it was n't pretty .
and i 've lived in asia long enough to realize there is no respect in driving .
this was simply someone making a stupid decision .
you have to remember there are thousands of other westerners living in countries like thailand who are respectful .
t. johnson , bangkok , thailand you know , it may seem outrageous from the western perspective !
but western people should know that respect is very important in most cultures and societies especially in asia and africa .
i think the swiss man is paying for his bad bringing up ! perhaps he grew up without any sense of respect for anybody including his elders , the trend of which is so familiar and normal in western children and adults .

thailand is not the only state to prosecute those who offend their head of state , though few such laws are as draconian .
its law carries a maximum prison sentence of 75 years .
one step beyond - henry viii equated lese majeste with treason the concept of " lese-majeste " -lrb- literally , injury to the majesty -rrb- as a crime goes back to ancient rome and was jealously guarded by absolute monarchs in medieval europe , while something similar existed in asian cultures .
in brunei , which like thailand is ruled by a monarchy , three men were jailed for a year in 2006 for sending mobile phone clips judged seditious and insulting to sultan hassanal bolkiah and his family .
laws protecting the " dignity " of a monarch have been borrowed by many modern republics .
in the indian ocean state of the maldives , three journalists were sentenced to life in 2002 for " insulting the president " and setting up a newsletter critical of the government .
in poland , a member of the european union , you can technically get up to three years for offending the president .
given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better yas , malta bbc news website reader that protection is extended to any foreign head of state visiting the country .
thus police arrested 28 demonstrators in 2005 who were protesting against president vladimir putin of russia , a country which has not enjoyed good relations with its western neighbour at the best of times .
the chief concern about insult laws among human rights campaigners is that they can be used to stifle freedom of expression .
a basic right " freedom of speech is one of the most basic human rights , " a spokesperson for amnesty international told the bbc news website .
egypt jailed blogger abdel kareem soliman for insulting its leader " no state should be prosecuting any individual for expressing an opinion held peacefully . "
amnesty is not quibbling with laws on defamation or incitement which , it says , rightfully exist in any state to protect individuals and the community .
but other than these recognised limits on freedom of speech , there should be no restrictions , it argues .
republics which have prosecuted people for insulting their heads of state in recent years are typified by authoritarian leaders an egyptian court sentenced blogger abdel kareem soliman in february to four years in prison for insulting islam and president hosni mubarak kazakhstan gave journalist kaziz toguzbayev a two-year suspended sentence in january for " insulting the honour and dignity " of president nursultan nazarbayev zimbabwe gave a two-year suspended sentence to businessman jason gambitzs in 2004 for denigrating president robert mugabe by saying he had " printed useless money " belarus sentenced two opposition figures , valeriy levonevskiy and alexander vasiliev , in 2004 for publicly insulting president alexander lukashenko syria sentenced journalist mohammad ghanem to six months in prison in 2006 for charges which included insulting president bashar al-assad access to the popular video-sharing website youtube was suspended in turkey this month after prosecutors told a court that clips had appeared on the site insulting national hero mustafa kemal ataturk - who has been dead for nearly 70 years .
rebellious or rude ?
freedom of speech was not , strictly speaking , at issue in thailand 's prosecution of oliver jufer , who admitted spray-painting several portraits of the king while drunk .
many in thailand see king bhumibol as an anchor of stability " it was the idea that being rude about a government was a very bad idea - it hurt the government but was technically not treason because no act of rebellion was committed , " prof ronald hutton of bristol university told the bbc news website .
" in the days before the idea of constitutional opposition , any opposition was regarded as criminal and anybody who spoke against the government had to be prosecuted because it could incite rebellion . "
if the concept now sounds obscure in that other leading contemporary monarchy britain , it is thanks to king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- , who took personal injury one step further .
" traditionally you have a division in countries between acts against the monarch which are treason and rude things said against the monarch which are ' lese-majeste ' , " prof hutton explains .
" but henry viii passed an act which made speaking against the king treason in itself so ' lese-majeste ' became redundant . "
before anyone gets unduly anxious about offending queen elizabeth ii , it should be pointed out that british parliamentarians dealt with that part of henry 's act long ago .
since the 1790s , prof hutton points out , britain has had freedom of speech legislation which covers most of what was once " treason-by-words " .
your comments well ... if you are walking down the street in london facing massive queen 's portraits on every corner , pretty sure you will be intimidated or annoyed .
j.woo , uk " when in rome , do as the romans .
when in asia , do as the asians , please . "
but what if the roman or asian way is against the basic right of human beings , then what ? unnamed reader this is truly shocking .
respect is earned , not ordained .
i respect the thai people .
they have to live and work under such capricious and vile laws .
i have zero respect for their king that does n't rationally find such laws inhumane ...
he 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .

thailand is not the only state to prosecute those who offend their head of state , though few such laws are as draconian .
its law carries a maximum prison sentence of 75 years .
one step beyond - henry viii equated lese majeste with treason the concept of " lese-majeste " -lrb- literally , injury to the majesty -rrb- as a crime goes back to ancient rome and was jealously guarded by absolute monarchs in medieval europe , while something similar existed in asian cultures .
in brunei , which like thailand is ruled by a monarchy , three men were jailed for a year in 2006 for sending mobile phone clips judged seditious and insulting to sultan hassanal bolkiah and his family .
laws protecting the " dignity " of a monarch have been borrowed by many modern republics .
in the indian ocean state of the maldives , three journalists were sentenced to life in 2002 for " insulting the president " and setting up a newsletter critical of the government .
in poland , a member of the european union , you can technically get up to three years for offending the president .
given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better yas , malta bbc news website reader that protection is extended to any foreign head of state visiting the country .
thus police arrested 28 demonstrators in 2005 who were protesting against president vladimir putin of russia , a country which has not enjoyed good relations with its western neighbour at the best of times .
the chief concern about insult laws among human rights campaigners is that they can be used to stifle freedom of expression .
a basic right " freedom of speech is one of the most basic human rights , " a spokesperson for amnesty international told the bbc news website .
egypt jailed blogger abdel kareem soliman for insulting its leader " no state should be prosecuting any individual for expressing an opinion held peacefully . "
amnesty is not quibbling with laws on defamation or incitement which , it says , rightfully exist in any state to protect individuals and the community .
but other than these recognised limits on freedom of speech , there should be no restrictions , it argues .
republics which have prosecuted people for insulting their heads of state in recent years are typified by authoritarian leaders an egyptian court sentenced blogger abdel kareem soliman in february to four years in prison for insulting islam and president hosni mubarak kazakhstan gave journalist kaziz toguzbayev a two-year suspended sentence in january for " insulting the honour and dignity " of president nursultan nazarbayev zimbabwe gave a two-year suspended sentence to businessman jason gambitzs in 2004 for denigrating president robert mugabe by saying he had " printed useless money " belarus sentenced two opposition figures , valeriy levonevskiy and alexander vasiliev , in 2004 for publicly insulting president alexander lukashenko syria sentenced journalist mohammad ghanem to six months in prison in 2006 for charges which included insulting president bashar al-assad access to the popular video-sharing website youtube was suspended in turkey this month after prosecutors told a court that clips had appeared on the site insulting national hero mustafa kemal ataturk - who has been dead for nearly 70 years .
rebellious or rude ?
freedom of speech was not , strictly speaking , at issue in thailand 's prosecution of oliver jufer , who admitted spray-painting several portraits of the king while drunk .
many in thailand see king bhumibol as an anchor of stability " it was the idea that being rude about a government was a very bad idea - it hurt the government but was technically not treason because no act of rebellion was committed , " prof ronald hutton of bristol university told the bbc news website .
" in the days before the idea of constitutional opposition , any opposition was regarded as criminal and anybody who spoke against the government had to be prosecuted because it could incite rebellion . "
if the concept now sounds obscure in that other leading contemporary monarchy britain , it is thanks to king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- , who took personal injury one step further .
" traditionally you have a division in countries between acts against the monarch which are treason and rude things said against the monarch which are ' lese-majeste ' , " prof hutton explains .
" but henry viii passed an act which made speaking against the king treason in itself so ' lese-majeste ' became redundant . "
before anyone gets unduly anxious about offending queen elizabeth ii , it should be pointed out that british parliamentarians dealt with that part of henry 's act long ago .
since the 1790s , prof hutton points out , britain has had freedom of speech legislation which covers most of what was once " treason-by-words " .
your comments well ... if you are walking down the street in london facing massive queen 's portraits on every corner , pretty sure you will be intimidated or annoyed .
j.woo , uk " when in rome , do as the romans .
when in asia , do as the asians , please . "
but what if the roman or asian way is against the basic right of human beings , then what ? unnamed reader this is truly shocking .
respect is earned , not ordained .
i respect the thai people .
they have to live and work under such capricious and vile laws .
i have zero respect for their king that does n't rationally find such laws inhumane ...
he 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .
us " westerners " may not be the beacons of honour and morality to most of you , certainly my country 's leadership is lacking beyond imaging , but i am proud they 're thick-skinned enough not to be disassembled by mere insults .
how fragile thailand 's monarchy must be if they fear the act of a drunkard ...
i question the upbringing of some of you that support this garbage .
any of those that suggest to blindly follow authority have clearly lost some capability ... called thinking .
if you defend such onerous nonsense , you should be jailed along with the drunk , for supporting such dangerous laws of repression that clearly is a danger to all of thailand ...
from the country that can take its punches and give some back .
peace .
ernesto , washington dc being a thai living in many countries abroad longer than in thailand i find some opinions on the issue most interesting while others to be downright pitiful .
when one travels the world one can not just hold on to one 's own supreme standard but adjust and adapt as one goes along - to make the most of what are on offer and to one 's own benefits and enjoyment .
the swiss has lived for a decade in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with a mild climate , well-mannered gentle people and great choices of food , and at a fraction of what he would have to pay in switzerland .
one day he got drunk and did what not only goes against the law but is also the most offensive act to the thais .
is this not the case of taking out of the land more than he put in ?
he should have left the country if and when he 's so unhappy at the way it 's governed .
in my opinion he deserves what he 's got , perhaps he will make himself useful while serving his sentence ?
i do believe , however , that he will be pardoned one day .
and in a larger picture , i hope , a lesson is learned -lrb- or is it not ? -rrb- and the point is made .
and to those ignorant few the thai king has worked extremely hard throughout his life for his own people and the land , and in so doing he has earned the highest respect and love from his own people .
he is our father .
i now wish to ask how do you treat your own selfless father ?
and how would you feel & react when someone tries to knock him down ?
suraphee simpson , surbiton , surrey , england draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures marc , london bbc news website reader when i lived in thai refugee camps in the 80s , we were not allowed to mess with thai baht which have the king 's pictures or emblem on them .
refugees were beaten up every day just because their lack of respect for the thai king .
even when the thai national anthem is playing , no matter where you are or what you do , you must stand still and straight .
if thailand means the land of the free , then it should reconsider it name .
s. ley , santa ana , us i 'm a filipino living in japan for the last 6 years and have met many thai nationals , and i can say that they truly have a deep respect for their king .
for those who criticize the thai monarch for being pompous or having a temper , i would like to say that the king does not charge anyone with " lese majeste " -lrb- and if i 'm not mistaken , has never had , at least in contemporary thailand -rrb- ; it 's the police that does .
there are cases wherein the said law was indeed abused -lrb- i.e. when politicians accuse their rivals -rrb- , but in the case of mr. jufer , his actions are similar to flag-burning / defacing of national symbols and should be punished , although i would agree that the sentence is draconian indeed .
christian ernest , oita , japan everyone in thailand knows the respect that the royal family , and in particular the king , are held in .
of course one should do what is expected of you in a different country and culture .
having said that the law regarding the thai monarchy serves no one but the powerful - who have managed to hide behind it for their political advantage before -lrb- example thaksin expelling critical foreign journalists on the grounds they insulted the monarchy -rrb- .
this rule does thailand no favours , laws are not needed for the king to be respected -lrb- he has it already -rrb- , social mores are enough to ensure respect is given - it only shows thailand in a poor way to the international community .
tim , seoul korea given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better .
i agree with derek from canada .
the rule is simple : respect the rules of the country you are in , otherwise stay home .
yas , malta the guy has absolutely no excuse .
as foreigners in this country we are all well aware of thais ' respect for their monarch .
they and most foreigners still stand for the national anthem in the cinema before a film .
i am sorry but it 's values like this that form a national identity and give a people pride .
what would happen if you played the national anthem before a film in the uk ?
also the offender will have been well aware in advance that he would be unable to buy alcohol on this day and should have done like all sensible foreigners here and had a supply at home .
paul , pattaya thailand although the court ruling of ten years is very severe , the point in fact is that oliver jufer was disrespectful and vandalous .
he not only went on a rampage of vandalism throughout the city of chang mai but also chose to degrade symbols of the very core of society in the country that was hosting him .
if we had strict such punishment and reverence for our cultural symbols there might be a lot less vandalism in our communities as well .
respect for property and cultural symbols is innate to any nation and this man deliberately went contrary to the respect of that land .
he deserves to be punished .
antonio , tokyo , japan folks need to remember that yes , as draconian and exaggerated as the sentence may appear ... this law is not imposed or even necessarily acknowledged by the king , but is enforced more so by all his subjects who see him as someone who very genuinely holds his people to heart and see him as the one pivotal figure of stability in a country with a history fraught with political instability and corruption and just as any of you might feel angered , even vengeful perhaps at someone demonstrating total , uncalled for disrespect to your immediate family members , so do the thai people feel protective of their king whom they lovingly refer to as father. long term expat resident in thailand , bangkok i find this ridiculous ...
in the 21st century today , people can even freely criticise or insult the gods - who does the thai king think he is ?
god ? or superior than gods ?
outrageous !
people should boycott travel industry in thailand .
such country is a horrified country , every single tourist in there must be cautioned over the unstable politics and their " sacred " king ... who knows maybe some day a single wrong saying about their king there can cost your fortune and life .
wake up , it 's the 21st century not the feudal era .
everyone is an equal individual , we do n't need anyone superior over us .
x , uk having lived in parts of asia for years , i kinda get the whole respects for monarchy thing - its not about respecting a terrifying institution , but about respecting an institution that symbolises a nation and a people , in a way .
if individuals in parts of the ' free ' west can be charged under law for burning the flag of certain nations , what difference defacing a poster depicting a symbol of another ?
if this guy had been simply an ignorant tourist , then he would n't know better , but he had lived in the country for 10 years .
though i hope he is pardoned , i understand why a nation that has made him welcome for such a time might not feel inclined to let him off lightly. penny , glasgow , scotland yet another travesty of thai " justice " .
this says far more about thailand than it does about oliver jufer ; draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures .
marc , london if king bhumibol can truly call himself as such then he should step in and pardon oliver jufer .
richard , london , uk no one brings anything into the world at birth , no one will take anything out of it at death .
everybody , including monarchs , should bear that in mind. wilhelm mistiaen , antwerp , belgium while we enjoy the privilege of international travel , especially to places in asia , we are made aware of , and therefore must abide by , all national and international laws .
many foreigners travelling through such countries seem to think that they are above these laws and that they only apply to the " locals " and that their respective embassies will step up and get them out of trouble .
it 's simple , respect the laws of the countries that let you in .
derek junor , toronto , canada the countries you mentioned are just the tip of the ice-berg .
regimes which need these repressive laws to avoid accountability and shut down public debate are the real traitors .
adrian , melbourne , australia for murdoch in prague : it seems clear from your comments that you understand nothing of respectability , opinions , laws or customs of other countries .
i do wonder what kind of upbringing you were subjected to that you can not see the man was wrong in insulting and not respecting his majesty the king .
furthermore , i do not believe his majesty sees westerners as threats .
the whole issue fundamentally lies with respecting one 's culture , which the west seems to have forgotten how to .
any patriots would understand that .
if you are one , and find your country insulted , i doubt you would write what you , sadly , have written .
respectfully yours , m in oxford .
m , oxford honestly , i find this rather comic and cruel at the same time , on one side you have a drunk and on the other , a king , who in my opinion , must have an explosive temper and turn purple at the mere idea of him being put down .
yes it may be against the law to do so , yet if all of a sudden the king says that he feels that anyone from the west is a threat and should be kicked out to maintain his ego , is that right ?
no , and all this is is one person poking fun at the king .
it poses no threat to the king at all .
so why freak out over an insult ?
now this may sound harsh but why not just quit being self-saturated and care for your people for they are the ones keeping your country alive , it 's not all you sir .
murdoch , prague .
czech republic it is appalling that such extreme laws still exist .
the king of thailand may be loved by his people , but since it is illegal to report anything but good news , they can not possibly know what he is really like .
maybe he is as wonderful as they think , but maybe not .
these draconian laws do not help the monarchy , except to stifle and control any opposition .
i think they are used to stop ordinary thai people learning the truth about how their country is run behind the scenes and by whom .
mary aquila , stockholm , sweden i think it was just a rude act , and an apology should suffice .
personally , i believe it is most insulting to other human to consider oneself a king or queen .
are n't we all created equal ?
jamila thomas , usa / kwt sorry , i am chinese , but i still find this ridiculous .
i know in the ancient asian couture , these kind of acts are very serious crimes .
not just asia , but i guess everywhere of the world .
however , in modern world ?
no way .
do n't claim this asian culture , maybe it 's a thai culture , but it 's not an asian culture , it 's a feudal and out of date practice .
in modern asian societies , we do n't think this " lese majeste " act is any good thing and can represent asian culture .
never !
ps , i criticise our chinese communist leaders and their policies everyday , even the former chairman mao .
ming , china in the far east , we respect our monarchs not only as part of our culture , but even to the extend of our beliefs -lrb- divine majesty -rrb- sometimes .
as such the view of lese majeste is somewhat more serious compared to the " openness " of western culture .
you say , when in rome , do as the romans .
i say , when in asia , do as the asians , please .
t.chunlakorn , thailand i 've lived in thailand for the past five years .
the guy should have known better .
there 's no excuse .
but for " p. kamao " from kenya , saying that it 's normal for westerners not to have any respect , is a foolish and contradictory statement .

suraphee simpson , surbiton , surrey , england draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures marc , london bbc news website reader when i lived in thai refugee camps in the 80s , we were not allowed to mess with thai baht which have the king 's pictures or emblem on them .
refugees were beaten up every day just because their lack of respect for the thai king .
even when the thai national anthem is playing , no matter where you are or what you do , you must stand still and straight .
if thailand means the land of the free , then it should reconsider it name .
s. ley , santa ana , us i 'm a filipino living in japan for the last 6 years and have met many thai nationals , and i can say that they truly have a deep respect for their king .
for those who criticize the thai monarch for being pompous or having a temper , i would like to say that the king does not charge anyone with " lese majeste " -lrb- and if i 'm not mistaken , has never had , at least in contemporary thailand -rrb- ; it 's the police that does .
there are cases wherein the said law was indeed abused -lrb- i.e. when politicians accuse their rivals -rrb- , but in the case of mr. jufer , his actions are similar to flag-burning / defacing of national symbols and should be punished , although i would agree that the sentence is draconian indeed .
christian ernest , oita , japan everyone in thailand knows the respect that the royal family , and in particular the king , are held in .
of course one should do what is expected of you in a different country and culture .
having said that the law regarding the thai monarchy serves no one but the powerful - who have managed to hide behind it for their political advantage before -lrb- example thaksin expelling critical foreign journalists on the grounds they insulted the monarchy -rrb- .
this rule does thailand no favours , laws are not needed for the king to be respected -lrb- he has it already -rrb- , social mores are enough to ensure respect is given - it only shows thailand in a poor way to the international community .
tim , seoul korea given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better .
i agree with derek from canada .
the rule is simple : respect the rules of the country you are in , otherwise stay home .
yas , malta the guy has absolutely no excuse .
as foreigners in this country we are all well aware of thais ' respect for their monarch .
they and most foreigners still stand for the national anthem in the cinema before a film .
i am sorry but it 's values like this that form a national identity and give a people pride .
what would happen if you played the national anthem before a film in the uk ?
also the offender will have been well aware in advance that he would be unable to buy alcohol on this day and should have done like all sensible foreigners here and had a supply at home .
paul , pattaya thailand although the court ruling of ten years is very severe , the point in fact is that oliver jufer was disrespectful and vandalous .
he not only went on a rampage of vandalism throughout the city of chang mai but also chose to degrade symbols of the very core of society in the country that was hosting him .
if we had strict such punishment and reverence for our cultural symbols there might be a lot less vandalism in our communities as well .
respect for property and cultural symbols is innate to any nation and this man deliberately went contrary to the respect of that land .
he deserves to be punished .
antonio , tokyo , japan folks need to remember that yes , as draconian and exaggerated as the sentence may appear ... this law is not imposed or even necessarily acknowledged by the king , but is enforced more so by all his subjects who see him as someone who very genuinely holds his people to heart and see him as the one pivotal figure of stability in a country with a history fraught with political instability and corruption and just as any of you might feel angered , even vengeful perhaps at someone demonstrating total , uncalled for disrespect to your immediate family members , so do the thai people feel protective of their king whom they lovingly refer to as father. long term expat resident in thailand , bangkok i find this ridiculous ...
in the 21st century today , people can even freely criticise or insult the gods - who does the thai king think he is ?
god ? or superior than gods ?
outrageous !
people should boycott travel industry in thailand .
such country is a horrified country , every single tourist in there must be cautioned over the unstable politics and their " sacred " king ... who knows maybe some day a single wrong saying about their king there can cost your fortune and life .
wake up , it 's the 21st century not the feudal era .
everyone is an equal individual , we do n't need anyone superior over us .
x , uk having lived in parts of asia for years , i kinda get the whole respects for monarchy thing - its not about respecting a terrifying institution , but about respecting an institution that symbolises a nation and a people , in a way .
if individuals in parts of the ' free ' west can be charged under law for burning the flag of certain nations , what difference defacing a poster depicting a symbol of another ?
if this guy had been simply an ignorant tourist , then he would n't know better , but he had lived in the country for 10 years .
though i hope he is pardoned , i understand why a nation that has made him welcome for such a time might not feel inclined to let him off lightly. penny , glasgow , scotland yet another travesty of thai " justice " .
this says far more about thailand than it does about oliver jufer ; draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between western and eastern cultures .

no , and all this is is one person poking fun at the king .
it poses no threat to the king at all .

thailand is not the only state to prosecute those who offend their head of state , though few such laws are as draconian .
its law carries a maximum prison sentence of 75 years .
one step beyond - henry viii equated lese majeste with treason the concept of " lese-majeste " -lrb- literally , injury to the majesty -rrb- as a crime goes back to ancient rome and was jealously guarded by absolute monarchs in medieval europe , while something similar existed in asian cultures .
in brunei , which like thailand is ruled by a monarchy , three men were jailed for a year in 2006 for sending mobile phone clips judged seditious and insulting to sultan hassanal bolkiah and his family .
laws protecting the " dignity " of a monarch have been borrowed by many modern republics .
in the indian ocean state of the maldives , three journalists were sentenced to life in 2002 for " insulting the president " and setting up a newsletter critical of the government .
in poland , a member of the european union , you can technically get up to three years for offending the president .
given that mr jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better yas , malta bbc news website reader that protection is extended to any foreign head of state visiting the country .
thus police arrested 28 demonstrators in 2005 who were protesting against president vladimir putin of russia , a country which has not enjoyed good relations with its western neighbour at the best of times .
the chief concern about insult laws among human rights campaigners is that they can be used to stifle freedom of expression .
a basic right " freedom of speech is one of the most basic human rights , " a spokesperson for amnesty international told the bbc news website .
egypt jailed blogger abdel kareem soliman for insulting its leader " no state should be prosecuting any individual for expressing an opinion held peacefully . "
amnesty is not quibbling with laws on defamation or incitement which , it says , rightfully exist in any state to protect individuals and the community .
but other than these recognised limits on freedom of speech , there should be no restrictions , it argues .
republics which have prosecuted people for insulting their heads of state in recent years are typified by authoritarian leaders an egyptian court sentenced blogger abdel kareem soliman in february to four years in prison for insulting islam and president hosni mubarak kazakhstan gave journalist kaziz toguzbayev a two-year suspended sentence in january for " insulting the honour and dignity " of president nursultan nazarbayev zimbabwe gave a two-year suspended sentence to businessman jason gambitzs in 2004 for denigrating president robert mugabe by saying he had " printed useless money " belarus sentenced two opposition figures , valeriy levonevskiy and alexander vasiliev , in 2004 for publicly insulting president alexander lukashenko syria sentenced journalist mohammad ghanem to six months in prison in 2006 for charges which included insulting president bashar al-assad access to the popular video-sharing website youtube was suspended in turkey this month after prosecutors told a court that clips had appeared on the site insulting national hero mustafa kemal ataturk - who has been dead for nearly 70 years .
rebellious or rude ?
freedom of speech was not , strictly speaking , at issue in thailand 's prosecution of oliver jufer , who admitted spray-painting several portraits of the king while drunk .
many in thailand see king bhumibol as an anchor of stability " it was the idea that being rude about a government was a very bad idea - it hurt the government but was technically not treason because no act of rebellion was committed , " prof ronald hutton of bristol university told the bbc news website .
" in the days before the idea of constitutional opposition , any opposition was regarded as criminal and anybody who spoke against the government had to be prosecuted because it could incite rebellion . "
if the concept now sounds obscure in that other leading contemporary monarchy britain , it is thanks to king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- , who took personal injury one step further .
" traditionally you have a division in countries between acts against the monarch which are treason and rude things said against the monarch which are ' lese-majeste ' , " prof hutton explains .
" but henry viii passed an act which made speaking against the king treason in itself so ' lese-majeste ' became redundant . "
before anyone gets unduly anxious about offending queen elizabeth ii , it should be pointed out that british parliamentarians dealt with that part of henry 's act long ago .
since the 1790s , prof hutton points out , britain has had freedom of speech legislation which covers most of what was once " treason-by-words " .
your comments well ... if you are walking down the street in london facing massive queen 's portraits on every corner , pretty sure you will be intimidated or annoyed .
j.woo , uk " when in rome , do as the romans .
when in asia , do as the asians , please . "
but what if the roman or asian way is against the basic right of human beings , then what ? unnamed reader this is truly shocking .
respect is earned , not ordained .
i respect the thai people .
they have to live and work under such capricious and vile laws .
i have zero respect for their king that does n't rationally find such laws inhumane ...
he 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .
us " westerners " may not be the beacons of honour and morality to most of you , certainly my country 's leadership is lacking beyond imaging , but i am proud they 're thick-skinned enough not to be disassembled by mere insults .
how fragile thailand 's monarchy must be if they fear the act of a drunkard ...
i question the upbringing of some of you that support this garbage .
any of those that suggest to blindly follow authority have clearly lost some capability ... called thinking .
if you defend such onerous nonsense , you should be jailed along with the drunk , for supporting such dangerous laws of repression that clearly is a danger to all of thailand ...
from the country that can take its punches and give some back .
peace .
ernesto , washington dc being a thai living in many countries abroad longer than in thailand i find some opinions on the issue most interesting while others to be downright pitiful .
when one travels the world one can not just hold on to one 's own supreme standard but adjust and adapt as one goes along - to make the most of what are on offer and to one 's own benefits and enjoyment .
the swiss has lived for a decade in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with a mild climate , well-mannered gentle people and great choices of food , and at a fraction of what he would have to pay in switzerland .
one day he got drunk and did what not only goes against the law but is also the most offensive act to the thais .
is this not the case of taking out of the land more than he put in ?
he should have left the country if and when he 's so unhappy at the way it 's governed .
in my opinion he deserves what he 's got , perhaps he will make himself useful while serving his sentence ?
i do believe , however , that he will be pardoned one day .
and in a larger picture , i hope , a lesson is learned -lrb- or is it not ? -rrb- and the point is made .
and to those ignorant few the thai king has worked extremely hard throughout his life for his own people and the land , and in so doing he has earned the highest respect and love from his own people .
he is our father .
i now wish to ask how do you treat your own selfless father ?
and how would you feel & react when someone tries to knock him down ?

doubts were raised over the safety of the vaccine after dr andrew wakefield claimed he had found a link between it and autism .
his research , first published in 1998 , has since been widely discredited .
the medical research council in glasgow said the controversy put parents of autistic children under great pressure .
' agonising uncertainty ' during the early years of the decade concern about a possible link with the triple vaccine for measles , mumps and rubella was at its height and the number of children being vaccinated fell from 94 % to 87 % .
research led by dr wakefield claimed the jab was linked to autism , but much larger studies have since ruled this out .
the mrc 's social and public health sciences unit undertook 10 focus group discussions across the uk between 2003 and 2005 involving 38 parents of children with autism .
dr shona hilton and her colleagues found that some parents had experienced " agonising uncertainty " over whether the mmr vaccine may have provoked their child 's autism .
these parents in particular have been under a huge amount of stress about the possible impact of their decision to vaccinate or not dr shona hilton many wondered whether they were to blame for their child 's condition or felt they had " let their children down " by deciding to vaccinate .
even those who felt that their child 's autism was not linked to the mmr vaccine , either because of family history or because they had avoided vaccination , had suffered as a result of the ambiguous advice they felt that they had received .
dr hilton said : " it is clear from a review of the literature that there has been a lack of follow-up of the impact of this health scare on those likely to be most directly affected - those living day in and day out with children with autism .
" these parents in particular have been under a huge amount of stress about the possible impact of their decision to vaccinate or not . "

iberia said that tpg capital had made a bid approach and asked to look at the company 's books .
the offer values iberia at 3.6 euros per share , less than the current price on the madrid stock exchange .
an " open skies " deal between the us and europe is set to drive consolidation in the airline industry , analysts say .

the money from the department of health is awarded for exceeding national targets in responding to emergencies .
ambulance crews have to reach high priority cases - such as heart attack victims - within eight minutes , and category b cases in 19 minutes .
the region 's ambulances arrived at more than 68 % of these calls within the target time . "
to have achieved this is excellent " chairman chris faircliffe , east midlands ambulance service ambulance spokesman phil morris said the money would be used for a variety of projects including relocating the service 's control centre from beechdale road , nottingham to a business park in cinderhill .
the service was rated " weak " by the healthcare commission in october 2006 because it failed to hit targets in responding to non-urgent calls .
the service was getting to about 61 % of its calls in the target time at that point , but by march the level had reached 68.66 % - the best response rate in the country .
the service , which originally covered nottinghamshire , leicestershire , and derbyshire , was expanded last year to include northamptonshire and lincolnshire .
" to have achieved this is excellent , " board chairman chris faircliffe said .
ambulance trusts are expected to respond to 75 % of category a emergency calls within eight minutes by april 2008 .
