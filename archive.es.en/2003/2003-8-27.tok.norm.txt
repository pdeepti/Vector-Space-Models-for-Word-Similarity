a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2003 german companies get serious about iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the business of rebuilding the war-torn country is underway .
as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .

instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .

" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .
support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer -lrb- picture -rrb- said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .
with reports of continuing skirmishes from the volatile outlying regions of afghanistan , the move to kunduz is considered by some as too dangerous .
several german soldiers have already been killed during peacekeeping in kabul . significant contribution to isaf with 2,500 soldiers based in kabul , germans form the largest contingent of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul under u.n. mandate .

with veteran berlinale festival director , moritz de hadeln at the helm , the sixtieth venice film festival that kicks off wednesday promises to be a lively affair , brimming with sex , controversy and glamour . in his introduction to venice 's sixtieth birthday , de hadeln said that british director peter greenaway had proposed staging a conference in venice entitled ' cinema is dead ! ' , a declaration which he claims could n't be further from the truth .
" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .

the film , a mixture of history and melodrama , is the only german film in the running for a golden lion .
margarethe von trotta , possibly the best known woman director to emerge from the new german cinema , began her cinema career with heavyweights rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff , before going on to direct her own critically acclaimed feature films .
although rosenstrasse is her first cinema feature for almost a decade , she is no stranger to venice and the thrill of the chase for a golden lion .
in 1981 , she was awarded the coveted prize for her film die bleierne zeit -lrb- marianne and juliane -rrb- .

speaking to the financial times deutschland , a spokesman for monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on tuesday : " if a country that has determined it will have a budget deficit over 3 percent fails to take the necessary measures , then the commission will have to go to the next level . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2003 from kabul to kunduz : german peacekeepers in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping kabul safe - a german soldier in the afghan capital .
german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .
but they are unlikely to completely convince german lawmakers to extend the afghanistan mandate .
germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , struck underlined the significance of that argument .
" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " germans a key player in afghanistan with 2,500 soldiers based in kabul , germans form the largest contingent of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul under u.n. mandate .
germany together with the netherlands was in joint command of the force for the past six months till nato took over on august 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans , who hosted the first conference on afghanistan ’ s future after the ousting of the taliban last year , have played a key role in stabilizing the afghan capital , aiding reconstruction efforts and in training the local police and army . accordingly , the chances are good german troops will move to kunduz , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region . kunduz deployment too dangerous ? but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .
with reports of continuing skirmishes from the volatile outlying regions of afghanistan , the move to kunduz is considered by some as too dangerous .
several german soldiers have already been killed during peacekeeping in kabul . others believe schröder ’ s government simply want to score points with the united states by extending the afghanistan mandate , after a dramatic souring of relations in the wake of u.s. president bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq . bernhard gertz , head of the german armed forces association , said on monday the anti-terror fight in afghanistan should be intensified , but ruled out sending troops to kunduz .
he said just 7,000 german soldiers were deployed worldwide for the fight against terror that " only takes place sporadically . "
he stressed the security situation in afghanistan had " worsened dramatically " and added it made no sense to send more peacekeepers there under such conditions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid organizations criticize germany ’ s afghanistan plans military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .
but they are unlikely to completely convince german lawmakers to extend the afghanistan mandate .
germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , struck underlined the significance of that argument .
" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " germans a key player in afghanistan with 2,500 soldiers based in kabul , germans form the largest contingent of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul under u.n. mandate .

with reports of continuing skirmishes from the volatile outlying regions of afghanistan , the move to kunduz is considered by some as too dangerous .
several german soldiers have already been killed during peacekeeping in kabul . others believe schröder ’ s government simply want to score points with the united states by extending the afghanistan mandate , after a dramatic souring of relations in the wake of u.s. president bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq . bernhard gertz , head of the german armed forces association , said on monday the anti-terror fight in afghanistan should be intensified , but ruled out sending troops to kunduz .
he said just 7,000 german soldiers were deployed worldwide for the fight against terror that " only takes place sporadically . "

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

on wednesday at 10:51 utc , mars will officially be a ' mere ' 55.76 million kilometers -lrb- 34.65 million miles -rrb- from neighboring earth , which is closer than it has been since the time of the neanderthals .
the big red planet has been slowly moving in on earth for the past few months , and has been visible as a bright orange object in the night sky for many weeks already , outshining everything else in the firmament but the moon and venus .
with a clear sky and a small telescope , mars fans should be able to make out surface details of the planet , such as its southern ice cap . out of orbital sync the scarce nature of this neighborly visit is written in the stars .
like a racing track , the orbital paths of mars and earth run roughly alongside one another , with earth on the inner track on a more-or-less circular orbit and mars on a more elliptical path around the sun . as they are never quite in sync , earth overtakes the red planet once every two years and two months , and once in a blue moon they simultaneously hit the point in their tracks which are closest to one another . according to scientific calculations the last time the planets were actually so close was on september 12 in the year 57,617 before christ .
and although there have been other close encounters since between then and now , none have been quite so dramatic as this one . scientific advantage renowned for their astonishing ability to calculate and predict , scientists have been gearing up for this planetary brushing for some time .
earlier in the summer , nasa launched two new rovers for the exploration of the mysterious planet .
the identical rovers , which are due to land in two different locations on the planet in january 2004 , are equipped with a set of sophisticated instruments to help determine whether climatic conditions at the martian sites could once have been favorable enough to support life . the european space agency also launched a mars probe in the summer .
beagle 2 is due to land on mars some time in december , where it will begin an exploration of the planet 's atmosphere , surface and sub-surface , gathering information about the air with a gas-sniffing ' nose ' and about the physical make-up of the planet with samples from below the surface . endless fascination mars has long been a source of fascination for us earthlings .
since the first close-up pictures of the red planet in 1965 , spacecraft voyages have repeatedly revealed a world with strange and distant familiarities , which have keep scientists hooked and anxious to find out more . what they already know is that mars , like earth , has polar ice caps and clouds in its atmosphere , seasonal weather patterns , volcanoes , canyons and other recognizable features . and although they also know that conditions there are far colder and more sterile than those on our own highly-evolved planet , scientists are now certain that there are great lakes of ice trapped beneath the ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2003 german companies get serious about iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the business of rebuilding the war-torn country is underway .
as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .
as security in iraq slowly stabilizes , german companies will begin to take advantage of business opportunities with their former trading partners in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .
-lrb- july 17 , 2003 -rrb- european companies fear they 'll be left out in post-war iraq european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.08.2003 the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic 's regime kept thousands of secret police files on serbian citizens .
by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .
experts and politicians have largely agreed in principle to complete the disclosure and batic has presented the bill to parliament . ngos are claiming victory .
biljana kovacevic-vuco , head of the lawyers ' committee for human rights , is convinced that this is an important step towards the normalization of serbian society . " the disclosure of -lsb- secret service -rsb- files is the first step a state has to make if it wants to come to terms with darker parts of its past .
now the possibility for us to look our own past in the face is sitting there right in front of us , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic launches vigorous defence accused of genocide and war crimes , the former yugoslav president ridicules the un court as his lawless captor and launches a robust defence , aided by gory photographs of civilians killed by nato bombs .

" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .
experts and politicians have largely agreed in principle to complete the disclosure and batic has presented the bill to parliament . ngos are claiming victory .
biljana kovacevic-vuco , head of the lawyers ' committee for human rights , is convinced that this is an important step towards the normalization of serbian society . " the disclosure of -lsb- secret service -rsb- files is the first step a state has to make if it wants to come to terms with darker parts of its past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2003 storm brewing over the question of wind energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a sustainable energy source or just a glutton for subsidies ?
disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .
tourism industry groups have also come forward , saying the huge turbines will mar the seascape and could hurt their business . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climbing the windmills of schleswig-holstein extreme sports enthusiasts are always looking for the next thrill .

but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .

earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .
support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .

with veteran berlinale festival director , moritz de hadeln at the helm , the sixtieth venice film festival that kicks off wednesday promises to be a lively affair , brimming with sex , controversy and glamour . in his introduction to venice 's sixtieth birthday , de hadeln said that british director peter greenaway had proposed staging a conference in venice entitled ' cinema is dead ! ' , a declaration which he claims could n't be further from the truth .
" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .

the film , a mixture of history and melodrama , is the only german film in the running for a golden lion .
margarethe von trotta , possibly the best known woman director to emerge from the new german cinema , began her cinema career with heavyweights rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff , before going on to direct her own critically acclaimed feature films .
although rosenstrasse is her first cinema feature for almost a decade , she is no stranger to venice and the thrill of the chase for a golden lion .

" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2003 german companies get serious about iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the business of rebuilding the war-torn country is underway .
as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .
as security in iraq slowly stabilizes , german companies will begin to take advantage of business opportunities with their former trading partners in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .
but they are unlikely to completely convince german lawmakers to extend the afghanistan mandate .
germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , struck underlined the significance of that argument .
" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2003 storm brewing over the question of wind energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a sustainable energy source or just a glutton for subsidies ?
disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .
experts and politicians have largely agreed in principle to complete the disclosure and batic has presented the bill to parliament . ngos are claiming victory .
biljana kovacevic-vuco , head of the lawyers ' committee for human rights , is convinced that this is an important step towards the normalization of serbian society . " the disclosure of -lsb- secret service -rsb- files is the first step a state has to make if it wants to come to terms with darker parts of its past .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

" guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .

she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .
experts and politicians have largely agreed in principle to complete the disclosure and batic has presented the bill to parliament . ngos are claiming victory .
biljana kovacevic-vuco , head of the lawyers ' committee for human rights , is convinced that this is an important step towards the normalization of serbian society . " the disclosure of -lsb- secret service -rsb- files is the first step a state has to make if it wants to come to terms with darker parts of its past .

they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .
as security in iraq slowly stabilizes , german companies will begin to take advantage of business opportunities with their former trading partners in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .
but they are unlikely to completely convince german lawmakers to extend the afghanistan mandate .
germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , struck underlined the significance of that argument .
" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " germans a key player in afghanistan with 2,500 soldiers based in kabul , germans form the largest contingent of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul under u.n. mandate .

deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies . news that deutsche telekom has offered € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- to win control of polish mobile phone operator ptc could either be the first real sign that the german telecommunications giant is looking to expand after two years of debt repayment or that the company is slipping back into bad habits . germany ’ s telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on monday that it had made the offer to buy the 51 per cent of ptc that it does not already own from the polish utility elektrim and french group vivendi universal .
if the deal goes through , and experts believe it will as both elektrim and vivendi invited the german firm to make the offer , it will be telekom ’ s major acquisition in more than two years after a period of poorly executed and overly expensive investments . on the one hand , the 100 percent holding in ptc would give deutsche telekom control of a key group in a fast-developing market .
as telekom is well aware , mobile operations in eastern europe are booming .
current affiliates such as matav in hungary and slovakia ’ s slovenske telekomunikacie both control market leading mobile firms in their respective countries under the watchful eye of telekom ’ s own mobile arm , t-mobile . ptc payment to begin next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler , kai-uwe ricke , karl-gerhard eick .
it could be a good bit of business for europe ’ s largest telecoms provider .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick -lrb- picture , right -rrb- has said deutsche telekom remains on track to reach its target of reducing its debt to around € 50 billion by the end of the year .
payment for ptc would be made in the first three months of 2004 , so as to not jeopardize that goal . if the increase in mobile network roll-outs continues at the current pace in poland , deutsche telekom could see it add a healthy chunk of profits to its bottom line .
it would be a major success for ceo kai-uwe ricke who took over the running of telekom after the acrimonious departure of free-spending former chief ron sommer . since his appointment , ricke has quickly reorganized his management team and has streamlined the structure of the group ’ s four main components ; t-mobile , t-com , t-online and t-systems .
he has since set about implementing his “ 6 + 6 ” debt reduction plan launched in november , within which € 6 billion would be generated from free cash flow and a further € 6 billion would come from the sale of assets . debt reduction plan slowly working the first positive sign that the plan was working came in the first half of this year when deutsche telekom clawed its way out of the red , recording net income of € 256 million in its second quarter to june 30 , compared to a loss of € 2.08 billion a year earlier .
it also cut its debt by € 8.1billion through its policy of selling non-core assets , such as property . much of that success was also attributed to the strong showing of t-mobile .
revenue leapt 18.9 percent in the second quarter to € 5.5 billion with the number of new customers in the united states rising by 1.5 million in the first half to reach 11 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile customers are increasing abroad .
t-mobile now has a total customer base of 61.4 million with overseas revenue now accounting for almost 57 percent of its total .
further investment abroad , therefore , may not be a bad strategy , especially considering the stagnation at home . " it certainly fits with their strategy – -lrb- ptc -rrb- is a fast-growing market and the company is profitable , " heike pauls , a telecoms analyst at the brokerage chevreux , told reuters . a return to over-paying ? so , the ptc deal could well signal recovery and expansion for deutsche telekom .
but on the other hand it could be a return to the days when the company was notorious for over-paying .
some investors have said the ptc deal looks like good value , but many remain cautious , bearing in mind telekom 's reputation and indulgent spending in previous acquisitions . " i 'm a bit ambivalent , " said christian doppstadt , a credit fund manager at westam .
" if you look at the valuation it looks like a good deal .
still , what could give investors a headache is that this could turn out to be a return to old habits .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .

" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .

deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies . news that deutsche telekom has offered € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- to win control of polish mobile phone operator ptc could either be the first real sign that the german telecommunications giant is looking to expand after two years of debt repayment or that the company is slipping back into bad habits . germany ’ s telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on monday that it had made the offer to buy the 51 per cent of ptc that it does not already own from the polish utility elektrim and french group vivendi universal .
if the deal goes through , and experts believe it will as both elektrim and vivendi invited the german firm to make the offer , it will be telekom ’ s major acquisition in more than two years after a period of poorly executed and overly expensive investments . on the one hand , the 100 percent holding in ptc would give deutsche telekom control of a key group in a fast-developing market .
as telekom is well aware , mobile operations in eastern europe are booming .
current affiliates such as matav in hungary and slovakia ’ s slovenske telekomunikacie both control market leading mobile firms in their respective countries under the watchful eye of telekom ’ s own mobile arm , t-mobile . ptc payment to begin next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler , kai-uwe ricke , karl-gerhard eick .
it could be a good bit of business for europe ’ s largest telecoms provider .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick -lrb- picture , right -rrb- has said deutsche telekom remains on track to reach its target of reducing its debt to around € 50 billion by the end of the year .
payment for ptc would be made in the first three months of 2004 , so as to not jeopardize that goal . if the increase in mobile network roll-outs continues at the current pace in poland , deutsche telekom could see it add a healthy chunk of profits to its bottom line .
it would be a major success for ceo kai-uwe ricke who took over the running of telekom after the acrimonious departure of free-spending former chief ron sommer . since his appointment , ricke has quickly reorganized his management team and has streamlined the structure of the group ’ s four main components ; t-mobile , t-com , t-online and t-systems .
he has since set about implementing his “ 6 + 6 ” debt reduction plan launched in november , within which € 6 billion would be generated from free cash flow and a further € 6 billion would come from the sale of assets . debt reduction plan slowly working the first positive sign that the plan was working came in the first half of this year when deutsche telekom clawed its way out of the red , recording net income of € 256 million in its second quarter to june 30 , compared to a loss of € 2.08 billion a year earlier .
it also cut its debt by € 8.1billion through its policy of selling non-core assets , such as property . much of that success was also attributed to the strong showing of t-mobile .
revenue leapt 18.9 percent in the second quarter to € 5.5 billion with the number of new customers in the united states rising by 1.5 million in the first half to reach 11 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile customers are increasing abroad .
t-mobile now has a total customer base of 61.4 million with overseas revenue now accounting for almost 57 percent of its total .
further investment abroad , therefore , may not be a bad strategy , especially considering the stagnation at home . " it certainly fits with their strategy – -lrb- ptc -rrb- is a fast-growing market and the company is profitable , " heike pauls , a telecoms analyst at the brokerage chevreux , told reuters . a return to over-paying ? so , the ptc deal could well signal recovery and expansion for deutsche telekom .
but on the other hand it could be a return to the days when the company was notorious for over-paying .
some investors have said the ptc deal looks like good value , but many remain cautious , bearing in mind telekom 's reputation and indulgent spending in previous acquisitions . " i 'm a bit ambivalent , " said christian doppstadt , a credit fund manager at westam .
" if you look at the valuation it looks like a good deal .
still , what could give investors a headache is that this could turn out to be a return to old habits .

with veteran berlinale festival director , moritz de hadeln at the helm , the sixtieth venice film festival that kicks off wednesday promises to be a lively affair , brimming with sex , controversy and glamour . in his introduction to venice 's sixtieth birthday , de hadeln said that british director peter greenaway had proposed staging a conference in venice entitled ' cinema is dead ! ' , a declaration which he claims could n't be further from the truth .
" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .
german film in running for golden lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some films tackle the issues embedded in , and born out of the recent iraq war , others plough further through the annals of time .
61-year-old german director margarethe von trotta 's -lrb- photo -rrb- latest film , rosenstrasse starring katja reimann and maria schrader journeys back to the third reich , where she retells the events which led to the public protest of german women securing the unexpected release of their interned jewish husbands .
the film , a mixture of history and melodrama , is the only german film in the running for a golden lion .
margarethe von trotta , possibly the best known woman director to emerge from the new german cinema , began her cinema career with heavyweights rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff , before going on to direct her own critically acclaimed feature films .
although rosenstrasse is her first cinema feature for almost a decade , she is no stranger to venice and the thrill of the chase for a golden lion .
in 1981 , she was awarded the coveted prize for her film die bleierne zeit -lrb- marianne and juliane -rrb- .
tough competition there are hundreds of films to be screened before the moment of judgement arrives on september 6th , and as festival organizers are keen to stress , competition this year is tough .
with an unprecedented number of films submitted for inclusion in the program , the jury is in for some late nights .
and as for those just there to enjoy the silver screen , organizers are confident that their palette of ' lively ' film wo n't disappoint .
robert benton is back with a film version of the highly acclaimed philip roth novel the human stain , starring anthony hopkins and nicole kidman .
it tells the story of a distinguished university professor whose professional life is shattered by allegations of racism and whose personal life is overshadowed by a web of lies he has been living for fifty years .
the new coen-brothers thriller starring george clooney and catherine zeta-jones will also feature during the festival , as will robert rodriguez 's desperado film once upon a time in mexico with antonio banderas , salma hayek and johnny depp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2003 german companies get serious about iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the business of rebuilding the war-torn country is underway .
as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .
as security in iraq slowly stabilizes , german companies will begin to take advantage of business opportunities with their former trading partners in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .
support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer -lrb- picture -rrb- said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .
with reports of continuing skirmishes from the volatile outlying regions of afghanistan , the move to kunduz is considered by some as too dangerous .
several german soldiers have already been killed during peacekeeping in kabul . significant contribution to isaf with 2,500 soldiers based in kabul , germans form the largest contingent of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul under u.n. mandate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.08.2003 german companies get serious about iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the business of rebuilding the war-torn country is underway .
as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .

as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .

but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .
as security in iraq slowly stabilizes , german companies will begin to take advantage of business opportunities with their former trading partners in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .

granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .

beagle 2 is due to land on mars some time in december , where it will begin an exploration of the planet 's atmosphere , surface and sub-surface , gathering information about the air with a gas-sniffing ' nose ' and about the physical make-up of the planet with samples from below the surface . endless fascination mars has long been a source of fascination for us earthlings .

on wednesday at 10:51 utc , mars will officially be a ' mere ' 55.76 million kilometers -lrb- 34.65 million miles -rrb- from neighboring earth , which is closer than it has been since the time of the neanderthals .
the big red planet has been slowly moving in on earth for the past few months , and has been visible as a bright orange object in the night sky for many weeks already , outshining everything else in the firmament but the moon and venus .
with a clear sky and a small telescope , mars fans should be able to make out surface details of the planet , such as its southern ice cap . out of orbital sync the scarce nature of this neighborly visit is written in the stars .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .

" i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

on wednesday at 10:51 utc , mars will officially be a ' mere ' 55.76 million kilometers -lrb- 34.65 million miles -rrb- from neighboring earth , which is closer than it has been since the time of the neanderthals .
the big red planet has been slowly moving in on earth for the past few months , and has been visible as a bright orange object in the night sky for many weeks already , outshining everything else in the firmament but the moon and venus .
with a clear sky and a small telescope , mars fans should be able to make out surface details of the planet , such as its southern ice cap . out of orbital sync the scarce nature of this neighborly visit is written in the stars .
like a racing track , the orbital paths of mars and earth run roughly alongside one another , with earth on the inner track on a more-or-less circular orbit and mars on a more elliptical path around the sun . as they are never quite in sync , earth overtakes the red planet once every two years and two months , and once in a blue moon they simultaneously hit the point in their tracks which are closest to one another . according to scientific calculations the last time the planets were actually so close was on september 12 in the year 57,617 before christ .
and although there have been other close encounters since between then and now , none have been quite so dramatic as this one . scientific advantage renowned for their astonishing ability to calculate and predict , scientists have been gearing up for this planetary brushing for some time .
earlier in the summer , nasa launched two new rovers for the exploration of the mysterious planet .
the identical rovers , which are due to land in two different locations on the planet in january 2004 , are equipped with a set of sophisticated instruments to help determine whether climatic conditions at the martian sites could once have been favorable enough to support life . the european space agency also launched a mars probe in the summer .
beagle 2 is due to land on mars some time in december , where it will begin an exploration of the planet 's atmosphere , surface and sub-surface , gathering information about the air with a gas-sniffing ' nose ' and about the physical make-up of the planet with samples from below the surface . endless fascination mars has long been a source of fascination for us earthlings .
since the first close-up pictures of the red planet in 1965 , spacecraft voyages have repeatedly revealed a world with strange and distant familiarities , which have keep scientists hooked and anxious to find out more . what they already know is that mars , like earth , has polar ice caps and clouds in its atmosphere , seasonal weather patterns , volcanoes , canyons and other recognizable features . and although they also know that conditions there are far colder and more sterile than those on our own highly-evolved planet , scientists are now certain that there are great lakes of ice trapped beneath the ground .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .

germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .

german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz . even as the debate continues on whether germany will send soldiers to join peacekeeping operations in iraq , berlin faces another tricky defense question this week . on sunday , an investigation team sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz and probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there came back with a verdict : yes . media reports on monday said that the fact-finding team , comprising members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , were of the opinion that more than a 100 german soldiers could be sent to kunduz . the findings may ease concerns that outlying afghan provinces , beset by lawlessness and ruled by warlords , would be too dangerous for soldiers of the multinational peacekeeping force based in the capital of kabul .
but they are unlikely to completely convince german lawmakers to extend the afghanistan mandate .
germany 's parliament needs to sanction the extension by one year of the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well give the nod to the kunduz deployment . afghan peace in germany 's interest german defense minister peter struck , an increasingly vocal supporter of expanding the afghanistan mission , said on monday a decision would be made in the german cabinet as early as in ten days .
he added the chancellor ’ s security staff would meet by the middle of this week to take a tentative decision after it had heard out the expert team ’ s case . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , struck underlined the significance of that argument .
" special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in an interview . support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .

on wednesday at 10:51 utc , mars will officially be a ' mere ' 55.76 million kilometers -lrb- 34.65 million miles -rrb- from neighboring earth , which is closer than it has been since the time of the neanderthals .
the big red planet has been slowly moving in on earth for the past few months , and has been visible as a bright orange object in the night sky for many weeks already , outshining everything else in the firmament but the moon and venus .
with a clear sky and a small telescope , mars fans should be able to make out surface details of the planet , such as its southern ice cap . out of orbital sync the scarce nature of this neighborly visit is written in the stars .
like a racing track , the orbital paths of mars and earth run roughly alongside one another , with earth on the inner track on a more-or-less circular orbit and mars on a more elliptical path around the sun . as they are never quite in sync , earth overtakes the red planet once every two years and two months , and once in a blue moon they simultaneously hit the point in their tracks which are closest to one another . according to scientific calculations the last time the planets were actually so close was on september 12 in the year 57,617 before christ .
and although there have been other close encounters since between then and now , none have been quite so dramatic as this one . scientific advantage renowned for their astonishing ability to calculate and predict , scientists have been gearing up for this planetary brushing for some time .
earlier in the summer , nasa launched two new rovers for the exploration of the mysterious planet .
the identical rovers , which are due to land in two different locations on the planet in january 2004 , are equipped with a set of sophisticated instruments to help determine whether climatic conditions at the martian sites could once have been favorable enough to support life . the european space agency also launched a mars probe in the summer .
beagle 2 is due to land on mars some time in december , where it will begin an exploration of the planet 's atmosphere , surface and sub-surface , gathering information about the air with a gas-sniffing ' nose ' and about the physical make-up of the planet with samples from below the surface . endless fascination mars has long been a source of fascination for us earthlings .
since the first close-up pictures of the red planet in 1965 , spacecraft voyages have repeatedly revealed a world with strange and distant familiarities , which have keep scientists hooked and anxious to find out more . what they already know is that mars , like earth , has polar ice caps and clouds in its atmosphere , seasonal weather patterns , volcanoes , canyons and other recognizable features . and although they also know that conditions there are far colder and more sterile than those on our own highly-evolved planet , scientists are now certain that there are great lakes of ice trapped beneath the ground .
ice means water and water means that one day in the distant future , there may be a way to plant life on mars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .

disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .
hermann scheer , an spd energy expert , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the government must continue to support wind energy . " the promotion of sustainable energy sources is a real red-green coalition success story , which clement wants to shoot down .
wind power should receive more not less promotion , " he , along with deputy leader of the spd parliamentary group , michael müller , told the newspaper . off-shore wind parks if jürgen trittin has his way , then by the year 2020 , 20 percent of all germany 's power will be generated by wind .
there 's a long way to go before such great chunks of the nation are feeding off sustainable sources , but a step in the right direction is the creation of off-shore wind parks , such as the one scheduled for construction in 2005 off the north sea island of sylt . surprisingly , the idea of such off-shore parks has whipped up a storm of controversy among environmental groups , who fear that huge whirling fans in the sea could be hazards for birds and other marine sea life .

disagreement is gusting through germany 's coalition government at the moment over subsidies for wind energy . the german government is involved in a tug of war on the future of energy policy and the promotion of wind-generated power .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party is in favor of expanding the use of wind power and making sustainable energy not only a household name but a household standard .
but economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is squarely against the mass expansion of wind power as a long-term means of replacing coal , saying subsidies for the wind power industry should be clipped , arguing that there 's a danger that a new " subsidy mentality " could be developing . " we are almost as far along in subsidizing wind energy as we are with coal , " clement told the reuters news agency .
" and we 're about to beat coal , since we 're planning on lowering coal subsidies in the future . " coal subsidies will total around € 3.3 billion this year , although the government is planning on reducing them to € 2.7 billion by 2005 . clement argued that the future of wind power lies in off-shore facilities and complained that some power-generating windmills on land are erected in places where the wind does n't even blow . speaking in a press address in berlin on wednesday , the president of the german wind energy association , peter ahmels , denied that windmills were being constructed in ' windless ' zones .
he said the industry had a flourishing track record and was ready for expansion , which he argued , would secure the 46,000 jobs the sector has thus far created .
ahmels criticised clement 's accusation that wind energy is too great a strain on the public purse . " if the economics minister accuses the branch of being a rip-off , yet simultaneously pours money hand over fist into the coal industry , it would seem that we 've lost our sense of judgement , " he said . environmentalists point out germany will have to eventually reduce its dependence on coal if it wants to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions . rapid growth the public spat between the wind power industry and the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- leader is unusual , since wind generation in germany has been enjoying a boom under the current government .
there are currently more then 14,000 wind power generators in germany , more than anywhere else in the world .
the country generates one third of the world 's wind power .
the sustainable energy lobby argues that now is not the time to put a damper on this rapid growth , particularly when many conventional power stations are in need of renovation and germany has made it official policy to consign nuclear energy to its past . clement 's resistance to increasing support of wind-generated power has been greeted coolly by several members of his own party .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity . " it 's possible that a large number of files were destroyed from october 5th to the 8th , and we think that did happen , " he said .
" but as for suspicions that the files on leading politicians of today were also destroyed at the time , we need proof or at least some kind of evidence for that .
we do n't have any . " high-level resistance there are many who think such proof will never come to light , because leading figures in the dos government do n't want it to . " the people who are resisting publication of the files are people in the ranks of the police , the justice department and the secret services , " said bogoljub milosavljevic with the center for anti-war action .
" they know that if the files were opened , others would be able to see that these leading figures have violated human rights at some time or another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic the investigation following the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- in march of this year showed that milosevic had placed his followers in almost all state-run organizations and that many of those people stayed in key positions even after the dictator was driven from power . making it legal milosavljevic 's group , along with the democratic christian party of serbia -lrb- dhss -rrb- , have written a bill that would overhaul the rules around secret police file access .
the proposed law would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it . according to dhss leader and minister of justice vladan batic , the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files , as well as for specific cases involving third parties .
the police files would be uncensored and would include the names of informants .
experts and politicians have largely agreed in principle to complete the disclosure and batic has presented the bill to parliament . ngos are claiming victory .
biljana kovacevic-vuco , head of the lawyers ' committee for human rights , is convinced that this is an important step towards the normalization of serbian society . " the disclosure of -lsb- secret service -rsb- files is the first step a state has to make if it wants to come to terms with darker parts of its past .
now the possibility for us to look our own past in the face is sitting there right in front of us , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic launches vigorous defence accused of genocide and war crimes , the former yugoslav president ridicules the un court as his lawless captor and launches a robust defence , aided by gory photographs of civilians killed by nato bombs .

by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .
today serbs still do n't have unlimited access to the information kept in them .
that could change soon . dictatorships have a tendency to collect a great deal of information on their citizens .
serbia was no exception .
after 40 years of communism and 13 years of totalitarian rule under slobodan milosevic , the country 's secret police had accumulated hundreds of thousands of files bulging with information it had acquired by spying on its own populace . shortly after slobodan milosevic was ousted in october 2000 , the new government promised serbs they would have unlimited access to files that were kept on them .
granting access would be a necessary step , according to officials , towards coming to terms with the country 's past .
at the same time , they said it would expose those who had spied for the secret service or supported milosevic .
but almost three years later , that promise has still not been kept . " on october 5th , perhaps a little before or a little after , there was an agreement worked out between representatives of the milosevic regime and the democratic opposition of serbia , " said dusan janjic , coordinator with the forum for ethnic relations , a belgrade-based nongovernmental organization .
" the result of which was that institutions continued to employ people , whose past and whose own files were n't exactly clean .
they 're the ones who have a problem with allowing people access to the police files . " he is convinced that the decision to only allow interested parties access to parts of their files that did n't contain the names of informants , was done at the behest of leading officials , who did n't want their past involvement with the serbian secret services brought to light . serbian paranoia politicians from the democratic opposition of serbia -lrb- dos -rrb- have admitted that there were indeed conversations between milosevic supporters in paramilitary groups and the police at the time of the dictator 's fall .
but they defend them as a necessary evil , as the only way to prevent civil war in the balkan country . zarko korac , deputy prime minister of serbia , rejects criticism of dos policy regarding the files .
he said it is a particular balkan characteristic to put stock in conspiracy theories and to tend toward paranoia . " everyone thinks there has been a secret service file opened on him , " he said . he said that such a voluminous number of files was never found after milosevic was driven from power , although he adds that during the days immediately following the overthrow , the new dos government was not able to monitor all secret police activity .

as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .

as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond . as rebuilding efforts in iraq begin in earnest despite a deteriorating security situation , leaders of germany ’ s small to medium-sized companies are increasing their focus on iraq and the possibility of once again doing business in the mideast country .
instead of focusing on major infrastructure projects largely controlled by the united states , which are largely going to american conglomerates like california-based engineering giant bechtel , german companies are focusing on reestablishing their old ties .
they have good reason to : before iraq fell under a united nations embargo in 1990 , germany was one of its top trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the un , german companies still exporting € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
finding ways to retap that once lucrative market will be the subject of a major conference in bonn on sept .
2 organized by the chambers of industry and commerce of a handful of major western german cities .
representatives from around 100 companies will converge at the meeting to consider both the opportunities for and obstacles to opening shop in a country that has been cut off from the world for the greater part of the last 13 years .
restoring old ties dorothea gelan khulusi - who runs the association of iraqi businesses , an organization in germany that represents close to 400 medium-sized companies in iraq – will be a major player at the conference , offering advice from the iraqi point of view to german companies at the conference .
" these companies have all managed to stay above water throughout the embargo years and survived both wars , " she said .
" some of these companies are even equipped with german technologies that are now in need of repair or replacement . "
many are turning to khulusi ’ s organization in order to resume contact with suppliers in germany who can help lead their businesses into post-saddam hussein iraq .
some iraqi companies are already seeking the aid of german companies , like the baghdad cigarette factory operated by sabah sarhid abbas , whose factory was originally equipped by hamburg-based hauni , a company that provides supplies for the cigarette-making industry .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt , abbas said he would like to turn to the germans and not the americans to help refurbish his production facility .
a shaky business environment ?
despite the desire of executives like abbas to do business with germany , companies in iraq and germany face many hurdles .
as long as there is an occupying force and no legitimate iraqi government , rule of law remains arbitrary and there are no guarantees for corporations .
some have complained that the german government has not extended hermes - the government ’ s export guarantee facility that covers investment risks in third world countries – to small and mid-sized businesses that want to invest in iraq .
without any kind of protection in a country where american and british soldiers are still getting killed almost daily , many mid-sized german businesses are questioning the advantage of iraq investments .
but khulusi downplays the situation .
" well , you certainly need the pioneer spirit to enter into business in iraq right now , " she said .
" but you also have to bring a little trust with you .
that ’ s the most important thing .
because iraq isn ’ t a lawless country .
it ’ s a free-trade zone .
you don ’ t need a visa , you don ’ t have to pay any customs and neither do you have to pay any taxes .
iraqi trade law remains in place and the occupying forces haven ’ t changed that .
you could say that what they ’ ve done is cleaned up those rules and taken them back to their original form . "
still , khulusi ’ s organization is discouraging german companies from traveling to iraq right now – the situation is still far too risky .
the most important thing is establishing contacts , she said .
iraqis , she said , are very interested in resuming economic relations .
to that end , germany companies shouldn ’ t fear whether iraqis will be reliable paying customers .
the country ’ s oldest private bank has been reopened , and as soon as the money flows in , germans can begin exporting goods to iraq .
a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conducting an export business with iraq is still logistically difficult .
that ’ s where entrepreneurs like joachim donath step in .
donath is the ceo of m.g. international transports , a logistics business in the western german city of siegen that has done business in iraq since the 1970s .
" even in the past , it was never an easy task to deliver or receive goods in iraq – and this hasn ’ t gotten easier today , " said donath .
" for us , it ’ s actually gotten more difficult .
first of all because of non-existent security .
on the other hand , we already know the country – we have since 1974 – and that ’ s a huge advantage we have over the competition . "
still , savoir-faire has its limitations .
in early july , one of donath ’ s drivers was kidnapped at gunpoint while making a delivery .
both truck and driver were only freed after the kidnappers received a ransom payment of $ 6,000 , according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel .
the dhl factor given german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s outspoken disapproval of the war in iraq , many companies here expected to be shut out of the rebuilding process by their american competitors .
but in situations where german companies are in a position to handle logistics or provide another service that american companies are unable to handle , germans have proven successful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl : now in iraq indeed , express delivery service dhl , operated by former german mail monopoly deutsche post , is one of the largest mail and supplies delivery contractors for the u.s. military in iraq , with multiple daily flights into baghdad carrying as much as 50 tons of daily letters between soldiers and their families .
german companies have learned that america can ’ t go it alone in rebuilding baghdad and the rest of iraq , whose infrastructure has been devastated by two wars and more than a decade of sanctions .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .

on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer -lrb- picture -rrb- said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval . schröder said his security cabinet had supported the deployment of a few hundred soldiers to kunduz in what would be the first significant expansion of peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan now largely confined to the capital kabul . “ it ’ s sensible , necessary and responsible , ” said schröder while announcing the decision to reporters in berlin on wednesday . but schröder added that the step would depend on an expansion of the united nations mandate for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently is led by nato in and around kabul . kunduz report gives green light the decision is based on a report by an investigation team comprising of members of the german armed forces , the interior ministry and the foreign ministry , which was sent to afghanistan to check the security situation in the northern city of kunduz .
their mission was to probe whether german soldiers based in kabul could expand their mission there . the investigation lead to the team issuing a positive statement of the state of the city and paved the way for schröder to prepare his motion for parliament . peacekeepers could head north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
if the motion is passed by the bundestag , up to 250 german troops will move 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north to kunduz from their current base in the capital kabul , to protect reconstruction teams working in the region .
parliament will also discuss sanctioning a one-year extension to the afghanistan mandate , which runs out this december , as well as debating the kunduz deployment . chancellor schröder and other members of his coalition government have repeatedly stressed that securing the peace in afghanistan lies in germany ’ s interests .
earlier this month , defense minister peter struck , a strong advocate of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan , underlined the significance of that argument . " special german interests lie in a region or a country outside europe such as afghanistan , where we are fighting international terrorism and have shown solidarity with our most important coalition partner , the united states , " he said in a recent interview . green support backs up schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer .
support has also come in from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , the once strongly pacifist greens .
on monday , greens defense expert angelika beer -lrb- picture -rrb- said her party was in favor of extending the afghanistan mandate beyond kabul .
she pointed towards the recent bombing on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad , and said the focus should be on providing civil reconstruction teams with adequate security cover .
terrorists , she said , were concentrating ever more on " soft targets . " but critics are fearful of the security implications of such an operation .
with reports of continuing skirmishes from the volatile outlying regions of afghanistan , the move to kunduz is considered by some as too dangerous .

with veteran berlinale festival director , moritz de hadeln at the helm , the sixtieth venice film festival that kicks off wednesday promises to be a lively affair , brimming with sex , controversy and glamour . in his introduction to venice 's sixtieth birthday , de hadeln said that british director peter greenaway had proposed staging a conference in venice entitled ' cinema is dead ! ' , a declaration which he claims could n't be further from the truth .
" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .
german film in running for golden lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some films tackle the issues embedded in , and born out of the recent iraq war , others plough further through the annals of time .
61-year-old german director margarethe von trotta 's -lrb- photo -rrb- latest film , rosenstrasse starring katja reimann and maria schrader journeys back to the third reich , where she retells the events which led to the public protest of german women securing the unexpected release of their interned jewish husbands .
the film , a mixture of history and melodrama , is the only german film in the running for a golden lion .
margarethe von trotta , possibly the best known woman director to emerge from the new german cinema , began her cinema career with heavyweights rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff , before going on to direct her own critically acclaimed feature films .
although rosenstrasse is her first cinema feature for almost a decade , she is no stranger to venice and the thrill of the chase for a golden lion .
in 1981 , she was awarded the coveted prize for her film die bleierne zeit -lrb- marianne and juliane -rrb- .
tough competition there are hundreds of films to be screened before the moment of judgement arrives on september 6th , and as festival organizers are keen to stress , competition this year is tough .
with an unprecedented number of films submitted for inclusion in the program , the jury is in for some late nights .
and as for those just there to enjoy the silver screen , organizers are confident that their palette of ' lively ' film wo n't disappoint .
robert benton is back with a film version of the highly acclaimed philip roth novel the human stain , starring anthony hopkins and nicole kidman .
it tells the story of a distinguished university professor whose professional life is shattered by allegations of racism and whose personal life is overshadowed by a web of lies he has been living for fifty years .
the new coen-brothers thriller starring george clooney and catherine zeta-jones will also feature during the festival , as will robert rodriguez 's desperado film once upon a time in mexico with antonio banderas , salma hayek and johnny depp .

with veteran berlinale festival director , moritz de hadeln at the helm , the sixtieth venice film festival that kicks off wednesday promises to be a lively affair , brimming with sex , controversy and glamour . in his introduction to venice 's sixtieth birthday , de hadeln said that british director peter greenaway had proposed staging a conference in venice entitled ' cinema is dead ! ' , a declaration which he claims could n't be further from the truth .
" cinema is livelier than ever , " de hadeln says .
and he has put together a festival to prove his point .
if the second film feast under his baton has a recurring theme , then it could be sex .
although de hadeln says he does n't want to overstate the point , the festival program includes many explicit statements and scenes , which he says are justified through their artistic merit .
bernardo bertolucci 's latest offering the dreamers , which gives center-stage to a 1968 sexual awakening in france , already has critics comparing it with his steamy film last tango in paris .
then there is french director bruno dumont 's newest offering twenty-nine palms , which tells the story of a primitive love affair in the californian dessert .
islam washes up on venetian shores but sex is by no means the only controversial subject on the agenda at venice this year .
on the contrary , the festival will also serve as a platform for films dealing with anti-islamic sentiment in the wake of the iraq war .
" the fact is that the war in iraq brought up some pretty nasty statements and ignorance about what islam is really all about , " de hadeln , who headed the berlinale for 22 years , told reuters .
" we ’ re not here to school people , but if there are films treating this subject directly or indirectly , i wanted to show them . "
de hadeln believes it is the role of festivals to give filmmakers the chance express themselves , and has included two iranian films and one each from algeria and lebanon , along with a french movie raja , which turns on the spotlight on a moroccan immigrant in france .
german film in running for golden lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some films tackle the issues embedded in , and born out of the recent iraq war , others plough further through the annals of time .
61-year-old german director margarethe von trotta 's -lrb- photo -rrb- latest film , rosenstrasse starring katja reimann and maria schrader journeys back to the third reich , where she retells the events which led to the public protest of german women securing the unexpected release of their interned jewish husbands .
the film , a mixture of history and melodrama , is the only german film in the running for a golden lion .
margarethe von trotta , possibly the best known woman director to emerge from the new german cinema , began her cinema career with heavyweights rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff , before going on to direct her own critically acclaimed feature films .
although rosenstrasse is her first cinema feature for almost a decade , she is no stranger to venice and the thrill of the chase for a golden lion .
in 1981 , she was awarded the coveted prize for her film die bleierne zeit -lrb- marianne and juliane -rrb- .
tough competition there are hundreds of films to be screened before the moment of judgement arrives on september 6th , and as festival organizers are keen to stress , competition this year is tough .

and as for those just there to enjoy the silver screen , organizers are confident that their palette of ' lively ' film wo n't disappoint .
robert benton is back with a film version of the highly acclaimed philip roth novel the human stain , starring anthony hopkins and nicole kidman .
it tells the story of a distinguished university professor whose professional life is shattered by allegations of racism and whose personal life is overshadowed by a web of lies he has been living for fifty years .
the new coen-brothers thriller starring george clooney and catherine zeta-jones will also feature during the festival , as will robert rodriguez 's desperado film once upon a time in mexico with antonio banderas , salma hayek and johnny depp .

but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies . news that deutsche telekom has offered € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- to win control of polish mobile phone operator ptc could either be the first real sign that the german telecommunications giant is looking to expand after two years of debt repayment or that the company is slipping back into bad habits . germany ’ s telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on monday that it had made the offer to buy the 51 per cent of ptc that it does not already own from the polish utility elektrim and french group vivendi universal .
if the deal goes through , and experts believe it will as both elektrim and vivendi invited the german firm to make the offer , it will be telekom ’ s major acquisition in more than two years after a period of poorly executed and overly expensive investments . on the one hand , the 100 percent holding in ptc would give deutsche telekom control of a key group in a fast-developing market .
as telekom is well aware , mobile operations in eastern europe are booming .
current affiliates such as matav in hungary and slovakia ’ s slovenske telekomunikacie both control market leading mobile firms in their respective countries under the watchful eye of telekom ’ s own mobile arm , t-mobile . ptc payment to begin next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler , kai-uwe ricke , karl-gerhard eick .
it could be a good bit of business for europe ’ s largest telecoms provider .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick -lrb- picture , right -rrb- has said deutsche telekom remains on track to reach its target of reducing its debt to around € 50 billion by the end of the year .
payment for ptc would be made in the first three months of 2004 , so as to not jeopardize that goal . if the increase in mobile network roll-outs continues at the current pace in poland , deutsche telekom could see it add a healthy chunk of profits to its bottom line .
it would be a major success for ceo kai-uwe ricke who took over the running of telekom after the acrimonious departure of free-spending former chief ron sommer . since his appointment , ricke has quickly reorganized his management team and has streamlined the structure of the group ’ s four main components ; t-mobile , t-com , t-online and t-systems .
he has since set about implementing his “ 6 + 6 ” debt reduction plan launched in november , within which € 6 billion would be generated from free cash flow and a further € 6 billion would come from the sale of assets . debt reduction plan slowly working the first positive sign that the plan was working came in the first half of this year when deutsche telekom clawed its way out of the red , recording net income of € 256 million in its second quarter to june 30 , compared to a loss of € 2.08 billion a year earlier .
it also cut its debt by € 8.1billion through its policy of selling non-core assets , such as property . much of that success was also attributed to the strong showing of t-mobile .
revenue leapt 18.9 percent in the second quarter to € 5.5 billion with the number of new customers in the united states rising by 1.5 million in the first half to reach 11 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile customers are increasing abroad .
t-mobile now has a total customer base of 61.4 million with overseas revenue now accounting for almost 57 percent of its total .
further investment abroad , therefore , may not be a bad strategy , especially considering the stagnation at home . " it certainly fits with their strategy – -lrb- ptc -rrb- is a fast-growing market and the company is profitable , " heike pauls , a telecoms analyst at the brokerage chevreux , told reuters . a return to over-paying ? so , the ptc deal could well signal recovery and expansion for deutsche telekom .
but on the other hand it could be a return to the days when the company was notorious for over-paying .
some investors have said the ptc deal looks like good value , but many remain cautious , bearing in mind telekom 's reputation and indulgent spending in previous acquisitions . " i 'm a bit ambivalent , " said christian doppstadt , a credit fund manager at westam .
" if you look at the valuation it looks like a good deal .
still , what could give investors a headache is that this could turn out to be a return to old habits .

on wednesday at 10:51 utc , mars will officially be a ' mere ' 55.76 million kilometers -lrb- 34.65 million miles -rrb- from neighboring earth , which is closer than it has been since the time of the neanderthals .
the big red planet has been slowly moving in on earth for the past few months , and has been visible as a bright orange object in the night sky for many weeks already , outshining everything else in the firmament but the moon and venus .
with a clear sky and a small telescope , mars fans should be able to make out surface details of the planet , such as its southern ice cap . out of orbital sync the scarce nature of this neighborly visit is written in the stars .
like a racing track , the orbital paths of mars and earth run roughly alongside one another , with earth on the inner track on a more-or-less circular orbit and mars on a more elliptical path around the sun . as they are never quite in sync , earth overtakes the red planet once every two years and two months , and once in a blue moon they simultaneously hit the point in their tracks which are closest to one another . according to scientific calculations the last time the planets were actually so close was on september 12 in the year 57,617 before christ .
and although there have been other close encounters since between then and now , none have been quite so dramatic as this one . scientific advantage renowned for their astonishing ability to calculate and predict , scientists have been gearing up for this planetary brushing for some time .
earlier in the summer , nasa launched two new rovers for the exploration of the mysterious planet .
the identical rovers , which are due to land in two different locations on the planet in january 2004 , are equipped with a set of sophisticated instruments to help determine whether climatic conditions at the martian sites could once have been favorable enough to support life . the european space agency also launched a mars probe in the summer .
beagle 2 is due to land on mars some time in december , where it will begin an exploration of the planet 's atmosphere , surface and sub-surface , gathering information about the air with a gas-sniffing ' nose ' and about the physical make-up of the planet with samples from below the surface . endless fascination mars has long been a source of fascination for us earthlings .
since the first close-up pictures of the red planet in 1965 , spacecraft voyages have repeatedly revealed a world with strange and distant familiarities , which have keep scientists hooked and anxious to find out more . what they already know is that mars , like earth , has polar ice caps and clouds in its atmosphere , seasonal weather patterns , volcanoes , canyons and other recognizable features . and although they also know that conditions there are far colder and more sterile than those on our own highly-evolved planet , scientists are now certain that there are great lakes of ice trapped beneath the ground .
ice means water and water means that one day in the distant future , there may be a way to plant life on mars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions .

a british education web site has stirred up controversy by letting school children go -lrb- virtually -rrb- face-to-face with one of the most notorious germans of all time , nazi dictator adolf hitler . it 's a dream of an opportunity for any student of modern history : to get inside the head of one of the most infamous germans of the 20th century and ask him ' why ? ' on the active history website , students can do just that .
on it , school children are able to interview a virtual adolf hitler . at www.activehistory.co.uk , students can quiz the nazi dictator on issues as wide-ranging as his opinion of jews , the role of women in nazi germany right down to personal information , such as when and where the failed austrian artist turned third reich leader was born . the site - which has won several awards and has been described by british newspaper the guardian as " perhaps the best history site around " - is the creation of british history teacher r. j. karr .
he says he wanted to spice up history lessons by using internet technology . " i first used the internet in 1998 and quickly became aware of the potential it offered not only for research but also for interactive learning , " karr writes on the site . quickly the wolverhampton grammar school teacher had a site up and running and has developed all manner of online games and activities to make learning history more fun .
students can also interview a virtual king henry viii , try out a simulation of the 1929 wall street crash or play a strategy game based on the battle of hastings called : " do n't lose your head . " candid answers to tricky questions the virtual adolf hitler is nothing if not candid .
on the interview page , a picture of adolf hitler is featured next to a text box where students can enter questions .
for example : " why do you hate jews ? " seconds later hitler 's mouth starts to move and the answer appears in text across the screen : " in my view , jews in particular have no loyalty to any nation and only look out for themselves .
i felt that it was their profiteering in world war one that divided the master race and brought us to a humiliating defeat and needed to be punished .
wherever i went i began to see jews and the more i saw , the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity .
julius streicher was one of the first people i used to promote anti-semitism . " likewise , ask hitler about the role of women and his answer is just as straight : " the women 's place is in the home … each woman has a duty to produce as many children for the fatherland as possible . " guilty of promoting neo-nazism ? many have attacked karr 's methods of tackling this controversial topic and say he is guilty of promoting neo-nazism .
one report cited historian dietmar süß , who works at the munich institute of contemporary history , as saying it was " naïve " to think that simply reading some hitler quotes would enable students to fully understand national socialism . the head of the german historical institute in london , lothar kettenecker , called the british preoccupation with the third reich " downright obsessive " and added the cult of the führer had become " a genre like that of the wild west film . " but karr has hit back at his critics : " dismissing hitler as ' pure evil ' ignores the fact that millions of ordinary , supposedly ' decent ' people supported him , " karr says on the site .
" sweeping this fact under the carpet is much more irresponsible and dangerous than tackling it head on . "
" empathizing with the german people who supported hitler does not mean sympathizing with them , but it does prevent us complacently dismissing the evils of nazism as a ' german problem ' and thereby leaves us much better equipped to tackle similar tragic situations if and when they arise again , " he continues .
indeed , not all of the answers hitler gives on the site are plain nazi ideological rants .
ask the nazi dictator about his personal history and the following , more rational reply is given : " i was born on 20th april 1889 in braunau am inn , a pretty austrian town with houses painted in pastel yellows , pinks and blues .
the house in which i was born is now used as a ' centre of international understanding ' as a warning of the prejudice and hatred my regime generated .
