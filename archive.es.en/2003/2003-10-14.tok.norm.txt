the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .

the payment , a largely symbolic gesture , was requested by an association made up of sudeten germans expelled from what is today the czech republic in 1945 .
several high-profile german politicians quietly supported the payment which the association saw as a " humanitarian gesture . "
the german-czech future fund , established by german and czech leaders in 1997 , voted on monday against the gesture , saying that it did n't fit with the fund 's goals because it did n't deal with a project of interest to both sides .
the sum of the proposed payment was not disclosed . more briefs 13.10.2003 -pipe- close hitler aide dies 13.10.2003 -pipe- accused admits guilt in child molestation case 13.10.2003 -pipe- fischer says middle east “ extremely worrying ” 13.10.2003 -pipe- u.n. votes on german kunduz deployment 10.10.2003 -pipe- ballack recovery cheers germany before crucial match 09.10.2003 -pipe- muhammed ali at the frankfurt book fair 09.10.2003 -pipe- german kids carrying cash 08.10.2003 -pipe- organizers ' stasi revelations haunt leipzig olympic bid 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.10.2003 germany tops export league table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeps making them , foreign economies keep buying them these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .
the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .

the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .

instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .

from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .

tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.10.2003 germany tops export league table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeps making them , foreign economies keep buying them these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .
the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .

there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

several high-profile german politicians quietly supported the payment which the association saw as a " humanitarian gesture . "

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .
the school ’ s budget , approximately € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- annually , will come from a combination of state and the city funding in addition to funds provided by various sponsors and the public broadcaster südwestrundfunk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people behind the pop academy are well-known fixtures on the german music landscape .
the principles , dahmen , hubert wandjo and dirk metzger -lrb- photo -rrb- , are all music managers or working musicians .
there are about a dozen other instructors on staff as well as freelance teachers , including the popular german r & b artist xavier naidoo .
“ the students are particularly interested in the mistakes made by such well-known people in their early days , ” isabel palmtag , the school 's spokeswoman told reporters .
business before pleasure but for today ’ s savvy students , that interest extends just as much to the business side of things as to artistic considerations .
“ you simply need to know how the art business works , ” said palmtag , and that ’ s why the academy is putting the emphasis on the commerce of art just as much as on the singing and dancing .
in other pop music programs , such as those offered more and more frequently at music colleges , the business end is just a sideline .
the pop academy puts it right in the center , reflecting what the industry itself has already done . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .

fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .
but the pop academy is teaching about more than just midriffs and lip-synching , students there will learn how the pop music business works . students starting classes on monday in the city of mannheim ’ s new institute of learning likely won ’ t be cracking the history books or balancing chemical equations .
instead , they ’ ll be sharpening their dance moves , getting their voices in shape and learning how to negotiate a record contract .
the pop academy , the first of its kind in germany , is giving its 54 students the skills it says they ’ ll need if they want to make it in the pop music world , either as performers or behind the scenes as producers .
there are two degree courses on offer .
in the “ pop music design ” track , students can learn to write and produce songs and maybe , just maybe , how to become the next christina or justin .
those who opt for the “ music industry ” degree plan will pick up the basics of managing a performer , drawing up a contract or booking gigs .
“ it might all look glamorous , but it ’ s really hard work and discipline , ” udo dahmen , head of the pop academy , told the german news agency dpa .
“ we want our graduates to be able to make a living with music their entire lives . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school ’ s concept has found resonance among a german populace which has been inundated with shows promising to find the next big thing in the pop universe .
“ star search , ” “ germany ’ s superstar , ” and “ the german voice 2003 “ -lrb- photo -rrb- are just a few of the recent offerings on german tv that show young people taking their best shot at 15 minutes of fame .
tough competition some 700 people from germany , switzerland and austria applied for the 55 spots available for the pop academy ’ s first semester .
hopefuls had to take entrance exams to get in and those going into the pop courses auditioned in front of a jury .
in the end , only 54 people showed the right kind of “ lateral thinking ” to get a place in the school , according to dahmen .
in three years these young people , mostly between the ages of 18 and 25 , will graduate with a bachelor of arts degree and real-world skills that are necessary to make it in the often dog-eat-dog world of bubble gum pop .
“ a band , a studio team , these are businesses , ” said dahmen , adding that students will leave the academy as professionals on both the commercial and artistic level . for € 500 -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- a semester , potential pop stars and impresarios will mix theory with practice , attending classroom lectures and taking internships at music companies .
some of the courses on offer include “ how to build an act , ” “ how to produce a hit , ” “ starting a business ” and “ image , stage and performance . ”
headmaster dahmen insists the school is not a factory for pop music clones and stresses that originality is one of the top priorities .
nor does he have any illusions that every graduate is going on to britney-style success .
“ stars are rare creatures .
a star is someone who can recreate pop , ” he told reporters .
from rock to pop the academy can trace its origins back to 1997 , when the state of baden-württemberg , where mannheim is located , founded the “ rock foundation , " set up to promote the regional rock and pop music scene .
after four years of negotiations , the state government decided to set up the pop school , with degree programs recognized by the german higher education framework act .

the payment , a largely symbolic gesture , was requested by an association made up of sudeten germans expelled from what is today the czech republic in 1945 .
several high-profile german politicians quietly supported the payment which the association saw as a " humanitarian gesture . "
the german-czech future fund , established by german and czech leaders in 1997 , voted on monday against the gesture , saying that it did n't fit with the fund 's goals because it did n't deal with a project of interest to both sides .
the sum of the proposed payment was not disclosed . more briefs 13.10.2003 -pipe- close hitler aide dies 13.10.2003 -pipe- accused admits guilt in child molestation case 13.10.2003 -pipe- fischer says middle east “ extremely worrying ” 13.10.2003 -pipe- u.n. votes on german kunduz deployment 10.10.2003 -pipe- ballack recovery cheers germany before crucial match 09.10.2003 -pipe- muhammed ali at the frankfurt book fair 09.10.2003 -pipe- german kids carrying cash 08.10.2003 -pipe- organizers ' stasi revelations haunt leipzig olympic bid radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

the latest comes in the form of news that germany has toppled the united states as the world ’ s number one exporter . german businesses have contributed to making germany the world ’ s largest exporter for the first time in 11 years , raising optimism that unpopular wage capping has boosted the competitiveness of german industry . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , germany recorded $ 62 billion -lrb- € 55.6 billion -rrb- in exports in august , over 7 percent more in dollar terms than the united states , the consistent world leader .
the report , based on figures from the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , shows that germany has been ahead of the united states in terms of export levels since april this year . best showing since the early 90 's german export figures have been suffering since the early 1990 ’ s due to the perceived lack of appeal of german products abroad , high wages and the sharp appreciation of the deutsch mark that followed reunification .
but , according to the experts , by controlling costs germany has been able to rise to the top of the export league table once more , forcing the u.s. into second place and japan into third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is helping german exports ... for now .
" today , we do n't have these problems any more , " said harald jörg , an economist at dresdner bank told the ftd while elga bartsch , an analyst at morgan stanley , said germany had profited from a strong presence in export markets in eastern and central europe .
fabian wehnert of the bdi , the german industry federation , told the paper that trade with the new eu member states had risen by about 6 percent .
the surge of the euro against the dollar in the first half of this year has also been a contributing factor .
good export news continues the latest good news concerning german trade follows on from last year ’ s figures that showed that germany was the market leader in machinery exports with 19 percent of the global market share , ahead of the u.s. with 14.9 percent and japan with 12.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : size is n't everything .
however , if high exchange rates continue , they could be a threat to germany ’ s current position in the long run .
the recent strong export performance comes just a week after the euro soared to near-record highs against the u.s. currency , triggering worries that its continuing ascent could hamper german export growth and damage the eurozone 's fragile upturn . more growth forecast for 2004 despite this possibility , the bdi reported this week that it expects german exports to keep growing , by at least 4 percent in 2004 according to the federation ’ s statement on monday .
but imports are also expected to rise and at an even faster pace as a result of the strong euro . if they do n't , then exports will continue to push the domestic economy forward to a recovery on its own , according to bdi director ludolf von wartenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strong euro worries german exporters german companies are starting to worry that the strong euro could begin to hamper exports as their goods become more expensive abroad , which in turn could hurt growth in europe ’ s largest economy .

a further gain may force it to revise its forecast for two percent growth in the industry next year .
" if we get a sustained further appreciation , in the direction of $ 1.25 or $ 1.30 , then we will see problems for exporters , " said ralph wiechers , chief economist at vdma in frankfurt .
" we would then look at our forecast . "
the euro 's appreciation is damping the outlook for german machinery makers , who are counting on a global recovery to help germany emerge from a recession in the first half .
vdma president diether klingelnberg said in august he expects the euro to rise to around $ 1.25 by the end of the year .
european central bank council member ernst welteke said while the euro 's 18 percent appreciation in the past year is still " acceptable , " an " abrupt " appreciation would harm the world economy . more briefs 14.10.2003 -pipe- toll collect ceo ousted 13.10.2003 -pipe- government to lighten insurers ' load 13.10.2003 -pipe- minister : apprenticeships need to be part of wage deals 13.10.2003 -pipe- new accusations against deutsche bank 's ackermann 10.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche telekom appeals to germany 's highest court 10.10.2003 -pipe- lufthansa to slash 2,000 jobs 10.10.2003 -pipe- no boost expected in german labor market until 2005 10.10.2003 -pipe- life insurers wo n't compensate terrorism radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

recent media reports have highlighted the growing international awareness of how german-built submarines are expanding israel 's nuclear capacity . a report this weekend by the los angeles times on how the israelis have modified american-supplied cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads has re-ignited concern about germany ’ s role in providing the country submarines that can launch them from the sea . although it ’ s long been an open secret that israel has nuclear weapons , the paper cited senior bush administration and israeli officials confirming that israel now has the ability to launch atomic weapons from the sea , as well as land and air . critics have long questioned germany ’ s sale of three “ dolphin ” -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 .
at the time , they demanded to know what the ships would be used for , and criticized germany for ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . but according to the german newsmagazine der spiegel , germany ’ s economy ministry has confirmed that israel has put out feelers about acquiring two further submarines , which could be used for the same purposes .
that , in turn , has sparked renewed concern over the submarine sales . the magazine said german-provided submarines could make possible a pre-emptive attack on iran , an avowed enemy of israel , in the case tehran develops nuclear weapons . israel modifies subs the first three israeli submarines were modified in german shipyards fur undisclosed reasons .
in 1999 , the german defense ministry responded to inquiries by green party politicians angelika beer und winfried nachtwei by saying : " it is not clear to the government for what reason the dolphin-class submarine have been fitted out with 650 millimeter artillery pieces that are able to launch submarine harpoon-rockets . ” " it was like , ‘ what i don ’ t know won ’ t hurt me , ’ " said otfried nassauer , head of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin .
he said he assumes that the first delivery of a submarine – the contract was signed in 1991 in the wake of the first iraq war - was an attempt to make amends for the fact that the germans had previously provided weapons to iraq . outfitting submarines for nuclear use brings a part of jerusalem ’ s unacknowledged nuclear program to the sea .
from the sea , israel would be less vulnerable than in the air should it wish to lead a pre-emptive attack on iranian targets . the request for the two new dolphin-class subs puts pressure on its long-established arms supplier , germany , for aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . tight spot for germany " politically it would be impossible to justify .
it would dangerously heat up the middle east conflict , " nassauer said . israel ’ s arab neighbors had already strongly criticized the first delivery of subs to israel .
" given the knowledge that the first three boats have been transformed into atomic launching pads , germany can only answer the request with a clear ‘ no ’ , " nassauer said . according to der spiegel , it is unlikely that berlin would flat out deny israel ’ s request .
more likely , germany ’ s security committee , which makes decisions on weapons contracts , would try to put off the awkward decision . the leaks from the u.s. and israeli officials are likely an organized attempt to dissuade iran from continuing work on its suspected nuclear program .
iran denies developing nuclear weapons and claims it only wants nuclear power plants for generating electricity . israel has never officially confirmed having nuclear arms , but washington has accepted it as a nuclear power since 1969 and analysts say it has up to 200 sophisticated nuclear weapons .
arab countries have criticized the united states and the united nations for pressuring iran to accept tougher inspections while ignoring the stockpile in israel , which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin in september .

three former ibm workers and the family of a fourth , who has since died , say they were exposed to dangerous chemicals through their work in so-called " clean rooms " , where microchips and other electronic parts are made in a dust-free environment .
it is the first of what could be hundreds of actions by former employees of ibm and other electronics companies in the us and in britain .
the test case follows years of argument over the safety of working in such clean rooms .
financial implications lawyers for the group argue the clean rooms are designed to protect the products but not the workers .
they say the former employees developed cancer after being exposed to a range of poisonous chemicals day after day .
the lawyers say the companies ' own records show that over a period of years , workers in ibm clean rooms developed more of certain types of cancer and died younger than the rest of the population .
ibm says that is simply not true .
hundreds more cases in the united states and britain could depend on the outcome of this trial , which is being heard at a courthouse in california 's silicon valley .
the financial implications for the industry are enormous .

all of which begs the question , what was i doing in woodland on the borders of east sussex and kent trying to track one down ?
well , after reports as many as 1,000 wild boar are roaming free in the south east - an area better known for its proximity to london than its wildlife - i was keen to see the evidence for myself .
my guide was ian douglas , a farmer from woodchurch in kent who has spent more than a decade following the creatures , learning their habits and shooting the odd few as game .
how to spot your boar boar are generally nocturnal look out for distinctive two-toed tracks they often make muddy wallows and dry day nests trees may be scraped with dried mud or marked by tusks the ground may be furrowed by their snouts as we headed down a leafy path into the forestry commission-owned woods - bordering land belonging to pop star paul mccartney - he issued his first instructions .
" if we do come across a boar , do n't move .
you wo n't have time to run away or climb a tree - just stand still and we 'll work out what to do next . "
not the most comforting words but they inspired an unusual thrill of danger .
mr douglas , a veteran of countless trips into the woods at night when the wild boar are most active , has had several close encounters .
i just felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck - i knew something was there farmer ian douglas " the most i 've ever seen together at one time was nine adults and their piglets , " he said .
" one time i was here and i just felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck - i knew something was there .
" when i turned round there was a sow and her piglets , watching me .
i had n't heard a thing . "
the signs of the animals ' presence are everywhere , once an old hand points them out .
furrowed turf by the path - which would barely have warranted a glance before - turns out to be a prime indication of wild boar .
snout hole " they turn it over with their snouts to find worms and grubs , " said mr douglas .
" you can see the snout hole there if you look . "
he leads me on through the woodland , passing several boar runs , or paths , through the undergrowth and trees marked by tusks .
eventually we reach a wallow - one of several muddy puddles in the woodland frequented by our quarry .
boar have scratched on the tree trunk after wallowing in mud the pool is surrounded by two-toed tracks and the tell-tale splatters where the boar have shaken themselves after rolling in the cooling mud .
" see that track ? " asks my guide .
" that 's fresh - probably only a few hours old .
you can see the mud on the undergrowth where they 've passed through afterwards . "
with the boar lurking perhaps only yards away in the bracken we move on , reaching a tree where the creatures have been scratching .
" they usually rub on pine trees because if they break the bark to reach the resin , it kills the parasites , " said mr douglas .
wild boar , it would seem , are remarkably intelligent - and almost invariably spot us before we see them .
boar necessities full grown adult boar can weigh up to 400 lb -lrb- 180 kg -rrb- they can measure six feet -lrb- two metres -rrb- from snout to tail male boars grow tusks after they reach two years old a sow will usually have three to eight piglets wild boar are omnivorous but eat mostly plant matter their diet can include mice , birds ' eggs and lizards boar have poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell they have a better sense of smell than a fox and very sharp hearing , mr douglas says , though this is tempered by poor eyesight .
the boars ' talent for concealing themselves is proven by our failure to spot a single one , despite two hours spent peering into undergrowth .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- is currently looking at whether boar living wild should be culled - or the public taught how to live with them .
some farmers claim they carry diseases such as foot and mouth and cause damage to crops .
but mr douglas believes any plans by the government to exterminate the boar will be impossible to achieve .
boar can punch their way through wire fences in search of food conservationist peter smith , who runs the wildwood trust centre near herne bay , kent , is also opposed to any cull .
he says boris , the centre 's four-year-old male boar , and its two sows have an important role to play in maintaining woodland in a natural way .
by clearing plants such as rhododendrons and rooting up the ground searching for food , the boar improve the habitat for other animals .
mr smith fears ill-equipped hunters will worsen any potential problems rather than reducing the boars ' population .
" if they do decide to cull them , how are they going to do it ? " he said .
" they will probably shoot them in the wrong place and they will get enraged - and the last thing you need is a wounded wild boar running about . "

how to spot your boar boar are generally nocturnal look out for distinctive two-toed tracks they often make muddy wallows and dry day nests trees may be scraped with dried mud or marked by tusks the ground may be furrowed by their snouts as we headed down a leafy path into the forestry commission-owned woods - bordering land belonging to pop star paul mccartney - he issued his first instructions .
" if we do come across a boar , do n't move .
you wo n't have time to run away or climb a tree - just stand still and we 'll work out what to do next . "
not the most comforting words but they inspired an unusual thrill of danger .
mr douglas , a veteran of countless trips into the woods at night when the wild boar are most active , has had several close encounters .
i just felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck - i knew something was there farmer ian douglas " the most i 've ever seen together at one time was nine adults and their piglets , " he said .
" one time i was here and i just felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck - i knew something was there .
" when i turned round there was a sow and her piglets , watching me .
i had n't heard a thing . "
the signs of the animals ' presence are everywhere , once an old hand points them out .
furrowed turf by the path - which would barely have warranted a glance before - turns out to be a prime indication of wild boar .
snout hole " they turn it over with their snouts to find worms and grubs , " said mr douglas .
" you can see the snout hole there if you look . "
he leads me on through the woodland , passing several boar runs , or paths , through the undergrowth and trees marked by tusks .
eventually we reach a wallow - one of several muddy puddles in the woodland frequented by our quarry .
boar have scratched on the tree trunk after wallowing in mud the pool is surrounded by two-toed tracks and the tell-tale splatters where the boar have shaken themselves after rolling in the cooling mud .
" see that track ? " asks my guide .
" that 's fresh - probably only a few hours old .
you can see the mud on the undergrowth where they 've passed through afterwards . "
with the boar lurking perhaps only yards away in the bracken we move on , reaching a tree where the creatures have been scratching .
" they usually rub on pine trees because if they break the bark to reach the resin , it kills the parasites , " said mr douglas .
wild boar , it would seem , are remarkably intelligent - and almost invariably spot us before we see them .
boar necessities full grown adult boar can weigh up to 400 lb -lrb- 180 kg -rrb- they can measure six feet -lrb- two metres -rrb- from snout to tail male boars grow tusks after they reach two years old a sow will usually have three to eight piglets wild boar are omnivorous but eat mostly plant matter their diet can include mice , birds ' eggs and lizards boar have poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell they have a better sense of smell than a fox and very sharp hearing , mr douglas says , though this is tempered by poor eyesight .
the boars ' talent for concealing themselves is proven by our failure to spot a single one , despite two hours spent peering into undergrowth .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- is currently looking at whether boar living wild should be culled - or the public taught how to live with them .
some farmers claim they carry diseases such as foot and mouth and cause damage to crops .
but mr douglas believes any plans by the government to exterminate the boar will be impossible to achieve .
boar can punch their way through wire fences in search of food conservationist peter smith , who runs the wildwood trust centre near herne bay , kent , is also opposed to any cull .
he says boris , the centre 's four-year-old male boar , and its two sows have an important role to play in maintaining woodland in a natural way .
by clearing plants such as rhododendrons and rooting up the ground searching for food , the boar improve the habitat for other animals .
mr smith fears ill-equipped hunters will worsen any potential problems rather than reducing the boars ' population .
" if they do decide to cull them , how are they going to do it ? " he said .
" they will probably shoot them in the wrong place and they will get enraged - and the last thing you need is a wounded wild boar running about . "

they imagine old photos showing rows of machines enclosing patients ravaged by polio in 1950s wards - old-style technology tackling diseases rarely seen in this country today .
so it is a surprise to walk into a modern nhs hospital and find what is essentially a working antique keeping a patient alive .
john prestwich 's iron lung is a pleasant shade of cream and pastel green , and it can be found in st thomas ' hospital on the banks of the thames in london .
it remains a shocking sight - a cylinder the length of a family car , and probably weighing twice as much , with a seemingly disembodied human head emerging from one end .
it interrupts its quiet surroundings with a regular whoosh as an oversized bellows contraption at the rear pulls the air in and out of the casing .
moving a little closer and peering through tiny submarine-style windows , you can see john 's chest gently rise and fall in time .
the lung pulls air in and out of the lungs john , paralysed from the chin down , is 64 - and holds the dubious distinction of being the longest surviving beneficiary of iron lung technology .
he has not taken a breath for himself since he was struck down with polio at the age of 17 .
to him , the sound of the rising and falling bellows is the drumbeat of his life .
" this machine is like a comfortable friend , not a prison , " he told bbc news online .
" when you live with a noise like that all the time , you do n't notice it at all .
what is deafening is silence - if it stops working . "
if this machine were to fail , without the assistance of the dedicated staff in the ward , he could be dead within three minutes .
to be fair , although john has needed artificial breathing for the past 48 years - and spent a decade-and-a-half encased in an iron lung during the 1950s and 1960s - this is not his daily routine .
75 years of the iron lung first tested on humans in 1928 by american philip drinker by 1939 , there were almost 1,000 in use in the uk many patients paralysed by polio - first vaccine introduced in 1954 modern technology has replaced this two-tonne monster with a chest-sized device shaped like a turtle-shell , and which does almost exactly the same thing , in the hertfordshire home he shares with his wife maggie .
however , this week , john has come down with a chest infection , and , since he can not cough , must come into st thomas ' to spend a few days in the full-sized version while nurses pummel his chest to loosen the phlegm .
" it 's no exaggeration to say that this unit , and the wonderful care i get here , has saved my life on many occasions , " he said .
polio pain the idea behind the artificial lung is gloriously simple .
the typical patient can not use his or her breathing muscles to inflate the lungs , but if a way could be found to draw up the chest , it would create a space in the lungs that would automatically be filled by air flowing in through the mouth and nose .
once a patient is enclosed by the machine , a perfect seal is created .
when the air is pumped out of the casing , the reduction in pressure makes the chest rise , filling the lungs .
this machine is decades old when the air is allowed back in , the lungs empty .
the iron lung is forever linked in the mind with the devastating disease polio , and this is exactly how john became paralysed in 1955 .
polio attacks the nerves controlling the muscles , resulting in varying degrees of weakness , then paralysis .
some are relatively lucky - they get away with impaired movement in an arm or a leg - but others , like john , are less fortunate .
the daily hard physical labour involved in his job as a deckhand on a merchant navy vessel meant that virtually all his muscles were affected .
this machine is like a comfortable friend , not a prison john prestwich he woke up one evening and found he could not lift his face off his cabin pillow - which in itself , was nearly the end of him .
medics resorted to desperate measures to save the life of the teenager as he headed for hospital .
" when i was taken off the boat , my breathing almost stopped completely .
" they had me laid on the stretcher , and were rocking me backwards and forwards , which moved air in and out of my lungs . "
" when i woke up , i was a 17-year-old , surrounded by people i did n't know , i could n't speak , there was something in front of me and this swishing noise .
" i never realised then that this noise would be with me every minute of every day for the next 48 years . "
many would have given up hope at this point , but perhaps one of the secrets of john 's survival was his determination not to be bettered by his condition .
" the only thing i regret is that , when i was 18 , i did n't go and put a bet on me going to get my old age pension - i could have got great odds on that .
" i have always considered my disability to be my enemy , and i have fought the restrictions it placed upon me . "
this took the form of making the effort to get out of hospital every now and again - a risky business for someone so dependent on machinery .
on one trip out , he found himself in deep trouble - and miles from the safety of the ward and his iron lung .
" the trouble was there was so little equipment back then .
if i left the hospital , i had to be ' hand-pumped ' with this little set of bellows .
" on one occasion , the person doing this expanded the bellows too far and they broke .
that was certainly a hairy moment .
" he pulled the rubber back over the box and we got the driver to get back to the hospital at top speed . "
life transformed on other occasions his absent minded companions would be a problem .
" we used to go to the cinema - but if the film got a bit exciting my breathing tended to go to cock ! "
it is the last decade and the increase in computing power that has transformed his life .
his home is now fully automated , with a computer which can respond to his whistled commands .
" when this first happened , i could n't even ring the alarm bell - but now i can send a fax to america . "
some things , though , are likely to remain beyond him .
" i 'm due for my free bus pass in a couple of weeks , " he says .
" ca n't see me using it much . "

they imagine old photos showing rows of machines enclosing patients ravaged by polio in 1950s wards - old-style technology tackling diseases rarely seen in this country today .
so it is a surprise to walk into a modern nhs hospital and find what is essentially a working antique keeping a patient alive .
john prestwich 's iron lung is a pleasant shade of cream and pastel green , and it can be found in st thomas ' hospital on the banks of the thames in london .
it remains a shocking sight - a cylinder the length of a family car , and probably weighing twice as much , with a seemingly disembodied human head emerging from one end .
it interrupts its quiet surroundings with a regular whoosh as an oversized bellows contraption at the rear pulls the air in and out of the casing .
moving a little closer and peering through tiny submarine-style windows , you can see john 's chest gently rise and fall in time .
the lung pulls air in and out of the lungs john , paralysed from the chin down , is 64 - and holds the dubious distinction of being the longest surviving beneficiary of iron lung technology .
he has not taken a breath for himself since he was struck down with polio at the age of 17 .
to him , the sound of the rising and falling bellows is the drumbeat of his life .
" this machine is like a comfortable friend , not a prison , " he told bbc news online .
" when you live with a noise like that all the time , you do n't notice it at all .
what is deafening is silence - if it stops working . "
if this machine were to fail , without the assistance of the dedicated staff in the ward , he could be dead within three minutes .
to be fair , although john has needed artificial breathing for the past 48 years - and spent a decade-and-a-half encased in an iron lung during the 1950s and 1960s - this is not his daily routine .
75 years of the iron lung first tested on humans in 1928 by american philip drinker by 1939 , there were almost 1,000 in use in the uk many patients paralysed by polio - first vaccine introduced in 1954 modern technology has replaced this two-tonne monster with a chest-sized device shaped like a turtle-shell , and which does almost exactly the same thing , in the hertfordshire home he shares with his wife maggie .
however , this week , john has come down with a chest infection , and , since he can not cough , must come into st thomas ' to spend a few days in the full-sized version while nurses pummel his chest to loosen the phlegm .
" it 's no exaggeration to say that this unit , and the wonderful care i get here , has saved my life on many occasions , " he said .

in a policy platform for the poll launched on tuesday , junichiro koizumi promised 3 million new jobs by 2005 .
he also aimed for 2 % economic growth in 2006 and a halving of the bad debt burden crippling japan 's banks .
many of the reforms repeat pledges made when he became premier in 2001 , but have since run into the sand .
mr koizumi has faced repeated opposition from within his liberal democratic party to his more extreme plans to shake up the struggling economy .
the ldp is riddled with factions who rely on industries which might face closures or financial pain from reform for election funding .
but mr koizumi said all the party 's mps would be backing the platform , a new development in a political system where mps have traditionally rewritten party policy to match local biases .
privatisation among the promises that have been stalled for two years but now feature heavily are plans to sell off the postal savings system , whose trillions of yen in deposits have acted as vital investment seed capital for japan 's bureaucrats .
that is scheduled for 2007 , two years after the planned sell-off of the heavily-indebted highway agency .
japanese voters are unlikely to vote mr koizumi out of office , since the ldp has been in power for all but a handful of the past 48 years .
but the strength of his mandate from voters worried about stubbornly high unemployment , stagnant growth and a worryingly strong yen may dictate whether he will have to continue giving in to the anti-reform factions in the party .

newcastle city council is one of the largest local authorities ever to take part in the vote for life scheme .
and more people in the city have signed up for the scheme than in any other part of the country , according to organisers uk transplant .
the project asks people to join the nhs organ donor register -lrb- odr -rrb- to tackle the backlog of transplant operations .
registration forms from uk transplant were sent out to the city 's 200,000 homes , along with the electoral registration forms in august .
so far 13,000 completed forms have been returned to the council - most of them asking to register two people .
in july it was revealed that more than one million people in the north of england had registered as organ donors .
the number of people listed on the odr in the region has doubled over the past five years .
' fantastic response ' the response has been welcomed by patients and campaigners as fresh hope in combating the shortage of organs which is holding up transplant teams at newcastle hospitals .
peter sas , from uk transplant , said : " this is a fantastic response by the citizens of newcastle .
" it 's thanks to the generosity of people joining the organ donor register that someone 's life could be saved or greatly improved by transplant .
" newcastle seems to be heading for a record return . "
vote for life has encouraged 650,000 voters to pledge to help others after death since it started in 1999 .
a spokesman for newcastle city council said : " we are delighted with the phenomenal response we have has to vote for life .
" it is brilliant to see so many of the people of newcastle join the organ donor register giving the chance for someone else to live after their death and supporting such a worthwhile cause . "

newcastle city council is one of the largest local authorities ever to take part in the vote for life scheme .
and more people in the city have signed up for the scheme than in any other part of the country , according to organisers uk transplant .
the project asks people to join the nhs organ donor register -lrb- odr -rrb- to tackle the backlog of transplant operations .
registration forms from uk transplant were sent out to the city 's 200,000 homes , along with the electoral registration forms in august .
so far 13,000 completed forms have been returned to the council - most of them asking to register two people .
in july it was revealed that more than one million people in the north of england had registered as organ donors .
the number of people listed on the odr in the region has doubled over the past five years .
' fantastic response ' the response has been welcomed by patients and campaigners as fresh hope in combating the shortage of organs which is holding up transplant teams at newcastle hospitals .
peter sas , from uk transplant , said : " this is a fantastic response by the citizens of newcastle .
" it 's thanks to the generosity of people joining the organ donor register that someone 's life could be saved or greatly improved by transplant .
" newcastle seems to be heading for a record return . "
vote for life has encouraged 650,000 voters to pledge to help others after death since it started in 1999 .
a spokesman for newcastle city council said : " we are delighted with the phenomenal response we have has to vote for life .
" it is brilliant to see so many of the people of newcastle join the organ donor register giving the chance for someone else to live after their death and supporting such a worthwhile cause . "

he also said he was unlikely to embark on another stunt of this magnitude .
the american is nearing the end of his self-imposed fast , suspended by a crane near the river thames , and is due to leave his box on sunday .
speaking to cnn via a video link he said it had been " so much more difficult than anything else i have ever done " .
he added : " i do n't think i can do anything like this again . "
since the magician entered the perspex box on 5 september he has had to contend with a campaign of " blaine-baiting " with passers-by taunting him with egg throwing and constant noise .
but he told cnn that it was " to be expected " .
speaking about his stay , he said : " it 's been really cold , and when you are starving , your body only produces one-third of its heat .
" it 's been 40 degrees fahrenheit some nights .
it 's really hard to sit , and all of my muscles are really weak . "
moon and clouds this has been blaine 's most audacious stunt , having previously spent three days in a block of ice and 36 hours atop a pole .
although there is a certain amount of cynicism surrounding the feat , blaine denied it was all a trick .
" no , i am really here doing what i said i was going to do , " he said .
" i have never decided to do anything for this length of time .

after 10 years of takeovers , mergers and management shakeups , the 15 separate itv companies have finally been reduced to one , at least in england and wales .
the two scottish stations still have other owners , as do ulster and channel television , but in practical terms - programme production , commissioning and scheduling , and advertising sales - there will now be just one big itv company .

the deal is more generous to carlton , granada and its shareholders than anyone expected , which is why the city reacted so positively .

it can operate , in the words of one former itv boss , as " a proper television company " or , in greg dyke 's oft-quoted phrase , an 800-pound gorilla , competing with the two other giants of the tv jungle , the bbc and sky .
carlton and granada say a stronger itv is good news for viewers because the new company will be more singleminded and more money can be put into programmes , delivering better quality and choice .
in fact , they acknowledge that this year 's budget increase will be modest .
but a single itv was n't an end in itself and the merger marks the start of a new and uncertain phase for the uk 's largest commercial tv network .

analysts blame the pair for the itv digital debacle , which cost shareholders a billion pounds , and find it hard to believe they can work together , foreseeing them " fighting like ferrets in a sack " .
at the weekend , they challenged that notion .

the multi-million dollar legal battle is being followed by those who have worked in similar factories in scotland .
one group , from the national semiconductor plant in greenock , has already raised an action and believes that the ibm case could strengthen their hand .
