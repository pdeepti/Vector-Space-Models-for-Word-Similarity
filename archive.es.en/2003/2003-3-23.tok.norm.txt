" jihad in islam in meant to defend ... those subject to injustice , " he said .
" we have to support and defend the people of iraq . " " with all our heart and soul , we sacrifice ourselves to islam , " protesters chanted .
police beat back the 10,000 demonstrators with truncheons and water cannons . in a rare statement , egypt 's interior ministry appealed to citizens to express themselves in an orderly manner by participating only in previously authorized demonstrations . clashes kill two in the yemeni capital , sanaa , riot police in armored cars tried to prevent 30,000 protesters from marching on the u.s. embassy on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2003 arab world in turmoil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war protests are raging across the middle east .
with the streets of arab cities again filled with anti-war protesters , fears are growing that the protests could push the entire region into crisis . with the rise of middle eastern satellite news channels like al-jazeera and al-arabia , many arab countries now have access to far more information than their own , often heavily censored national media have supplied . both broadcasters have played a leading role in international coverage of the second gulf war .
on saturday , al-jazeera viewers faced images of mutilated corpses and injured children in iraq .
the satellite broadcaster even aired footage a decapitated child and a dead iraqi soldier laying next to a white flag in a trench .
al-jazeera also broadcast pictures of dozens of corpses in the kurdish dominated northern iraq .
the dead were allegedly fighters from the islamic extremist group ansar el islam , who had been killed by american soldiers . " did you see all those bombs falling on tv ?
all the poor people ?
and for what ?
america wants to subjugate the entire region for the sake of israel .
they want to bring the arabs to their knees , " a 50-year-old egyptian housewife told reuters . ironically , the new diversity of media is adding to the fury in the middle east over u.s.-led military strikes against iraq , with viewers being faced each day with a barrage of macabre images from the war that are often conspicuously absent from western coverage .
thousands have taken to the streets in massive and often-violent protests against the u.s. war on iraq . mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police block protesters from reaching the kuwaiti embassy in beirut , lebanon .
in countries from morocco to oman , arab populations have not only been expressing their anger at the united states and its closest ally , britain , but also widespread dissatisfaction with their own political leaders .
many believe that arab heads of state and the arab league did not do enough to prevent a war . analysts are divided on whether the sometimes violent protests could destabilize an already unstable region .

with the streets of arab cities again filled with anti-war protesters , fears are growing that the protests could push the entire region into crisis . with the rise of middle eastern satellite news channels like al-jazeera and al-arabia , many arab countries now have access to far more information than their own , often heavily censored national media have supplied . both broadcasters have played a leading role in international coverage of the second gulf war .
on saturday , al-jazeera viewers faced images of mutilated corpses and injured children in iraq .
the satellite broadcaster even aired footage a decapitated child and a dead iraqi soldier laying next to a white flag in a trench .
al-jazeera also broadcast pictures of dozens of corpses in the kurdish dominated northern iraq .
the dead were allegedly fighters from the islamic extremist group ansar el islam , who had been killed by american soldiers . " did you see all those bombs falling on tv ?
all the poor people ?
and for what ?
america wants to subjugate the entire region for the sake of israel .
they want to bring the arabs to their knees , " a 50-year-old egyptian housewife told reuters . ironically , the new diversity of media is adding to the fury in the middle east over u.s.-led military strikes against iraq , with viewers being faced each day with a barrage of macabre images from the war that are often conspicuously absent from western coverage .
thousands have taken to the streets in massive and often-violent protests against the u.s. war on iraq . mass protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police block protesters from reaching the kuwaiti embassy in beirut , lebanon .

many believe that arab heads of state and the arab league did not do enough to prevent a war . analysts are divided on whether the sometimes violent protests could destabilize an already unstable region .
but most believe that the tough security forces in the arab states will manage to keep the popular fury in check . in the egyptian capital , the region 's largest city with some 17 million inhabitants , 20,000 people took to the streets on saturday calling for an end to the u.s. and british-led fighting .

" we are with you and the people of iraq , " they chanted . on friday anti-war protests deteriorated into violent clashes with police after the evening prayers .
in many cities , muslim clerics fired up their congregations with sermons denouncing the war . mohammed sayed tantawi , the grand sheik of the historic al-azhar mosque in cairo , called for jihad - holy war - to support iraqis .
" jihad in islam in meant to defend ... those subject to injustice , " he said .
" we have to support and defend the people of iraq . " " with all our heart and soul , we sacrifice ourselves to islam , " protesters chanted .
police beat back the 10,000 demonstrators with truncheons and water cannons . in a rare statement , egypt 's interior ministry appealed to citizens to express themselves in an orderly manner by participating only in previously authorized demonstrations . clashes kill two in the yemeni capital , sanaa , riot police in armored cars tried to prevent 30,000 protesters from marching on the u.s. embassy on friday .
they used water cannons , tear gas and , finally , live ammunition .
an 11-year-old boy and at least one other protester were killed in the altercations .
reports that a third protester and a policemen had also been slain have not been confirmed .
at least nine marchers and 14 policemen were injured . saddam hussein targeted , too in addition to protesting against the u.s. , many also expressed their contempt for iraqi president saddam . in beirut , lebanon , grand ayatollah sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah denounced both the united states and saddam hussein in his friday sermon .
" we call on the iraqi people to topple the tyrant who has destroyed iraq and thrown the arab and islamic world into disarray , fadlallah , a shiite , said . the cleric added that he rejected " iraq 's occupation by the arrogant powers , particularly america . " in amman , jordan , hamza mansour , a cleric leader of the muslim brotherhood , urged 4,000 palestinian listeners to fight back with car bombs and martyr themselves .
police removed two imams from a mosque , worshippers reported .
they were said to have delivered fiery sermons . the jordanian authorities were met with angry demonstrators when they sealed off parts of the capital to prevent islamist organized pro-iraq protests .
numerous people were injured and several arrested in street fights in the wihdat neighborhood , an area where mainly palestinian refugees live . iraqi flags selling like hotcakes in another sign of how deeply entrenched anti-american sentiment has become in the palestinian-controlled territories , one shop owner told the news agency agence france presse that he was selling as many as 200 iraqi flags a day to customers .
flags of the countries that have taken a stance against the war - germany , france , russia , china and more - he said , are also flying off the shelves . compiled with material from wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global anger erupts as bombs batter baghdad even as bombs rained on the iraqi capital for the fourth day in a row , seething anger at the u.s.-led war spilled on to the streets in cities worldwide as thousands of demonstrators gathered to condemn american policy .
