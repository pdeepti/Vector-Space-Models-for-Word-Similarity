harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .
it was just for fun to pass away a few boring weeks during the summer vacation .
but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .
after six chapters had already appeared on the internet , and the appetite was wet for more , the hamburg-based publisher took legal action against koeleman , and a court served up an injunction forcing him to remove the amateur translation or face up to two years in jail or a fine of , at that time , dm 500,000 -lrb- € 255,600 -rrb- .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .

csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 harry potter speaks german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after launching in england in june , german readers are eager for their translation of the fifth harry potter book to arrive in bookstores .
harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "

based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 harry potter speaks german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after launching in england in june , german readers are eager for their translation of the fifth harry potter book to arrive in bookstores .
harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .
it was just for fun to pass away a few boring weeks during the summer vacation .
but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .
after six chapters had already appeared on the internet , and the appetite was wet for more , the hamburg-based publisher took legal action against koeleman , and a court served up an injunction forcing him to remove the amateur translation or face up to two years in jail or a fine of , at that time , dm 500,000 -lrb- € 255,600 -rrb- .
dishing out cucumber salad koeleman stopped publishing the content on the site and instead began placing what he called gurkensalat or " cucumber salad " on the pages for everyone to see .
the content was generated from really bad translations supplied by the community ’ s translators .
it ’ s still on the site available for anyone to read and snicker over .
and it serves as a distinct reminder of the publisher ’ s suppression of individual creativity and the efforts of a few crazed potter fans to bring their hero one step closer to their home . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links harry-auf-deutsch community web site with chats , forum and information on participating in the collective german translation of " harry potter and the order of the phoenix " - site only in german .

sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .
it was just for fun to pass away a few boring weeks during the summer vacation .
but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .
after six chapters had already appeared on the internet , and the appetite was wet for more , the hamburg-based publisher took legal action against koeleman , and a court served up an injunction forcing him to remove the amateur translation or face up to two years in jail or a fine of , at that time , dm 500,000 -lrb- € 255,600 -rrb- .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .

what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .

a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .

but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .

government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 harry potter speaks german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after launching in england in june , german readers are eager for their translation of the fifth harry potter book to arrive in bookstores .
harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .
it was just for fun to pass away a few boring weeks during the summer vacation .
but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .
after six chapters had already appeared on the internet , and the appetite was wet for more , the hamburg-based publisher took legal action against koeleman , and a court served up an injunction forcing him to remove the amateur translation or face up to two years in jail or a fine of , at that time , dm 500,000 -lrb- € 255,600 -rrb- .
dishing out cucumber salad koeleman stopped publishing the content on the site and instead began placing what he called gurkensalat or " cucumber salad " on the pages for everyone to see .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .

after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region . although no group has claimed responsibility for the deadly moscow suicide bombings which killed at least 16 and injured more than 40 at an open-air music festival on saturday afternoon , police and the russian interior ministry are nearly certain terrorists from the breakaway republic of chechnya were involved .
government officials have indicated the attacks were aimed at disrupting president vladimir putin ’ s peace plans for the war-torn republic .
the bombings – two separate detonations occurring a few minutes apart – were carried out by two women , who set off dynamite-laden belts strapped to their bodies , when they were denied access to the heavily-visited rock concert at moscow ’ s tuschino airport .
police said the women were detained at the festival ’ s entry because they had aroused the suspicion of security guards searching visitors .
had the women been able to actually enter the concert grounds , the effect of the bombs would have been considerably worse , said deputy interior minister rashid nurgaliyev on russia ’ s first channel news .
" i can only imagine what the consequences might have been " had they gotten into the main crowd , he said , adding that 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the concert .
link to chechen rebels almost immediately after the blasts , authorities began blaming chechen separatists for staging the attack .
according to nurgaliyev , the bombings carried all the markings typical of chechen terrorists .
both of the women wore bomb belts similar to those worn by the chechen terrorists , who took some 800 people hostage at a moscow theater last october , the deputy minister said .
plus , the fact that the suicide bombers were women resembles two earlier chechen attacks also carried out by women in may .
underlining the connection , police at the crime scene on saturday said they had recovered an identity card from the body of one of the suicide bombers .
it was issued in the name of zlikhan likhajiyeva , 20 , a resident of the chechan village kurchaloi .
a spokesperson for chechen rebel leader aslan maschadov , however , denied the group ’ s involvement in the moscow attack .
a resurgence of chechen violence since russia sent troops to the breakaway republic of chechnya in 1994 , the region has been ripped apart by violenence as the mainly muslim state in the southern caucuses fights to sever itself from moscow .
in may and june of this year alone , some 50 people were killed in a wave of chechen-launched terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and acting chechen president akhmad kadyrov shake hands during a meeting at the kremlin in moscow .
government officials said saturday ’ s bombings were the latest in the series of deadly attacks designed by chechen separatists to interfere with moscow ’ s peace plans for the region .
they point to the fact that the explosions occurred only a few hours after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree calling for kremlin-run elections to take place in chechnya on october 5 .
" it ’ s obvious that the goal of the explosions which terrorists carried out ... were the planned elections for the president and the parliament of the republic -lsb- of chechnya -rsb- , " putin ’ s special representative for human rights in chechnya , abdul-khakim sultygov , told russian interfax news agency on sunday .
sultygov , however , vowed that the elections would go ahead as planned and stressed that it was not possible to disrupt the peace process " by the forces of international terrorism and their allies . "
president putin launched the chechen peace plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but separatist rebels , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected the peace initiative and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military and gain independence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide bombers strike in moscow at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .

harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .
so they ’ ve set about to translate it themselves – over the internet . harry potter fans the world over rejoiced when j.k. rowling ’ s fifth book about the clever young wizard finally appeared in june after a three-year hiatus .
but harry potter and the order of the phoenix has only come out in english so far .
in germany , the official translation is not scheduled to arrive on the market until nov .
8 .
that ’ s a long time for those bitten with potter-mania .
so what are the impatient german readers doing ?
they ’ re applying a little bit of magic , a lot of inspiration and some pretty impressive interpretive skills to whip together their own unofficial , non-commercial translation of the book .
and it ’ s all being done on the internet , where every curious potter fan can take a peek into the latest round of harry 's adventures .
a bring-your-own potter party at " harry-auf-deutsch.de " german readers with a good understanding of english and a love of the harry potter books - not to mention a good sense of creativity in tackling unusual and at times nonsensical words – can take a stab at translating rowling ’ s original english version .
so far some 1,000 hp fans , as they call themselves , have worked on the translation of book five in the hopes of soon being able to read the final unofficial version .
but it ’ s a bring-your-own potter party .
that means the only people who actually get to read the final internet version have to contribute something to the work itself .
most participate in translation , taking a chapter at a time from a list available on the site .
some offer their editing and proofreading services , and still others help manage the web page and coordinate emails .
as a reward for usable efforts , the contributors receive a copy of all successive chapters per email installment .
although a few blitz-translators have already put together one finished version of the order of the phoenix , the harry-auf-deutsch team is still encouraging fans to participate in the collective translation , saying the more people who participate , the better the end result will be .
bernd koeleman , the web site ’ s administrator , stresses in the forum that speed is not everything .
the idea , he writes , is to " encourage as many people as possible to read the original and to inspire communication and fun with translation as well as creating new modes of collective open-content work on the internet . "
what ’ s a crumple-horned snorkack ?
based on the dozens of entries in the community forum , the translation project is generating quite a bit of interest from would-be english-german translators .
from students just struggling through their third year of school english to professional-like whizzes , participants carry on a lively exchange about correct translation of common english words like " diversion " and " patronize " and the very british " blimey . "
they also debate accurate punctuation for german quotations and whether or not to leave proper nouns in their original english .
of course the most extensive exchange gets going when someone starts pondering the best translation for typical hp vocabulary like " squib " -lrb- for non-initiated hp readers , that ’ s someone whose parents are wizards but hasn ’ t inherited any of the powers -rrb- and " extendable ears " -lrb- they are what they seem , but conveying that in german is apparently not so easy -rrb- .
and the verdict is still out on how to translate " crumple-horned snorkack . "
a learning process the whole idea for the harry-auf-deutsch translation community first got started when bernd koeleman ’ s 14-year-old daughter picked up a bound copy of the fourth book and together with a few friends began translating it .
it was just for fun to pass away a few boring weeks during the summer vacation .
but then her father , a computer expert , got involved and started recruiting a few more potter enthusiasts over the internet and soon the web site was born .
the whole process of collective translation on the internet proved successful in 2001 when the harry-auf-deutsch community tried its hand on the fourth potter book , publishing its efforts on the internet for anyone to download .
in fact , it was so popular that the german publishing house carlsen verlag , which was scheduled to bring the book out slightly later than the non-commercial web site , got worried about copyright violations and ordered the site to be shut down .
after six chapters had already appeared on the internet , and the appetite was wet for more , the hamburg-based publisher took legal action against koeleman , and a court served up an injunction forcing him to remove the amateur translation or face up to two years in jail or a fine of , at that time , dm 500,000 -lrb- € 255,600 -rrb- .
dishing out cucumber salad koeleman stopped publishing the content on the site and instead began placing what he called gurkensalat or " cucumber salad " on the pages for everyone to see .
the content was generated from really bad translations supplied by the community ’ s translators .
it ’ s still on the site available for anyone to read and snicker over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2003 tour de france turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france has turned into a major media event .
in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .
it 's also produced at least one german winner . on july 1 , 1903 , 60 cyclists embarked on the first-ever tour de france from the parisian suburb of montgeron .
the first segment of the trip was a 467 kilometer -lrb- 290 mile -rrb- stretch , nearly twice the distance of a single stage today .
the event got its start as a publicity gimmick for the french sporting magazine l 'auto -lrb- today 's l 'èquipe -rrb- , but it eventually grew into the world 's preeminent cycling race and one of the top sporting events – producing both heroic moments and legendary athletes , not to mention helping the magazine reach its desired circulation goals .
this sunday , the event will celebrate its centennial as racers peddle their way from paris to the alps and from the pyrenees to the atlantic , beating sweltering heat and the harsh elements before wending their way back to the french capital .
by the time the race ends on july 27 , riders will have completed 20 stages and covered 3,427.5 kilometers of terrain .
and during the 90th race , they will reflect on the event 's history - which has been nearly as rich as that of the olympics .
some of the most colorful athletic memories at the tour de france have come from an elite group of racers who each won the event at least five times .
from the ' 50s to the mid- ' 60s , frenchman jacques anquetil dominated the race , and from the end of the ' 60s through the mid- ' 70s , belgian eddy merckx headed the pack .
from the late ' 70s through the mid- ' 80s , frenchman bernhard hinault was almost always first to cross the line , and in the ' 90s , the event belonged to spanish cyclist miguel indurain .
last year , american cyclist lance armstrong won his fifth victory .
germans on tour germany , too , has written tour de france history , even if it has only produced a single winner in 100 years .
in 1932 , kurt stöpel took second place .
and in 1977 , the then 22-year old dietricht " didi " thurau rode in first place with the yellow jersey for more than two weeks , not losing it until the race climbed its way into the alps .
" if i had had a little more experience , i think i could have won that race , " thurau recalls .
" but things turned out differently .
still , it was great to be able to wear the yellow jersey for 15 days and such huge euphoria broke out in germany .
it could hardly have gone any better . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich in the end , thurau came in fifth place .
the first german victor came along 20 years later , when jan ullrich -lrb- photo -rrb- celebrated his tour de france win along the champs elysee in paris in 1997 .
" it 's an incredible feeling to ride along the champs elysee , " ullrich remembers .
" i had goosebumps .
the kilometers passed by so incredibly quickly .
at first i could n't believe i had won .
instead i looked at my front and back tires to see if i had broken a spoke .
i was afraid something would break or that i 'd have an accident .
it took me a little bit of time to realize -lsb- that i had won -rsb- . "
but ullrich and thurau aren ’ t the only germans to make their mark on the tour de france .
in 1962 , rudi altig became the first german to wear the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent finisher in all 21 stages .
he was followed in 1990 by olaf ludwig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany wears the green jersey jubilates after the first stage of the tour de france july 7 , 2002 .
record-winning sprinter erik zabel donned the green jersey for six years in a row between 1996 and 2001 .
but last year he lost it to australian robbie mcewen .
this year , he 's taking that loss in stride .
" i had already won six times and felt like i was untouchable , " he says .
" for the next tour i hope to win again – and to enter into the race in good condition and the necessary freshness .
and , of course , i have an advantage that will make it less stressful : i 'm not in the position of having to defend my jersey . "
but germany 's greatest hope for this year may again rest with jan ullrich , who is competing in the race for the first time since he was sidelined after having knee surgery and getting caught using ecstasy .
highs and lows of course the tour 's 100-year history hasn ’ t been without its scandals .
as far back as 1904 , race organizers had to disqualify one cyclist after discovering that he had completed some of the stretches by train or car .
and there were even doping problems to cope with in the early years , the most dramatic of them ending in death .
tom simpson , a brit , died during the 1967 event while ascending one of the most challenging stretches on the route : mount ventoux .
he had pumped himself full of amphetamines and alcohol and , quite literally , pushed his body to the limit .
" tom simpson fell for the first time during the first ascent of mount ventoux , " recollects rolf wolfshohl , a german cyclist who was racing as part of simpson 's group .
" people helped him back on his bike two or three times and pushed him along .
he just rode along apathetically .
but in the end he could n't go any further and he had to be evacuated by helicopter .
he was announced dead on arrival at the hospital . "
doping troubles tour de france doping scandals hit their lowest point in 1998 .
that year french cyclist richard virenque 's festina team was disqualified from the race after border police discovered doping substances in the car of one of the team 's crew .
the discovery led to raids throughout the event – and some teams even fled across the border to avoid getting caught or merely boycotted the rest of the race .
german cyclist jens voigt recalls the event angrily .
" we 're just cyclists – it was n't like we had been accused of anything or that we had committed any kind of bad crime .
but we were treated like criminals , " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans having lunch by the road wave as the pack rides past on july 7 , 2002 .
there were other memories , too , including some humorous ones .
in 1950 , after taking the lead , algerian racer abdelkader zaaf stopped by a sidewalk cafe and emptied two bottles of wine to quench his thirst .
after sleeping off his stupor under a tree , he started back on the course hours later but went in the wrong direction – right back to the starting line .
but somehow , even with the scandals , the popularity of the race just keeps growing stronger .
and even though technology continues to enhance the equipment used by riders and sports science continues to improve the way they train , it 's still one of the world 's biggest sporting challenges .
" people always say that the race has gotten easier , " says ferdi kübler of switzerland , the oldest living winner of the tour de france .
" but it 's just changed .
people have more and better materials , they have more masseurs and mechanics .
the care is also much better .
they can even be fed in cars .
we could n't do any of that .
but in my opinion it is still the most difficult sport in the world .

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .

and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .
so this signal is important , it says the big names in business are on our side . "

the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .

as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .

the city is looking to make money off the giant festival . each city in germany has its big summer festivals .
kiel has the kielerwoche , berlin has the love parade , and cologne has its christopher street day .
and each city invests large sums of money in the events ’ marketing , in the hopes of attracting tourists from across the country and throughout europe to come spend a few days and lots of euros .
the three-day gay and lesbian street festival in cologne is no different than any of the other giant parties in this regard .
culminating in a colorful parade on july 6 , the csd celebration is the mid-summer highlight for the city on the rhine .
next to karneval and the popkomm music festival , csd is cologne ’ s third largest event .
it attracts approximately one million tourists a year and generates profits well over the million euro mark .
more than gay and lesbian awareness cologne ’ s christopher street day parade is europe ’ s biggest gay and lesbian festival , and according to the event ’ s organizers one of the world ’ s largest .
but for the majority of cologne residents , the parade is much more than a show of support for the gay and lesbian community .
as in years past , hundreds of thousands of people line cologne ’ s streets to watch the dancers in bright feather costumes and skimpy leather outfits make their way through the city ’ s center .
in the course of its 11-year existence , the cologne csd parade has become more than a colorful spectacle to remind people of the violent 1969 suppression of the greenwich village gay protest .
it has grown into a major financial resource for the city ’ s economy .
a million visitors = a million euro in the course of just a few years , the gay and lesbian karneval , as the cologne residents refer to csd , has advanced from a relatively modest demonstration to a massive city-wide commercial undertaking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in cologne 's christopher street day parade pose on july 6 , 2003 , in front of the city 's cathedral .
around 750,000 people attend the annual event and many travel from beyond the cologne region , according to the official csd web page . and a few hundred thousand tourists translates into big money for the city 's businesses .
for the event ’ s organizers , it means csd has become an accepted , and even important , factor in the cologne business community " the fact that we manage to attract so many people to the event opens the doors to meetings with key business partners , " last year 's marketing and business advisor michael schmidt told deutsche welle .
and these in turn help promote csd , he said .
city marketing two years ago , the city launched a massive advertising campaign designed to attract visitors from europe and north america to the pride festivities on the rhine .
the city ’ s treasurers set aside 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 17,400 -rrb- specifically for the campaign targeting homosexuals .
as part of the advertisement , for instance , the city ’ s tourist board sponsored month-long ads in french lesbian magazines and dutch gay newspapers for spending a weekend in " germany ’ s gay and lesbian capital . "
since then the city has set its hopes on reaping the profits from a high homosexual tourist turnout .
cologne ’ s tourism manager günter wiencke said csd is " big business " for the city .
" based on studies in other cities , we can assume that every visitor who comes to cologne for this event spends at least € 75 .
when we multiply that amount by a million visitors , we have a sum in the three-figure million range .
that ’ s an impressive number , and one which the city profits from not only in the long term , but also immediately , " wiencke explained .
wiencke added that the city gains money off of each item sold during the three-day event , from clothing to food and beverages to hotel rooms .
" a portion of the profits made during this time ends up as sales tax in the city ’ s coffers . "
lucrative marketing the concept of making money by targeting gays and lesbians is nothing new to the business community .
in cologne , several big companies form an impressive list of official csd sponsors , hoping to cash in on the lucrative profit margins .
ford , coca cola , deutsche ba , west cigarettes and avis car rental all donate money to the event .
they place their company logos on brochures , the csd web sites , and parade floats , as well as sponsor stands at the various parade venues .
among these businesses , the cologne-based ford automobile factory is one of the most active sponsors .
its logo , for instance , is placed prominently on the csd web page every year .
ford factory workers are also actively involved in the csd event itself .
since 1994 , gay and lesbian employees have participated in the parade , and they have even formed a homosexual works council .
over the course of several years supporting the parade , the motor company has come to recognize the advantages of marketing specifically to gay and lesbian consumers .
frank niewöhner , a member of ford ’ s product marketing team , told deutsche welle that germany ’ s homosexual population represents a significant purchasing power .
" statistically , we ’ re talking about five to ten percent of the population in germany , and that ’ s a very , very big group .
there are studies that say this target group has a high household spending budget because they frequently don ’ t have children .
we also know that gays and lesbians tend to live in large cities and that they like to go out and have fun . "
csd organizers emphasize these characteristics on their web site and offer to help sponsors reach out directly to a consumer-friendly , travel-happy and brand-oriented target group . they call this specific audience gay urban trendsetters , or guts for short .
for companies like ford that market products designed to appeal to a young and trendy consumer group , profits can be lucrative , not only for the three days of csd , but in the long run .
a company that sponsors the csd parade signals to gays and lesbians that it supports their lifestyle and values their business , csd marketing organizers suggest on their internet site . this can go a long way to winning over dedicated customers .
business and csd go hand-in-hand the christopher street day organizers have no problem with the fact that sponsors are looking to make money off the gay and lesbian participants .
in fact , they rely on these big-name companies to provide the much needed finances to run the event .
aside from the cologne tourism campaign , the city does not contribute a single euro to the event ; all the funds come from private donations and sponsors .
michael schmidt estimated last year that the three-day festivities cost approximately € 650,000 .
a third of this money came from official sponsors , of which ford was the largest .
the rest of the money came from private individuals .
" when companies like ford or coca cola work together with us on csd , it sends out a positive signal to society , " schmidt said .
" and that ’ s important to us .
we ’ ve not come to the point yet , where we are fully accepted and can live as equals in this society .

interior minister boris gryzlov said a chechen passport had been found on one of the two female bombers who blew themselves up during the giant show at the tushino airfield in north-western moscow .
but a chechen spokesman , salambek maigov , told a russian radio station that the leadership of his homeland was not involved .
the united states has condemned the attack , saying in a statement that " no cause justifies terrorism " and that " the civilised nations of the world will prevail " in the fight against terror . "
at first i thought it was a giant firecracker , then i realised it was an explosion " eyewitness several moscow clinics have been kept busy overnight treating patients with shrapnel wounds and severe burns , some of whom are in critical condition .
medics have warned that the death toll could rise further .
no one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , but mr gryzlov suggested that it was linked to friday 's decision by president vladimir putin to hold presidential election in chechnya on 5 october .
" i presume that this inhumane situation , this terrorist act , is linked with the staging of this event , " mr gryzlov said .
however , the bbc 's russian affairs analyst stephen dalziel says there is unlikely to be a direct link , given that an attack of this nature would need considerable planning .
president putin offered his condolences to the victims ' families and vowed that such acts by what he called a small hard core group of fighters would not throw him off course .
packed with nails the all-day krylya -lrb- wings -rrb- festival - a popular summer event for young music fans festival featuring many of russia 's most popular bands - was packed with a crowd of about 40,000 people when the bombs went off .
the first blast happened as people queued near the concert entrance at 1439 local time -lrb- 1039 gmt -rrb- on saturday .
a woman detonated an explosives belt near an admissions booth when police tried to stop her entering .
police say she was killed outright along with one other person and that many others were injured .
although the authorities say that it could have been much worse since the bomb belt failed to explode properly .
fifteen minutes later there was a second , more powerful explosion as another female bomber blew herself up just metres from the main entrance . "
if the ' war on terrorism ' is really a justified war , then russia deserves our support " mike , us the bbc 's correspondent in moscow sarah rainsford said that most of the victims were killed in the second blast .
one witness said that after the first blast police told spectators to leave by the other gate - where the second bomb went off .
both bombs had been stuffed with screws and nails , intended to cause maximum damage .
" at first i thought it was a giant firecracker , then i realised it was an explosion , " eyewitness vadim trushkin told the associated press news agency .
mobile calls blocked rescue teams were flown in by helicopter and the wounded taken to nearby hospitals .

our correspondent said that as panic reigned on the streets outside , many festival-goers inside the air base remained unaware of events .
the organisers decreed that to avoid a panic stampede the show must go on and did not make any announcement about the incident , allowing the performances to proceed .
the bbc 's nikolai gorshkov said that the authorities blocked all mobile telephone calls to the area to allow the audience to enjoy the rest of the concert oblivious of the carnage .
then the concert goers were slowly evacuated onto waiting coaches .
terror fears our correspondent sarah rainsford says events connected with chechnya will be strongly in people 's minds after saturday 's blasts .
there have been heightened fears of attacks by chechen militants since the hostage siege at a moscow theatre last year .
that resulted in the death of 129 hostages and 41 rebels , who had included women armed with explosive belts , after russian special forces used noxious gas to disable the hostage-takers .

the official beijing morning news said more than 40 miners were trapped inside the mine when the blast occurred early on friday .
fifteen were rescued unharmed .
officials said that the yakeshi mine , about 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 600 miles -rrb- northeast of beijing , was government-owned and had operated legally since 1985 .
chinese coal mines have the worst safety record in the world .
official figures indicate more than 5,000 people were killed last year alone , while other estimates suggest the figure could be much higher .
such explosions are usually caused by the accidental ignition of gas that seeps from the coal and builds up due to poor ventilation .
in may , more than 70 people died in a gas explosion at a mine in eastern china .
many such incidents occur in privately owned mines , which lack operating licences and adequate safety equipment .
china relies heavily on the coal industry for its energy needs .

fifteen were rescued unharmed .
officials said that the yakeshi mine , about 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 600 miles -rrb- northeast of beijing , was government-owned and had operated legally since 1985 .
chinese coal mines have the worst safety record in the world .
official figures indicate more than 5,000 people were killed last year alone , while other estimates suggest the figure could be much higher .
such explosions are usually caused by the accidental ignition of gas that seeps from the coal and builds up due to poor ventilation .
in may , more than 70 people died in a gas explosion at a mine in eastern china .
many such incidents occur in privately owned mines , which lack operating licences and adequate safety equipment .
china relies heavily on the coal industry for its energy needs .

the police officer in charge of marshalling the parade said he is confident those on both sides urging calm have been listened to .
but in the town centre of nearby portadown where the march starts , people are less sure .
on the eve of the march , the town 's bustling shopping streets were quieter than usual .
many people are away on holiday .
saturday marked the start of the traditional 12th fortnight .
but it was not just that .
there was also tension in the air .
it might be less than usual , but it was there .
one woman carrying shopping bags said cafes were empty and mentioned the local holiday .
it 's just like the 4th of july is for the americans - except a few people do n't like it portadown resident " the catholics will have gone away , " she said .
she said , in a whisper under her breath , it was because of the " troubles " .
she added she thought people were tense .
" they say it 's quiet now but anything could happen . "
she did not want to be named because , she said , someone would come round and " put in my windows " .
for the protestant townsfolk , the parade season is there to be enjoyed .
the violence and division which sometimes accompany it is shrugged off .
why optimism this year ?
" i live near the garvaghy road and i 'll go out to watch the parade like every year , " said one woman in her 70s , working behind the counter of the oxfam charity shop .
" i do n't know what the fuss is about .
it 's been the same for 30 to 40 years - we all -lrb- catholics and protestants -rrb- get on with each other . "
" you get fighting at lots of big events , " said a 64-year-old woman , whose husband and son were both orangemen .
" it 's a minority of troublemakers , not the men in the parade themselves .
vibrant " it just like the 4th of july is for the americans - except a few people do n't like it . "
for the two weeks running up the 12 july , portadown and the loyalist areas of drumcree are festooned with red , white and blue bunting and flags .
a bridge wall is marked with loyalists ' red , white and blue around drumcree parish church there are green fields and nearby , new houses with neat gardens .
armoured vehicles and lorries carting concrete blocks for the barrier at the end of the road spoiled the view on saturday .
it would have been clear the day before , when a couple chose the church - which has become a focal point for the loyalists ' clashes with police - for their wedding .
portadown itself is a vibrant , if slightly rundown town .
there are the usual high street shops - thornton 's , top shop and boots - plus an unusually high number of cobblers , key cutters and jewellers .
the parade starts at the orange hall and makes its way to drumcree surrounded by fields , a smell of slurry pervades the air at this time of year .
the sweetest smelling place in fact , are the town 's public toilets which are astoundingly upmarket and clean .
with britain 's best loo certificates pinned proudly to the entrance , there is a 10p charge to spend a penny .
on saturday , the caretaker was having a slow day .
" it 's that time of the year .
everybody is holding their breath and waiting to see what happens .

the parade starts at the orange hall and makes its way to drumcree surrounded by fields , a smell of slurry pervades the air at this time of year .
the sweetest smelling place in fact , are the town 's public toilets which are astoundingly upmarket and clean .
with britain 's best loo certificates pinned proudly to the entrance , there is a 10p charge to spend a penny .
on saturday , the caretaker was having a slow day .
" it 's that time of the year .
everybody is holding their breath and waiting to see what happens .

the twins originate from a single fertilised egg , so they are always identical and of the same sex .
the developing embryo starts to split into identical twins within the first two weeks after conception .
however , the process stops before it is complete , leaving a partially separated egg which develops into a conjoined foetus .
the birth of two connected babies can be extremely traumatic and approximately 40-60 % of these births are delivered stillborn with 35 % surviving just one day .
the overall survival rate of conjoined twins is somewhere between 5 % and 25 % .
historical records over the past 500 years detail about 600 surviving sets of conjoined twins with more than 70 % of those surviving pairs resulting in female twins .
if they have separate sets of organs , chances for surgery and survival are greater than if they share the same organs .
conjoined twins are generally classified three ways : 73 % are connected at mid torso -lrb- at the chest wall or upper abdomen -rrb- 23 % at lower torso -lrb- sharing hips , legs or genitalia -rrb- 4 % at upper torso -lrb- connected at the head -rrb- over the years , survival rates have improved as a result of more accurate imaging studies and better anaesthetic and operative techniques .
the term siamese twins was coined as a reference to eng and chang bunker , who achieved international fame following their birth in what was then siam in 1811 .
they were exhibited in circus side shows around the world before settling in the united states and marrying two sisters .
they lived 63 years , with chang fathering 12 children and eng 10 .
in the uk an annual celebration was held for centuries to commemorate 12th century siamese twins mary and eliza chalkhurst , wealthy sisters who bequeathed a fortune to the church .
