prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .
names of defendants withheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann prosecutors did not immediately release the names of the accused because the six had not received copies of the charges . but the case has the potential of becoming one of germany 's biggest business crime cases because some leading members of germany 's business and union communities are among those who have been under investigation .
the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .

all is not well at media giant bertelsmann since the family owners suddenly pulled in the reins on management .
chairman gerd schulte-hillen has warned them to stop interfering . tensions are running high at europe 's biggest media firm , bertelsmann since a row erupted last week between supervisory board chairman gerd schulte-hillen and the founding mohn family . the trouble began when bertelsmann founder reinhard mohn attacked the firm 's managers , who run a media empire including the leading german television channel rtl , the publisher random house and the bmg record label . in an essay published on sunday in the weekly welt am sonntag , 81-year-old reinhard mohn said some of the company 's managers had priorities at odds with bertelmann 's best interests . although he had earlier made public his intention to limit family influence over the company after his death , he suddenly announced that his wife liz would take an active role in the firm 's activities .
the family retains majority voting rights at bertelsmann . backlash from managers supervisory board chairman schulte-hillen hit straight back , telling the mohn dynasty to stop interfering in the day-to-day running of the organization . " should the family increase its influence , as mohn intends to , the risk of misguided decisions will not decrease , " he told the news magazine der spiegel early this week . and if mohn was " refuting decades of loyal and successful management " in an attempt to justify greater family influence , then this would be " not fair and not appropriate , " former ceo of 16 years mark wössner told the german newsweekly focus . bringing bertelsmann back to its roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn the mohn family has not taken an active interest in the firm for years .
reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- stepped down as operative head when he was 60 .
at 70 , he left the company board to concentrate on running the bertelsmann foundation - the majority stake holder and chief beneficiary of the group 's profits - and started writing business-related books . last week mohn published his latest offering : " the social responsibility of entrepreneurs . " but after the media boom in the late 1990s , the company began to backslide , and the mohn dynasty decided it was time to change strategy .
in july 2002 , then ceo thomas middelhoff was ousted after pursuing an aggressive management style and planning to make bertelsmann public offering in 2005 .
the conservative mohn family objected to middelhof 's strategy and replaced him with gunter thielen , described as a man loyal to the company who enjoyed the kind of trust from the mohn family that middelhoff never did . who 's in charge ? but although reinhard mohn has named his wife - 20 years his junior - the family 's representative at bertelsmann , it is unclear what this will actually mean .
" -lsb- i am -rsb- neither secretly nor officially the ruler of bertelsmann , " liz mohn told the german news channel , n-tv last week . but with a seat on the board alongside two of her children and calls for executives to have " strength , character , modesty and integrity , " liz mohn is not to be underestimated . whether what insiders at the company are describing as " open warfare " will result in the return of bertelsmann to an inward-looking media dynasty is uncertain .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .
names of defendants withheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann prosecutors did not immediately release the names of the accused because the six had not received copies of the charges . but the case has the potential of becoming one of germany 's biggest business crime cases because some leading members of germany 's business and union communities are among those who have been under investigation .
the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel ackermann and zwickel have been under investigation because they served as members of the mannesmann board that approved the payments .
after learning earlier this month that an indictment was likely , ackermann defended the payments and said he would not resign if charges were filed .
esser maintains innocence esser reacted angrily to the indicment .
" there is not one shred of evidence showing i committed a crime , " he said .
he also is seeking damages in a lawsuit against the prosecutor 's office because he argues that prosecutors had no legitimate reason for opening their investigation .

all is not well at media giant bertelsmann since the family owners suddenly pulled in the reins on management .
chairman gerd schulte-hillen has warned them to stop interfering . tensions are running high at europe 's biggest media firm , bertelsmann since a row erupted last week between supervisory board chairman gerd schulte-hillen and the founding mohn family . the trouble began when bertelsmann founder reinhard mohn attacked the firm 's managers , who run a media empire including the leading german television channel rtl , the publisher random house and the bmg record label . in an essay published on sunday in the weekly welt am sonntag , 81-year-old reinhard mohn said some of the company 's managers had priorities at odds with bertelmann 's best interests . although he had earlier made public his intention to limit family influence over the company after his death , he suddenly announced that his wife liz would take an active role in the firm 's activities .
the family retains majority voting rights at bertelsmann . backlash from managers supervisory board chairman schulte-hillen hit straight back , telling the mohn dynasty to stop interfering in the day-to-day running of the organization . " should the family increase its influence , as mohn intends to , the risk of misguided decisions will not decrease , " he told the news magazine der spiegel early this week . and if mohn was " refuting decades of loyal and successful management " in an attempt to justify greater family influence , then this would be " not fair and not appropriate , " former ceo of 16 years mark wössner told the german newsweekly focus . bringing bertelsmann back to its roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn the mohn family has not taken an active interest in the firm for years .
reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- stepped down as operative head when he was 60 .
at 70 , he left the company board to concentrate on running the bertelsmann foundation - the majority stake holder and chief beneficiary of the group 's profits - and started writing business-related books . last week mohn published his latest offering : " the social responsibility of entrepreneurs . " but after the media boom in the late 1990s , the company began to backslide , and the mohn dynasty decided it was time to change strategy .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .
names of defendants withheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann prosecutors did not immediately release the names of the accused because the six had not received copies of the charges . but the case has the potential of becoming one of germany 's biggest business crime cases because some leading members of germany 's business and union communities are among those who have been under investigation .
the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .
names of defendants withheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann prosecutors did not immediately release the names of the accused because the six had not received copies of the charges . but the case has the potential of becoming one of germany 's biggest business crime cases because some leading members of germany 's business and union communities are among those who have been under investigation .
the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .

chairman gerd schulte-hillen has warned them to stop interfering . tensions are running high at europe 's biggest media firm , bertelsmann since a row erupted last week between supervisory board chairman gerd schulte-hillen and the founding mohn family . the trouble began when bertelsmann founder reinhard mohn attacked the firm 's managers , who run a media empire including the leading german television channel rtl , the publisher random house and the bmg record label . in an essay published on sunday in the weekly welt am sonntag , 81-year-old reinhard mohn said some of the company 's managers had priorities at odds with bertelmann 's best interests . although he had earlier made public his intention to limit family influence over the company after his death , he suddenly announced that his wife liz would take an active role in the firm 's activities .
the family retains majority voting rights at bertelsmann . backlash from managers supervisory board chairman schulte-hillen hit straight back , telling the mohn dynasty to stop interfering in the day-to-day running of the organization . " should the family increase its influence , as mohn intends to , the risk of misguided decisions will not decrease , " he told the news magazine der spiegel early this week . and if mohn was " refuting decades of loyal and successful management " in an attempt to justify greater family influence , then this would be " not fair and not appropriate , " former ceo of 16 years mark wössner told the german newsweekly focus . bringing bertelsmann back to its roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn the mohn family has not taken an active interest in the firm for years .
reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- stepped down as operative head when he was 60 .
at 70 , he left the company board to concentrate on running the bertelsmann foundation - the majority stake holder and chief beneficiary of the group 's profits - and started writing business-related books . last week mohn published his latest offering : " the social responsibility of entrepreneurs . " but after the media boom in the late 1990s , the company began to backslide , and the mohn dynasty decided it was time to change strategy .
in july 2002 , then ceo thomas middelhoff was ousted after pursuing an aggressive management style and planning to make bertelsmann public offering in 2005 .
the conservative mohn family objected to middelhof 's strategy and replaced him with gunter thielen , described as a man loyal to the company who enjoyed the kind of trust from the mohn family that middelhoff never did . who 's in charge ? but although reinhard mohn has named his wife - 20 years his junior - the family 's representative at bertelsmann , it is unclear what this will actually mean .
" -lsb- i am -rsb- neither secretly nor officially the ruler of bertelsmann , " liz mohn told the german news channel , n-tv last week . but with a seat on the board alongside two of her children and calls for executives to have " strength , character , modesty and integrity , " liz mohn is not to be underestimated . whether what insiders at the company are describing as " open warfare " will result in the return of bertelsmann to an inward-looking media dynasty is uncertain .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .

all is not well at media giant bertelsmann since the family owners suddenly pulled in the reins on management .
chairman gerd schulte-hillen has warned them to stop interfering . tensions are running high at europe 's biggest media firm , bertelsmann since a row erupted last week between supervisory board chairman gerd schulte-hillen and the founding mohn family . the trouble began when bertelsmann founder reinhard mohn attacked the firm 's managers , who run a media empire including the leading german television channel rtl , the publisher random house and the bmg record label . in an essay published on sunday in the weekly welt am sonntag , 81-year-old reinhard mohn said some of the company 's managers had priorities at odds with bertelmann 's best interests . although he had earlier made public his intention to limit family influence over the company after his death , he suddenly announced that his wife liz would take an active role in the firm 's activities .
the family retains majority voting rights at bertelsmann . backlash from managers supervisory board chairman schulte-hillen hit straight back , telling the mohn dynasty to stop interfering in the day-to-day running of the organization . " should the family increase its influence , as mohn intends to , the risk of misguided decisions will not decrease , " he told the news magazine der spiegel early this week . and if mohn was " refuting decades of loyal and successful management " in an attempt to justify greater family influence , then this would be " not fair and not appropriate , " former ceo of 16 years mark wössner told the german newsweekly focus . bringing bertelsmann back to its roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn the mohn family has not taken an active interest in the firm for years .
reinhard mohn -lrb- photo -rrb- stepped down as operative head when he was 60 .
at 70 , he left the company board to concentrate on running the bertelsmann foundation - the majority stake holder and chief beneficiary of the group 's profits - and started writing business-related books . last week mohn published his latest offering : " the social responsibility of entrepreneurs . " but after the media boom in the late 1990s , the company began to backslide , and the mohn dynasty decided it was time to change strategy .
in july 2002 , then ceo thomas middelhoff was ousted after pursuing an aggressive management style and planning to make bertelsmann public offering in 2005 .
the conservative mohn family objected to middelhof 's strategy and replaced him with gunter thielen , described as a man loyal to the company who enjoyed the kind of trust from the mohn family that middelhoff never did . who 's in charge ? but although reinhard mohn has named his wife - 20 years his junior - the family 's representative at bertelsmann , it is unclear what this will actually mean .
" -lsb- i am -rsb- neither secretly nor officially the ruler of bertelsmann , " liz mohn told the german news channel , n-tv last week . but with a seat on the board alongside two of her children and calls for executives to have " strength , character , modesty and integrity , " liz mohn is not to be underestimated . whether what insiders at the company are describing as " open warfare " will result in the return of bertelsmann to an inward-looking media dynasty is uncertain .
asked by der spiegel whether greater influence by the mohn family would cause the company to implode , schulte-hillen said , " this is not necessarily a certainty , but we can not exclude it either , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right man at the right time thomas middelhoff , chief of german publishing giant bertelsmann was the right man for the booming media market of the late 1990s .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .

the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .

prosecutors in düsseldorf have ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments over severance packages paid in vodafone 's successful hostile takeover . the takeover battle filled pages and pages of german newspapers in the fall of 1999 as the british telecommunication giant vodafone fought to take over the german mannesmann company and mannesmann battled to maintain its indepedence .
vodafone , led by chairman chris gent , finally won the fight in early 2000 in a deal that cost around 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 203 billion at today 's rate -rrb- .
but parts of the settlement unsettled german prosecutors in düsseldorf .
they questioned whether the severance packages that exceeded 100 million euros were legal .
and on monday , they ended a nearly two-year investigation by filing indictments against six people in a ground-breaking case that will explore the legal powers of company supervisory boards .
names of defendants withheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann prosecutors did not immediately release the names of the accused because the six had not received copies of the charges . but the case has the potential of becoming one of germany 's biggest business crime cases because some leading members of germany 's business and union communities are among those who have been under investigation .
the group includes : josef ackermann , the chairman of germany 's biggest bank , the deutsche bank .
klaus zwickel , the head of germany 's powerful union ig metall .
and klaus esser , the head of mannesmann at the time of the takeover .
at issue is the severance and retirement package that mannesmann executives received .
esser himself received a golden parachute of around 60 million marks -lrb- 31 million euros -rrb- .
prosecutors have said they think that there was no legal basis for the payments and that they caused severe financial damage to mannesmann .
as a result of these suspicions , they were considering whether to file charges of breach of trust and conspiracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel ackermann and zwickel have been under investigation because they served as members of the mannesmann board that approved the payments .
after learning earlier this month that an indictment was likely , ackermann defended the payments and said he would not resign if charges were filed .
esser maintains innocence esser reacted angrily to the indicment .
" there is not one shred of evidence showing i committed a crime , " he said .
he also is seeking damages in a lawsuit against the prosecutor 's office because he argues that prosecutors had no legitimate reason for opening their investigation .
the deutsche bank had no comment on the case on monday , and the ig metall said it expected that zwickel would be quickly exonerated . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dark days for german banks with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks .

but the city 's headteachers have said they will oppose the plans .
the city council has earmarked £ 113m for education in the coming year .
that means plymouth schools will face shortfalls of between £ 30,000 to £ 180,000 . "
children only get one chance " dr sean sweeney headteachers say the only way to balance the books is to make staff redundant .
at best , that will mean larger class sizes - at worst , schools will be forced to send children home .
headteachers are asking the city council to impose an 18 % rise in council tax , to save teachers ' jobs .
dr sean sweeney , chair of the plymouth association of head teachers and principals , said : " we are in a desperate position .
" we face having to lose good staff from schools at a time when recruiting staff to schools is enormously difficult . "
spending rules many teachers are calling for cash to be switched from projects such as revamping the tinside pool on plymouth 's waterfront .
the art deco pool will cost plymouth council tax payers £ 250,000 a year in subsidies , according to council figures .
dr sweeney said : " children only get one chance .
" they are our responsibility and if there is any loss of funding , that has a significant impact on them .
tax decision " headteachers will not stand by and watch that happen . "
a council spokesman said it was spending according to government spending rules .
devon county council is meeting on tuesday to ratify its decision to increase council tax by 18 % .
plymouth city council will confirm its budget next week .

the government 's reform of licensing laws introduces new regulations which some believe will drive them out of business .
north devon licensees meet their mp nick harvey at the old court house inn in chulmleigh on tuesday to discuss fighting the proposals .
landlords say the licensing bill will mean sizeable increases in the cost of running a pub .
they will be required to draw up detailed operating plans , with procedures for crowd control and evacuation of premises , more health and safety measures and extra staff .
musicians ' protest sam moyes , of the old court house inn , said : " the cost of implementing these changes will be an added burden .
" it will force some smaller pubs to close . "
the licensing bill has already come under fire from musicians .
pubs in england and wales will have to obtain licences from their local council for any form of entertainment , with a maximum punishment for performing without permission of £ 20,000 or six months in jail .
a government spokeswoman said the reforms would reduce bureaucracy for landlords , and increase safety for the public .

the social occasion was thought to be the first time all five members of the girl group had been together since geri halliwell left in 1998 .
halliwell , melanie brown , melanie chisholm , emma bunton and victoria beckham dominated british pop music in the late 1990s , becoming the uk 's most successful all-female group .
but halliwell left at the peak of their success , and the remaining four have not recorded together since 2000 .
it was confirmed the five met at the " beckingham palace " home of victoria and david beckham in sawbridgeworth , hertfordshire , on monday night .
' nonsense ' " they did meet but it was a social occasion , not about getting back together , " a spokeswoman for beckham said .
she added it was " nonsense " to think they were going to get back together as they were all working on solo projects .
" victoria has signed a new deal , emma has apparently signed a new deal .
geri is working on other things and it is just madness to say that they are getting back together , " added the spokeswoman .
geri halliwell became a unicef ambassador the spice girls ' success was , at the time , unprecedented in british pop music .
debut hit wannabe reached number one in july 1996 , as did their following five singles .
their nicknames - ginger , scary , sporty , baby and posh - helped them become household names , and they adopted the term " girl power " .
although the remaining four members never formally split up , reports of bad feeling between them have been widespread .
life after spice the first to leave , geri halliwell , has had the most success as a solo artist , with hits including 1999 's look at me and 2000 's bag it up .
a turbulent personal life has also kept her in the spotlight - including a brief , highly-publicised fling with tv presenter chris evans .
melanie chisholm played the v99 music festival as she attempted to branch out into a rockier sound , and enjoyed success with her album northern star .
its follow-up , reason , is due for release on 10 march .
but the other three spice girls have enjoyed only limited success in their solo careers .
tears on stage at the 2000 brits melanie brown released her solo debut album hot in summer 2002 to a muted reception , and is now appearing in bbc three drama burn it .
emma bunton scored a hit singing on tin tin out 's cover version of edie brickell 's what i am in 1999 , but her album a girl like me sold poorly and she lost a contract with virgin records .
ironically , she is now being managed by 19 management , the firm set up by simon fuller , who put the group together , only to find himself sacked as manager in 1997 .
victoria beckham is now better known as the wife of england footballer david than for her solo career .
she parted company with virgin records after her eponymous debut album sold poorly but has signed a new deal with another label .

recommendations tell customers central heating appliances need annual servicing identify causes for the number of billing complaints direct debit customers should get at least two bills a year higher technical standards & customer service skills should be included in training tenants should get ' who to contact ' advice for gas problems " with northern ireland 's traditionally high energy costs , it is reassuring that almost 80 % of consumers surveyed found their gas costs to be as expected or lower than expected , " he said .
" however , there is more work to be done . "
he said that one in five consumers were unhappy with the process of getting gas into their homes , and called for installers to improve their workmanship , especially when installing central heating systems .
he also called for phoenix to ensure that its complaints procedure " does not add to customers ' frustration " .
" with more than four in 10 customers dissatisfied with the way their complaint was handled , we are pleased that phoenix has agreed to work with the general consumer council to improve their systems , " he said .
mr costello acknowledged the " achievements of the gas industry in rolling out natural gas to 50,000 customers " .
the general consumer council represents gas customers and will assume responsibility for electricity customers from 1 april 2003 .

officials said that the monarch 's recovery from the operation one month ago had been better than expected and he was released early from hospital 10 days ago .
doctors treating the 69-year-old emperor have said they are confident he will make a full recovery .
tests following the surgery showed the cancer had not spread .
emperor akihito 's return to his official role was approved on tuesday by a cabinet vote .
one of the emperor 's first engagements will be to meet the president of afghanistan , hamid karzai , at the imperial palace on friday .
during his spell in hospital , emperor akihito 's constitutional duties were assumed by his son , crown prince naruhito .
break with tradition the news that the emperor was suffering from prostate cancer was given at the end of last year .
the announcement marked a break with tradition for the highly secretive imperial household .
the previous emperor died in 1989 before it was revealed that he too had been suffering from cancer .
emperor akihito was treated in a public hospital - the first time a japanese emperor has undergone surgery outside the palace grounds .
these initiatives are being seen as part of a modest drive to modernise the world 's longest reigning monarchy .
now 15 years into his reign , emperor akihito is considered to have more liberal and forward-thinking views than his father , the wartime emperor hirohito .

" if your quality of life and personal security have improved , go ahead and do it : vote sharon , " says yoel marcus of the left-wing newspaper , ha 'aretz .
the economy is not always the number-one priority prof. avia spivak bank of israel " if you feel that after 700 israelis have died and 1,600 have been injured , your life has improved immeasurably - then sharon is your man . "
mr marcus ' diatribe touches upon all the issues that have laid siege to the israeli way of life : the palestinian conflict , poor security and a dismal economy .
in the last two years , renewed conflict with the palestinians has helped plunge the israeli economy into the worst recession for 50 years .
downward spiral the link between conflict and economic sloth has become increasingly evident as unemployment soars , incomes drop and poverty increases .
mr sharon 's budget precipitated the elections " it the deepest recession that we have ever experienced in this country , " uriel lynn , chairman of the israeli chamber of commerce , told bbc news online .
" we have lost about $ 2.5bn -lrb- £ 1.5bn ; 2.3bn euros -rrb- in terms of business product . "
in 2002 , economic growth contracted by 1 % , just two years after israel saw an expansion of more than 7 % .
even before the flare-up of the palestinian conflict , the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 hurt a country that had carved itself a niche in the global it sector .
the subsequent palestinian intifada - or uprising - in the same year has cost the country about 3 % of its gdp and distracted attention from economic reform .
" the economy is not always the number-one priority , " professor avia spivak , deputy governor of the bank of israel , told bbc news online .
" israel is fighting to have its borders defined ... in that context , economic reform comes second to political fundamentals . "
listen to prof spivak 's thoughts on how a short war in iraq could be beneficial war effort the country is now seeing precious funds drain away , as it funds an expensive military campaign .
as a proportion of the budget , military spending , though historically high in israel , had been declining over the last decade .
however , in the last year it spiked again , accounting for more than 10 % of government spending , compared with an average of 2-3 % in the uk and 5 % in the us .
the amelioration of conflict is a necessary condition , but i 'm not sure it is sufficient prof. avia spivak bank of israel during 2002 , the bank of israel was also forced to raise interest rates to control spiralling inflation and stem the decline of the shekel .
prime minister ariel sharon , meanwhile , has pushed through a budget designed to cut public spending and rein in a widening deficit , but paid a high price .
disputes within mr sharon 's coalition left him without a parliamentary majority and forced him to call the general election .
election run-up there is not much clear water between the economic policies of mr sharon 's likud party and its left-wing rival , labour .
sharon 's likud and labour have similar policies but whichever party wins the election will have its work cut out .
the bank of israel is crying out for reforms to the tax system and would like to see greater investment in infrastructure to stimulate the economy .
the business lobby wants to see less red tape , a reduction of taxes and more privatisation .
" there is need for a massive reform so that the business sector can continue to grow , " says the chamber of commerce 's mr lynn .
economists also estimate that the new government will also need to cut budgetary spending by between 5bn shekels and 15bn shekels .
however , the worry for israel is not the need for reform - that is only too patent - it is whether the winning coalition will be tough enough .
" the lack of a single party majority , along with orthodox parties demanding a big chunk of social spending , have made the situation very difficult , " says timothy ash , an economist at bear stearns .
looking for recovery without prudent management of the economy , israel risks the return of inflation problems , devaluation of its currency and flight of capital .
" there would be a feeling that things were out of control , " says avia spivak , who is also an economics professor at ben gurion university .
mr lynn , who is only " 50 % optimistic " that reform will happen , says that " if it is not forthcoming in 30-60 days , it will become a matter of emergency " .
but there is no easy solution .
" the amelioration of conflict is a necessary condition , but i 'm not sure it is sufficient , " adds professor spivak .
every day israelis are shutting their wallets , getting laid off and even going hungry .
any improvement in the israeli " quality of life " may be a long way off . watch / listen on this story avia spivak , bank of israel " we know there is more demand for food where food is allocated to very poor people , so yes the israelis suffer " key stories coalition options pictures : sharon 's win israeli arabs ' struggle background q & a : israeli elections coalition poker game end of labour ?
