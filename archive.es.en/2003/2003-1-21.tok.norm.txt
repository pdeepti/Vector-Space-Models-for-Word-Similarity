a day earlier , delegates had angrily debated a joint german-french proposal for the future political framework of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer comments made by numerous participants in the convention on monday suggested the proposal would be met with fierce resistance .
the nuts and bolts the proposal , first put on the table by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac earlier this month , calls for expanded powers for the heads of both the european commission and the european council .
the franco-german proposal would in effect create a dual executive , with a commission president elected by the european parliament and a council president elected for a set term by the leaders of the member states .
it also refers to the appointment of a european foreign minister - a job currently split between javier solana and chris patten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and foreign minister dominique de villepin speaking before delegates gathered in brussels on tuesday , fischer and his french counterpart , dominique de villepin -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , sought to build support for the plan .
the most important element , fischer said , " is the election of the commission president . "
he argued that giving the parliament the power to elect the commission president would give the body teeth .
-lrb- currently , the parliament has no binding legal powers . -rrb-
" important compromises " while acknowledging the tough battle ahead , fischer also defended the proposal against critics , saying it already represented important compromises between germany and france .
indeed , germany had initially hoped to infuse the commission with more power , but eventually agreed to include the desires of the french , british and spanish that final say on any key decision remain with the national governments .
delegates from smaller european countries warned against eliminating the current rotating presidency , fearing that too much power would then be concentrated amongst the eu 's largest members , like germany , france and england .
unlike the current presidency , which rotates every six months , the new president would be elected for a term of up to five years .
the greatest resistance came from the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg , who issued a joint declaration stating they would refuse to support the creation of a full-time european council president .
critics say plan would weaken commission delegates also criticized the proposal because it would provide both the eu president and eu commission president with similar political power that could lead to rivalry and policy bottlenecks . others painted a gloomier picture .
elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the opposition christian democratic union , told the news agency agence france presse the proposal would push the commission into a position below that of the european council .
in that scenario , the important policy decisions of the day would be carried out by the council , which gives greater clout to larger member countries .
he warned of policy being determined bilaterally between countries like germany and france rather than as a collective european community .
however , fischer said fears of rivalry between the institutions could be allayed by clear rules defining the responsibilities of each eu body .
meanwhile , eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino cautioned that two competing executive bodies " would not lead to greater efficiency and transparency " in the european union .
the path to a dynamic eu ?
despite small differences of opinion , the proposal did receive support from the british .
peter hain , a welsh delegate at the convention , said he welcomed the proposal , which lays out the path for a " dynamic " eu .
other members of the convent have been critical of the timing of the franco-german proposal .
describing the maneuvers made by germany and france as " a big mistake , " german convention representative peter altmaier said there is " tremendous distrust " for germany and france at the convention . altmaier said germany and france should have sought to reconcile their own goals with those of the convention before submitting the paper .
more than 105 representatives of the european commission and member states , as well as members of the european parliament , are participating in the convent , whose goal it is to produce a draft of an eu constitution by summer .
european heads of government then plan to convene a summit during the second half of 2003 to consider the proposal .

without stronger cooperation between germany and france , the authors warned , the eu would become a watered-down body after it expands from 15 to 25 members in 2004 .
under the proposal , cabinet-level officials from france and germany would meet on a weekly basis .
the move , if adopted by the countries , would be the greatest diplomatic gesture between the two countries since germany and france - enemies for hundreds of years - reconciled with the signing of the elysee treaty in 1962 .

a day earlier , delegates had angrily debated a joint german-french proposal for the future political framework of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer comments made by numerous participants in the convention on monday suggested the proposal would be met with fierce resistance .
the nuts and bolts the proposal , first put on the table by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac earlier this month , calls for expanded powers for the heads of both the european commission and the european council .
the franco-german proposal would in effect create a dual executive , with a commission president elected by the european parliament and a council president elected for a set term by the leaders of the member states .
it also refers to the appointment of a european foreign minister - a job currently split between javier solana and chris patten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and foreign minister dominique de villepin speaking before delegates gathered in brussels on tuesday , fischer and his french counterpart , dominique de villepin -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , sought to build support for the plan .
the most important element , fischer said , " is the election of the commission president . "
he argued that giving the parliament the power to elect the commission president would give the body teeth .
-lrb- currently , the parliament has no binding legal powers . -rrb-
" important compromises " while acknowledging the tough battle ahead , fischer also defended the proposal against critics , saying it already represented important compromises between germany and france .
indeed , germany had initially hoped to infuse the commission with more power , but eventually agreed to include the desires of the french , british and spanish that final say on any key decision remain with the national governments .
delegates from smaller european countries warned against eliminating the current rotating presidency , fearing that too much power would then be concentrated amongst the eu 's largest members , like germany , france and england .
unlike the current presidency , which rotates every six months , the new president would be elected for a term of up to five years .
the greatest resistance came from the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg , who issued a joint declaration stating they would refuse to support the creation of a full-time european council president .
critics say plan would weaken commission delegates also criticized the proposal because it would provide both the eu president and eu commission president with similar political power that could lead to rivalry and policy bottlenecks . others painted a gloomier picture .
elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the opposition christian democratic union , told the news agency agence france presse the proposal would push the commission into a position below that of the european council .
in that scenario , the important policy decisions of the day would be carried out by the council , which gives greater clout to larger member countries .
he warned of policy being determined bilaterally between countries like germany and france rather than as a collective european community .
however , fischer said fears of rivalry between the institutions could be allayed by clear rules defining the responsibilities of each eu body .
meanwhile , eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino cautioned that two competing executive bodies " would not lead to greater efficiency and transparency " in the european union .
the path to a dynamic eu ?
despite small differences of opinion , the proposal did receive support from the british .
peter hain , a welsh delegate at the convention , said he welcomed the proposal , which lays out the path for a " dynamic " eu .
other members of the convent have been critical of the timing of the franco-german proposal .

describing the maneuvers made by germany and france as " a big mistake , " german convention representative peter altmaier said there is " tremendous distrust " for germany and france at the convention . altmaier said germany and france should have sought to reconcile their own goals with those of the convention before submitting the paper .
more than 105 representatives of the european commission and member states , as well as members of the european parliament , are participating in the convent , whose goal it is to produce a draft of an eu constitution by summer .
european heads of government then plan to convene a summit during the second half of 2003 to consider the proposal .
commissioners call for french , german eu engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen in a separate development tuesday , two french and german commissioners at the european union in brussels - enlargement commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- and trade minister pascal lamy - on tuesday called for the quasi-merger of the french and german governments in crucial policy areas . in an essay published jointly by the berliner zeitung newspaper and liberation , verheugen and lamy called for the establishment of joint ministries and joint sessions of each country 's parliament that would determine policy for both germany and france in the areas of foreign policy , defense and taxation and budget policy .
without stronger cooperation between germany and france , the authors warned , the eu would become a watered-down body after it expands from 15 to 25 members in 2004 .
under the proposal , cabinet-level officials from france and germany would meet on a weekly basis .
the move , if adopted by the countries , would be the greatest diplomatic gesture between the two countries since germany and france - enemies for hundreds of years - reconciled with the signing of the elysee treaty in 1962 .
the officials also invited other like-minded european countries to participate in the power-sharing agreement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu motor into overdrive : france and germany get ever cosier the berlin-paris axis gets stronger with plans for a historic joint parliamentary session and talk of listening in on each other 's cabinet meetings .

germany and france specifically are likely to pay a heavy price . the european union is set to punish germany for exceeding the three percent gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- budget deficit limit , the cornerstone of the eu 's stability and growth pact .
france is also due to get a warning letter at the ecofin meeting of european finance ministers in brussels on tuesday .
ministers have approved without discussion the measures in which they hope to bring germany back into line after months of promises from berlin .
the ecofin decision will lead to an expected formal recommendation that will demand a reduction in germany 's budget deficit over four years .
despite numerous warnings and brushes with eu enforced action , berlin admitted last week that its budget deficit hit 3.7 percent in 2002 .
accepting the decision without question , the german finance ministry pledged to reduce the debt in line with eu demands .
one eu diplomat told the financial times : " i ca n't see any controversial discussion " of the german case .
strict enforcement of demands the demands on germany are nothing new , but the force of the eu 's action is a definite hardening of its stance towards berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at risk : the stability of the euro .
germany was a strict advocate of the stability and growth pact , the rules that underpin the single currency .
despite insisting on its stringent controls , germany has been one of the main offenders in exceeding the gdp budget deficit limit .
under the pact , countries signed up for the single currency must keep below the three percent limit or risk destabilizing the euro .
under the rules , any member of the eurozone faces a discipline procedure if its budget deficit breaches the three percent limit of gdp , leading ultimately to heavy fines if corrective action is not taken .
the eu has fought hard to keep the original rules in place despite calls from certain member states to relax the budget control limit .

the eu has been aware of the risk that france 's deficit is in danger of breaching the three percent gdp limit and is now ready to formally deliver an official letter of warning to paris officials .

the finance ministers from the 12 eurozone countries are likely to take a tough line with paris and demand that france reduces its deficit by 0.5 percentage points per year , hoping to bring its finances close to balance by 2006 .
france is expected to vote against the eu action or abstain .
action should be linked to global economy , says paris the french , notorious for their refusal to accept specific deficit reduction targets , believe that any pledges to reduce the deficit would be hostage to the slowdown currently gripping the world economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond mutually beneficial eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda savoir vivre on wheels germany , france to forge tighter ties current affairs -pipe- 21.01.2003 from arch foes to friendly neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hallowed ground - the elysée palace in paris where the franco-german friendship treaty was signed forty years after the elysée treaty was signed , france and germany are gearing up to mark the occasion with glittering celebrations .
the seminal accord laid the foundation for close franco-german military cooperation . one might not exactly describe ties between germany and france today as " cozy , " but compare that to the atmosphere of deeply entrenched enmity preceding the end of world war ii and suddenly neighborly relations never seem to have looked better .
indeed relations between the two european powers plummeted after every bloody military encounter they had .
following the 1870/71 franco-german war , world war i and the treaty of versailles and the occupation of france during world war ii , the two nations broke off all diplomatic relations and remained arch foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle but just two decades after the end of world war ii , the far-sighted heads of state of the time , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer , came up with the franco-german friendship pact , also known as the elysée treaty , to kick-start the process of reconciliation .
increased military cooperation the main aim of the treaty , which was signed on january 22 , 1963 , was to harmonize franco-german security and defense concepts .
de gaulle and adenauer planned to intensify mutual cooperation as a way of coming to terms with the past and moving on towards the future .
the plan was not simply to crown the bilateral cooperation that had been working well since the 1950s , but rather to be able to influence and control the future european policies of the respective partner .
fears that germany might try to go its own way in its policy towards communist eastern europe played a big role .
the governments of both nations put special emphasis on the exchange of military personnel and strengthening mutual cooperation when it came to armaments .
one of the most significant examples of the cooperation was the " alpha-jet , " the first jet aircraft to be completed in germany after the end of the war , the work of german chancellor helmut schmidt and french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the franco-german pact was also responsible for creation of the transport aircraft " transall c160 " and the anti-aircraft system " roland . "
ever since the elysée treaty was signed , the germans and french have not just been meeting regularly at the highest political level but also encouraging a robust exchange of soldiers and generals .
in this way , soldiers have the opportunity to learn about the training and workings of their partner army .
for germany , france and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- is greated by french president francois mitterand during the german-french summit in karlsruhe in 1988 , german chancellor helmut kohl and french president françois mitterand reached an agreement on a mutual large-scale military unit with a rotating commando , called the franco-german brigade .
the two statesmen even went one step further and formed a franco-german defense and security council , laying the foundation for a european pillar in the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
the end of the cold war and communism saw the creation of a mutual european military unit , the eurocorps .

indeed relations between the two european powers plummeted after every bloody military encounter they had .
following the 1870/71 franco-german war , world war i and the treaty of versailles and the occupation of france during world war ii , the two nations broke off all diplomatic relations and remained arch foes .

increased military cooperation the main aim of the treaty , which was signed on january 22 , 1963 , was to harmonize franco-german security and defense concepts .
de gaulle and adenauer planned to intensify mutual cooperation as a way of coming to terms with the past and moving on towards the future .
the plan was not simply to crown the bilateral cooperation that had been working well since the 1950s , but rather to be able to influence and control the future european policies of the respective partner .
fears that germany might try to go its own way in its policy towards communist eastern europe played a big role .
the governments of both nations put special emphasis on the exchange of military personnel and strengthening mutual cooperation when it came to armaments .
one of the most significant examples of the cooperation was the " alpha-jet , " the first jet aircraft to be completed in germany after the end of the war , the work of german chancellor helmut schmidt and french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the franco-german pact was also responsible for creation of the transport aircraft " transall c160 " and the anti-aircraft system " roland . "
ever since the elysée treaty was signed , the germans and french have not just been meeting regularly at the highest political level but also encouraging a robust exchange of soldiers and generals .

in its latest triumph , the city is to acquire the seminal collection of its prominent son , photographer helmut newton . it was something helmut newton said he ’ d always do - donate his entire photographic archive , many of nude women , to his home town , berlin .
after much media speculation and rumors in art circles , the world-renowed photographer seems to be holding true to his word . the 82-year-old german-born , jewish star photographer , who is best known for his sensational nudes , has decided to hand over his life 's work to the german capital .
and although the contracts have yet to be signed , michael donermeyer , spokesperson for the berlin city government told dw-world it was now “ highly likely ” that the collection would come to berlin . “ i fell in love with that building ” newton admitted that it was berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit who finally convinced him to give his collection to the city , during “ a rather charming reception ” at berlin ’ s city hall -lrb- known as the roten rathaus -rrb- last summer . if all goes to plan , the extensive set of photographs will eventually be housed in the former art library in the western charlottenburg district of the city according to newton ’ s wishes . “ i fell in love with that building , ” newton told berlin broadsheet , berliner morgenpost , explaining that it had been the last building he 'd seen when he left berlin in 1938 to escape the nazis . from germany to down under helmut newton is regarded as one of the most important fashion and portrait photographers of the 20th century .

newton has frequently stirred up controversy with his images of naked amazon-like beauties , often photographed gleaming with oil and engaging in banal activities . but newton insists that he shows women as strong personalities , not as victims .

the seminal accord laid the foundation for close franco-german military cooperation . one might not exactly describe ties between germany and france today as " cozy , " but compare that to the atmosphere of deeply entrenched enmity preceding the end of world war ii and suddenly neighborly relations never seem to have looked better .
indeed relations between the two european powers plummeted after every bloody military encounter they had .
following the 1870/71 franco-german war , world war i and the treaty of versailles and the occupation of france during world war ii , the two nations broke off all diplomatic relations and remained arch foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle but just two decades after the end of world war ii , the far-sighted heads of state of the time , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer , came up with the franco-german friendship pact , also known as the elysée treaty , to kick-start the process of reconciliation .
increased military cooperation the main aim of the treaty , which was signed on january 22 , 1963 , was to harmonize franco-german security and defense concepts .
de gaulle and adenauer planned to intensify mutual cooperation as a way of coming to terms with the past and moving on towards the future .
the plan was not simply to crown the bilateral cooperation that had been working well since the 1950s , but rather to be able to influence and control the future european policies of the respective partner .
fears that germany might try to go its own way in its policy towards communist eastern europe played a big role .
the governments of both nations put special emphasis on the exchange of military personnel and strengthening mutual cooperation when it came to armaments .
one of the most significant examples of the cooperation was the " alpha-jet , " the first jet aircraft to be completed in germany after the end of the war , the work of german chancellor helmut schmidt and french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the franco-german pact was also responsible for creation of the transport aircraft " transall c160 " and the anti-aircraft system " roland . "
ever since the elysée treaty was signed , the germans and french have not just been meeting regularly at the highest political level but also encouraging a robust exchange of soldiers and generals .
in this way , soldiers have the opportunity to learn about the training and workings of their partner army .
for germany , france and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- is greated by french president francois mitterand during the german-french summit in karlsruhe in 1988 , german chancellor helmut kohl and french president françois mitterand reached an agreement on a mutual large-scale military unit with a rotating commando , called the franco-german brigade .
the two statesmen even went one step further and formed a franco-german defense and security council , laying the foundation for a european pillar in the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
the end of the cold war and communism saw the creation of a mutual european military unit , the eurocorps .
besides germany and france , belgium , luxembourg and spain also signed up as contributors .
the high level of trust that increased franco-german military cooperation also brought about the unthinkable : german troops participated in the french national day parade in paris on july 14 , 1994 as part of the eurocorps mandate .
it was widely hailed as a highlight of franco-german military cooperation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germany and france specifically are likely to pay a heavy price . the european union is set to punish germany for exceeding the three percent gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- budget deficit limit , the cornerstone of the eu 's stability and growth pact .
france is also due to get a warning letter at the ecofin meeting of european finance ministers in brussels on tuesday .
ministers have approved without discussion the measures in which they hope to bring germany back into line after months of promises from berlin .
the ecofin decision will lead to an expected formal recommendation that will demand a reduction in germany 's budget deficit over four years .
despite numerous warnings and brushes with eu enforced action , berlin admitted last week that its budget deficit hit 3.7 percent in 2002 .
accepting the decision without question , the german finance ministry pledged to reduce the debt in line with eu demands .
one eu diplomat told the financial times : " i ca n't see any controversial discussion " of the german case .
strict enforcement of demands the demands on germany are nothing new , but the force of the eu 's action is a definite hardening of its stance towards berlin .
however , the eu is unlikely to push the germans for more cuts than those they are already struggling with , given that the tough measures imposed on germany so far have helped drive it close to recession - threatening the entire continent 's economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at risk : the stability of the euro .
germany was a strict advocate of the stability and growth pact , the rules that underpin the single currency .
despite insisting on its stringent controls , germany has been one of the main offenders in exceeding the gdp budget deficit limit .
under the pact , countries signed up for the single currency must keep below the three percent limit or risk destabilizing the euro .
under the rules , any member of the eurozone faces a discipline procedure if its budget deficit breaches the three percent limit of gdp , leading ultimately to heavy fines if corrective action is not taken .
the eu has fought hard to keep the original rules in place despite calls from certain member states to relax the budget control limit .
unsurprisingly , it has mostly been countries in danger of breaking the pact that have called for more leniency .
france to reach the limit in 2003 another country feeling the pressure from brussels on tuesday will be france , one of the supporters of more relaxed limits .
france looks set to receive a stinging rebuke for failing to keep its finances in check .
the eu has been aware of the risk that france 's deficit is in danger of breaching the three percent gdp limit and is now ready to formally deliver an official letter of warning to paris officials .
the french government has forecast a 2.6 percent deficit for this year with financial experts expecting it to be closer to 2.9 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12 eurozone finance ministers .
the finance ministers from the 12 eurozone countries are likely to take a tough line with paris and demand that france reduces its deficit by 0.5 percentage points per year , hoping to bring its finances close to balance by 2006 .
france is expected to vote against the eu action or abstain .
action should be linked to global economy , says paris the french , notorious for their refusal to accept specific deficit reduction targets , believe that any pledges to reduce the deficit would be hostage to the slowdown currently gripping the world economy .
in their view the pact should be interpreted flexibly , taking into account global conditions .
francis mer , the french finance minister , is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to water down the wording of the warning at tuesday 's meeting .
both germany and france , the eurozone 's two biggest economies , are suffering from sluggish economies that are making it harder for them to meet budget pledges .
some eu ministers want strong words to be backed up with strong action to send a clear signal to germany and france that they remain committed to the budget rules they accepted when they signed up to the stability and growth pact .
elsewhere on the ecofin agenda , ministers will review the european commission 's recent assessment of italian , greek , austrian , and swedish medium-term budget plans .

the seminal accord laid the foundation for close franco-german military cooperation . one might not exactly describe ties between germany and france today as " cozy , " but compare that to the atmosphere of deeply entrenched enmity preceding the end of world war ii and suddenly neighborly relations never seem to have looked better .
indeed relations between the two european powers plummeted after every bloody military encounter they had .
following the 1870/71 franco-german war , world war i and the treaty of versailles and the occupation of france during world war ii , the two nations broke off all diplomatic relations and remained arch foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle but just two decades after the end of world war ii , the far-sighted heads of state of the time , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer , came up with the franco-german friendship pact , also known as the elysée treaty , to kick-start the process of reconciliation .
increased military cooperation the main aim of the treaty , which was signed on january 22 , 1963 , was to harmonize franco-german security and defense concepts .
de gaulle and adenauer planned to intensify mutual cooperation as a way of coming to terms with the past and moving on towards the future .
the plan was not simply to crown the bilateral cooperation that had been working well since the 1950s , but rather to be able to influence and control the future european policies of the respective partner .
fears that germany might try to go its own way in its policy towards communist eastern europe played a big role .
the governments of both nations put special emphasis on the exchange of military personnel and strengthening mutual cooperation when it came to armaments .
one of the most significant examples of the cooperation was the " alpha-jet , " the first jet aircraft to be completed in germany after the end of the war , the work of german chancellor helmut schmidt and french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the franco-german pact was also responsible for creation of the transport aircraft " transall c160 " and the anti-aircraft system " roland . "
ever since the elysée treaty was signed , the germans and french have not just been meeting regularly at the highest political level but also encouraging a robust exchange of soldiers and generals .
in this way , soldiers have the opportunity to learn about the training and workings of their partner army .

a day earlier , delegates had angrily debated a joint german-french proposal for the future political framework of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer comments made by numerous participants in the convention on monday suggested the proposal would be met with fierce resistance .
the nuts and bolts the proposal , first put on the table by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac earlier this month , calls for expanded powers for the heads of both the european commission and the european council .
the franco-german proposal would in effect create a dual executive , with a commission president elected by the european parliament and a council president elected for a set term by the leaders of the member states .
it also refers to the appointment of a european foreign minister - a job currently split between javier solana and chris patten .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and foreign minister dominique de villepin speaking before delegates gathered in brussels on tuesday , fischer and his french counterpart , dominique de villepin -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , sought to build support for the plan .
the most important element , fischer said , " is the election of the commission president . "
he argued that giving the parliament the power to elect the commission president would give the body teeth .
-lrb- currently , the parliament has no binding legal powers . -rrb-
" important compromises " while acknowledging the tough battle ahead , fischer also defended the proposal against critics , saying it already represented important compromises between germany and france .
indeed , germany had initially hoped to infuse the commission with more power , but eventually agreed to include the desires of the french , british and spanish that final say on any key decision remain with the national governments .
delegates from smaller european countries warned against eliminating the current rotating presidency , fearing that too much power would then be concentrated amongst the eu 's largest members , like germany , france and england .
unlike the current presidency , which rotates every six months , the new president would be elected for a term of up to five years .
the greatest resistance came from the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg , who issued a joint declaration stating they would refuse to support the creation of a full-time european council president .
critics say plan would weaken commission delegates also criticized the proposal because it would provide both the eu president and eu commission president with similar political power that could lead to rivalry and policy bottlenecks . others painted a gloomier picture .
elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the opposition christian democratic union , told the news agency agence france presse the proposal would push the commission into a position below that of the european council .
in that scenario , the important policy decisions of the day would be carried out by the council , which gives greater clout to larger member countries .
he warned of policy being determined bilaterally between countries like germany and france rather than as a collective european community .
however , fischer said fears of rivalry between the institutions could be allayed by clear rules defining the responsibilities of each eu body .
meanwhile , eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino cautioned that two competing executive bodies " would not lead to greater efficiency and transparency " in the european union .
the path to a dynamic eu ?
despite small differences of opinion , the proposal did receive support from the british .
peter hain , a welsh delegate at the convention , said he welcomed the proposal , which lays out the path for a " dynamic " eu .
other members of the convent have been critical of the timing of the franco-german proposal .
describing the maneuvers made by germany and france as " a big mistake , " german convention representative peter altmaier said there is " tremendous distrust " for germany and france at the convention . altmaier said germany and france should have sought to reconcile their own goals with those of the convention before submitting the paper .
more than 105 representatives of the european commission and member states , as well as members of the european parliament , are participating in the convent , whose goal it is to produce a draft of an eu constitution by summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2003 berlin pulls off arts coup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm a feminist " - helmut newton with one of his controversial nudes the german capital may be bankrupt , but its arts scene can still pack a punch .
in its latest triumph , the city is to acquire the seminal collection of its prominent son , photographer helmut newton . it was something helmut newton said he ’ d always do - donate his entire photographic archive , many of nude women , to his home town , berlin .
after much media speculation and rumors in art circles , the world-renowed photographer seems to be holding true to his word . the 82-year-old german-born , jewish star photographer , who is best known for his sensational nudes , has decided to hand over his life 's work to the german capital .
and although the contracts have yet to be signed , michael donermeyer , spokesperson for the berlin city government told dw-world it was now “ highly likely ” that the collection would come to berlin . “ i fell in love with that building ” newton admitted that it was berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit who finally convinced him to give his collection to the city , during “ a rather charming reception ” at berlin ’ s city hall -lrb- known as the roten rathaus -rrb- last summer . if all goes to plan , the extensive set of photographs will eventually be housed in the former art library in the western charlottenburg district of the city according to newton ’ s wishes . “ i fell in love with that building , ” newton told berlin broadsheet , berliner morgenpost , explaining that it had been the last building he 'd seen when he left berlin in 1938 to escape the nazis . from germany to down under helmut newton is regarded as one of the most important fashion and portrait photographers of the 20th century .
born to a jewish-german button magnate and an american in berlin in 1920 , he began learning his trade from the renowned fashion photographer yva in 1936 .
two years later newton and his family fled nazi germany .
the 18-year old made his way alone to australia via singapore and participated in world war ii as a soldier on the side of his newly-adopted country . after the war newton set up a studio in melbourne and first has his photos published in australian vogue in 1952 .
by 1961 he was spending most of his time shooting fashion in paris , but by 1981 , newton had “ retired ” to monaco to devote himself to portrait and commercial photography . controversial amazons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut newton newton turned to photographing nudes in the 1980s and these pictures are famous for what is regarded as blatantly cold eroticism , a mixture of eroticism and decadence .
newton has frequently stirred up controversy with his images of naked amazon-like beauties , often photographed gleaming with oil and engaging in banal activities . but newton insists that he shows women as strong personalities , not as victims .
" i am a feminist , " newton recently told the german magazine stern . and the photographer also claims his images don ’ t hide any messages .
“ you can drill as long as you want , but you won ’ t find anything on the inside , ” he has maintained on many occasions . another coup gaining the helmut newton collection is the latest arts coup for the city , which recently convinced art collector , friederich-christian flick to house his collection there from 2004 . flick ’ s 2,000-work collection is one of the largest holdings of contemporary art in the world and includes works by bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , signmar polke , richard serra , on kawara and nam june paik . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " like a farmer and his potatoes " in the exhibition “ sex and landscapes ” , world acclaimed german-born photographer helmut newton shows both his monumental images of naked women and a collection of relatively unknown still lives and landscapes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.01.2003 eu heavyweights under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability of the euro could be under threat european union finance ministers meet in brussels on tuesday to discuss , among other things , serious breaches of the stability and growth pact .
germany and france specifically are likely to pay a heavy price . the european union is set to punish germany for exceeding the three percent gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- budget deficit limit , the cornerstone of the eu 's stability and growth pact .
france is also due to get a warning letter at the ecofin meeting of european finance ministers in brussels on tuesday .
ministers have approved without discussion the measures in which they hope to bring germany back into line after months of promises from berlin .
the ecofin decision will lead to an expected formal recommendation that will demand a reduction in germany 's budget deficit over four years .
despite numerous warnings and brushes with eu enforced action , berlin admitted last week that its budget deficit hit 3.7 percent in 2002 .
accepting the decision without question , the german finance ministry pledged to reduce the debt in line with eu demands .
one eu diplomat told the financial times : " i ca n't see any controversial discussion " of the german case .
strict enforcement of demands the demands on germany are nothing new , but the force of the eu 's action is a definite hardening of its stance towards berlin .
however , the eu is unlikely to push the germans for more cuts than those they are already struggling with , given that the tough measures imposed on germany so far have helped drive it close to recession - threatening the entire continent 's economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at risk : the stability of the euro .
germany was a strict advocate of the stability and growth pact , the rules that underpin the single currency .
despite insisting on its stringent controls , germany has been one of the main offenders in exceeding the gdp budget deficit limit .
under the pact , countries signed up for the single currency must keep below the three percent limit or risk destabilizing the euro .
under the rules , any member of the eurozone faces a discipline procedure if its budget deficit breaches the three percent limit of gdp , leading ultimately to heavy fines if corrective action is not taken .
the eu has fought hard to keep the original rules in place despite calls from certain member states to relax the budget control limit .
unsurprisingly , it has mostly been countries in danger of breaking the pact that have called for more leniency .
france to reach the limit in 2003 another country feeling the pressure from brussels on tuesday will be france , one of the supporters of more relaxed limits .
france looks set to receive a stinging rebuke for failing to keep its finances in check .
the eu has been aware of the risk that france 's deficit is in danger of breaching the three percent gdp limit and is now ready to formally deliver an official letter of warning to paris officials .
the french government has forecast a 2.6 percent deficit for this year with financial experts expecting it to be closer to 2.9 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12 eurozone finance ministers .
the finance ministers from the 12 eurozone countries are likely to take a tough line with paris and demand that france reduces its deficit by 0.5 percentage points per year , hoping to bring its finances close to balance by 2006 .
france is expected to vote against the eu action or abstain .
action should be linked to global economy , says paris the french , notorious for their refusal to accept specific deficit reduction targets , believe that any pledges to reduce the deficit would be hostage to the slowdown currently gripping the world economy .
in their view the pact should be interpreted flexibly , taking into account global conditions .
francis mer , the french finance minister , is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to water down the wording of the warning at tuesday 's meeting .
both germany and france , the eurozone 's two biggest economies , are suffering from sluggish economies that are making it harder for them to meet budget pledges .
some eu ministers want strong words to be backed up with strong action to send a clear signal to germany and france that they remain committed to the budget rules they accepted when they signed up to the stability and growth pact .
elsewhere on the ecofin agenda , ministers will review the european commission 's recent assessment of italian , greek , austrian , and swedish medium-term budget plans .
these need confirmation and backing from the eu finance ministers before they can be implemented in the countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

germany and france specifically are likely to pay a heavy price . the european union is set to punish germany for exceeding the three percent gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- budget deficit limit , the cornerstone of the eu 's stability and growth pact .
france is also due to get a warning letter at the ecofin meeting of european finance ministers in brussels on tuesday .
ministers have approved without discussion the measures in which they hope to bring germany back into line after months of promises from berlin .
the ecofin decision will lead to an expected formal recommendation that will demand a reduction in germany 's budget deficit over four years .
despite numerous warnings and brushes with eu enforced action , berlin admitted last week that its budget deficit hit 3.7 percent in 2002 .
accepting the decision without question , the german finance ministry pledged to reduce the debt in line with eu demands .
one eu diplomat told the financial times : " i ca n't see any controversial discussion " of the german case .
strict enforcement of demands the demands on germany are nothing new , but the force of the eu 's action is a definite hardening of its stance towards berlin .
however , the eu is unlikely to push the germans for more cuts than those they are already struggling with , given that the tough measures imposed on germany so far have helped drive it close to recession - threatening the entire continent 's economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at risk : the stability of the euro .
germany was a strict advocate of the stability and growth pact , the rules that underpin the single currency .
despite insisting on its stringent controls , germany has been one of the main offenders in exceeding the gdp budget deficit limit .
under the pact , countries signed up for the single currency must keep below the three percent limit or risk destabilizing the euro .
under the rules , any member of the eurozone faces a discipline procedure if its budget deficit breaches the three percent limit of gdp , leading ultimately to heavy fines if corrective action is not taken .
the eu has fought hard to keep the original rules in place despite calls from certain member states to relax the budget control limit .
unsurprisingly , it has mostly been countries in danger of breaking the pact that have called for more leniency .
france to reach the limit in 2003 another country feeling the pressure from brussels on tuesday will be france , one of the supporters of more relaxed limits .
france looks set to receive a stinging rebuke for failing to keep its finances in check .
the eu has been aware of the risk that france 's deficit is in danger of breaching the three percent gdp limit and is now ready to formally deliver an official letter of warning to paris officials .
the french government has forecast a 2.6 percent deficit for this year with financial experts expecting it to be closer to 2.9 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12 eurozone finance ministers .
the finance ministers from the 12 eurozone countries are likely to take a tough line with paris and demand that france reduces its deficit by 0.5 percentage points per year , hoping to bring its finances close to balance by 2006 .
france is expected to vote against the eu action or abstain .
action should be linked to global economy , says paris the french , notorious for their refusal to accept specific deficit reduction targets , believe that any pledges to reduce the deficit would be hostage to the slowdown currently gripping the world economy .
in their view the pact should be interpreted flexibly , taking into account global conditions .
francis mer , the french finance minister , is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to water down the wording of the warning at tuesday 's meeting .
both germany and france , the eurozone 's two biggest economies , are suffering from sluggish economies that are making it harder for them to meet budget pledges .
some eu ministers want strong words to be backed up with strong action to send a clear signal to germany and france that they remain committed to the budget rules they accepted when they signed up to the stability and growth pact .
elsewhere on the ecofin agenda , ministers will review the european commission 's recent assessment of italian , greek , austrian , and swedish medium-term budget plans .
these need confirmation and backing from the eu finance ministers before they can be implemented in the countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the seminal accord laid the foundation for close franco-german military cooperation . one might not exactly describe ties between germany and france today as " cozy , " but compare that to the atmosphere of deeply entrenched enmity preceding the end of world war ii and suddenly neighborly relations never seem to have looked better .
indeed relations between the two european powers plummeted after every bloody military encounter they had .
following the 1870/71 franco-german war , world war i and the treaty of versailles and the occupation of france during world war ii , the two nations broke off all diplomatic relations and remained arch foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle but just two decades after the end of world war ii , the far-sighted heads of state of the time , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer , came up with the franco-german friendship pact , also known as the elysée treaty , to kick-start the process of reconciliation .
increased military cooperation the main aim of the treaty , which was signed on january 22 , 1963 , was to harmonize franco-german security and defense concepts .
de gaulle and adenauer planned to intensify mutual cooperation as a way of coming to terms with the past and moving on towards the future .
the plan was not simply to crown the bilateral cooperation that had been working well since the 1950s , but rather to be able to influence and control the future european policies of the respective partner .
fears that germany might try to go its own way in its policy towards communist eastern europe played a big role .
the governments of both nations put special emphasis on the exchange of military personnel and strengthening mutual cooperation when it came to armaments .
one of the most significant examples of the cooperation was the " alpha-jet , " the first jet aircraft to be completed in germany after the end of the war , the work of german chancellor helmut schmidt and french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the franco-german pact was also responsible for creation of the transport aircraft " transall c160 " and the anti-aircraft system " roland . "
ever since the elysée treaty was signed , the germans and french have not just been meeting regularly at the highest political level but also encouraging a robust exchange of soldiers and generals .
in this way , soldiers have the opportunity to learn about the training and workings of their partner army .
for germany , france and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- is greated by french president francois mitterand during the german-french summit in karlsruhe in 1988 , german chancellor helmut kohl and french president françois mitterand reached an agreement on a mutual large-scale military unit with a rotating commando , called the franco-german brigade .
the two statesmen even went one step further and formed a franco-german defense and security council , laying the foundation for a european pillar in the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
the end of the cold war and communism saw the creation of a mutual european military unit , the eurocorps .
besides germany and france , belgium , luxembourg and spain also signed up as contributors .
the high level of trust that increased franco-german military cooperation also brought about the unthinkable : german troops participated in the french national day parade in paris on july 14 , 1994 as part of the eurocorps mandate .
it was widely hailed as a highlight of franco-german military cooperation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

there were shots from all over - everything was in confusion raul gonzales , chavez supporter talks to resolve the crisis resumed on monday , despite president chavez 's threat at the weekend to walk out of the negotiations .
the bbc 's adam easton , in caracas , says violence is a constant threat in venezuela , as the oil-rich country becomes increasingly polarised by a strike which is causing severe fuel shortages .
opposition leaders called the work stoppage to force president chavez to call early elections , accusing him of concentrating power and plunging the country into recession .
mr chavez says the strike is a thinly-veiled attempt to overthrow him .
confused there are conflicting reports as to who opened fire on the crowd in charavalle .
troops seized control of two bottling plants last week miranda state governor enrique mendoza said supporters of the president attacked an opposition march in the area .
but raul gonzalez , who was shot in the leg , said he and other chavez supporters were blocking a road as opposition marchers approached and that both sides began hurling stones and bottles .

" i have always hoped for a resolution , and i hope there will be one , " said mr carter after meeting president chavez .
he described those talks as " positive " , afp news agency reported .
the stoppage has crippled oil production in the country - which before the strike was the world 's fifth largest oil exporter - and led to chronic shortages in food and fuel .
mr chavez has said he would not be forced into negotiating with the opposition strikers .
accusing private television stations of supporting the strikers , his government started legal procedures against two of the country 's main broadcasters on monday .
