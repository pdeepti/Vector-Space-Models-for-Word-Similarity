greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.07.2003 trading organs for money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is calling for tighter controls of organ donations in an effort to stop their illegal trade .
the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .

there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .

mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .

many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .
many are blaming ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters – one of the strike ’ s main backers – for the debacle and are questioning whether he should now head the union this autumn . “ if i were in his situation , i would seriously consider making personal consequences , ” klaus mehrens , head of ig metall ’ s frankfurt branch , told the rheinpfalz newspaper on tuesday . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from ig metall chairman klaus zwickel , who is retiring in october . a " disastrous defeat " hasso düvel , ig metall head for berlin and brandenburg and the union ’ s prime negotiator during the strike , has also come under fire .
on tuesday he indicated he might step down , saying the incident was a " disastrous defeat " for ig metall . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with business , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east is as high as 18 percent .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides tarnishing the union ’ s image with the public , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly dented the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . " this defeat will weaken the unions for many years to come .
it will lead to a clear isolation of the east , " rené vits , works council chairman of the dresden-based automobile part supplier federal mogul , told the berliner zeitung on monday .
" what should the smaller , weaker unions do , when even the ig metall can ’ t push through anything ? " in an effort to salvage some of its goal , ig metall is now focusing on negotiating reduced working time with companies on a plant-specific basis .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .

mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.07.2003 trading organs for money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is calling for tighter controls of organ donations in an effort to stop their illegal trade .
the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "

the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .

on tuesday he indicated he might step down , saying the incident was a " disastrous defeat " for ig metall . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with business , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .
many are blaming ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters – one of the strike ’ s main backers – for the debacle and are questioning whether he should now head the union this autumn . “ if i were in his situation , i would seriously consider making personal consequences , ” klaus mehrens , head of ig metall ’ s frankfurt branch , told the rheinpfalz newspaper on tuesday . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from ig metall chairman klaus zwickel , who is retiring in october . a " disastrous defeat " hasso düvel , ig metall head for berlin and brandenburg and the union ’ s prime negotiator during the strike , has also come under fire .
on tuesday he indicated he might step down , saying the incident was a " disastrous defeat " for ig metall . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with business , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east is as high as 18 percent .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .
many are blaming ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters – one of the strike ’ s main backers – for the debacle and are questioning whether he should now head the union this autumn . “ if i were in his situation , i would seriously consider making personal consequences , ” klaus mehrens , head of ig metall ’ s frankfurt branch , told the rheinpfalz newspaper on tuesday . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from ig metall chairman klaus zwickel , who is retiring in october . a " disastrous defeat " hasso düvel , ig metall head for berlin and brandenburg and the union ’ s prime negotiator during the strike , has also come under fire .
on tuesday he indicated he might step down , saying the incident was a " disastrous defeat " for ig metall . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with business , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east is as high as 18 percent .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides tarnishing the union ’ s image with the public , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly dented the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . " this defeat will weaken the unions for many years to come .
it will lead to a clear isolation of the east , " rené vits , works council chairman of the dresden-based automobile part supplier federal mogul , told the berliner zeitung on monday .
" what should the smaller , weaker unions do , when even the ig metall can ’ t push through anything ? " in an effort to salvage some of its goal , ig metall is now focusing on negotiating reduced working time with companies on a plant-specific basis .
it has already hammered out deals with a handful of firms in saxony , which foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry strikes to end trade union leaders and employers failed to resolve the battle over the 35-hour working week in the eastern german auto industry .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .

when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .
scientists hope that cross-species transplants between humans and pigs will help alleviate part of the shortage .
but many questions remain -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .
many are blaming ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters – one of the strike ’ s main backers – for the debacle and are questioning whether he should now head the union this autumn . “ if i were in his situation , i would seriously consider making personal consequences , ” klaus mehrens , head of ig metall ’ s frankfurt branch , told the rheinpfalz newspaper on tuesday . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from ig metall chairman klaus zwickel , who is retiring in october . a " disastrous defeat " hasso düvel , ig metall head for berlin and brandenburg and the union ’ s prime negotiator during the strike , has also come under fire .
on tuesday he indicated he might step down , saying the incident was a " disastrous defeat " for ig metall . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with business , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east is as high as 18 percent .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides tarnishing the union ’ s image with the public , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly dented the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . " this defeat will weaken the unions for many years to come .
it will lead to a clear isolation of the east , " rené vits , works council chairman of the dresden-based automobile part supplier federal mogul , told the berliner zeitung on monday .
" what should the smaller , weaker unions do , when even the ig metall can ’ t push through anything ? " in an effort to salvage some of its goal , ig metall is now focusing on negotiating reduced working time with companies on a plant-specific basis .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .

the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .

" the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .

the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .

germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours , in an effort to bring practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on saturday after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down comes as a massive blow . " there ’ s no doubt that the ig metall miscalculated – we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich told german television . after publicly admitting ig metall completely bungled the labor dispute , some members have started calling for heads to roll .
many are blaming ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters – one of the strike ’ s main backers – for the debacle and are questioning whether he should now head the union this autumn . “ if i were in his situation , i would seriously consider making personal consequences , ” klaus mehrens , head of ig metall ’ s frankfurt branch , told the rheinpfalz newspaper on tuesday . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from ig metall chairman klaus zwickel , who is retiring in october . a " disastrous defeat " hasso düvel , ig metall head for berlin and brandenburg and the union ’ s prime negotiator during the strike , has also come under fire .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .

mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .

greece completed its six-month term as president of the european union on june 30 .
the period will likely go down as one of the most turbulent in the organization 's history . coming at a time of when " project europe " seemed to be on track , the last thing the greek presidency of the european union expected was the chaos , bitterness and infighting the iraq war caused within the eu . a little more than a month before the first u.s. rockets fell on baghdad in march , eight european countries signed a letter supporting america 's imminent military invasion of iraq .
the letter , published in the wall street journal europe , opened wide the fissure that had begun to crack relations between pro and anti-war camps . greek prime minister costa simitis , whose country had assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on january 1 following a historic summit that paved the way to expand the eu by 10 countries , quickly called a meeting . the emergency summit in athens in february brought pro-war countries like spain and great britain into a compromise with leading war opponents germany and france . the accomplishment was the first of many for the greek government , which officially ends when italy takes over as eu president on july 1 , for the next six months . in a half year as turbulent as any in the history of the eu , greece presided over the iraq crisis , the drafting of the eu 's first-ever constitution and the official welcome for the union 's ten new members . pulling great britain back into the fold following the easing of tensions over iraq , the eu smoothed ruffled feathers within its ranks by agreeing on supporting a central role for the united nations in the war-torn country .
even great britain , america 's greatest ally , was pulled back into the fold , helping to draft the statement along with spain , germany and france . " the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country , " read the final draft , reflecting none of the division of the previous months . at the same summit in april , the ten new member nations of the european union , from eastern europe and the mediterranean , officially signed the treaty of accession in an historic ceremony in athens .
they will join the eu in 2004 , marking the biggest expansion yet in the history of the postwar institution . the first draft of the document that will chart the course of the expanded union made its debut last month at a conference in porto carras .
the european constitution aims to streamline decision-making and make the eu more visible abroad by establishing a president and foreign minister post .
european leaders gave their approval to the first draft , saying it was a good blueprint to work from . success balanced out by failures approval has also greeted simitis ' -lrb- photo -rrb- work of the past few months .
his diplomatic successes have bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister constantine simitis him rumored to succeed european union commission president roman prodi in a few years .
the greek foreign minister has also been tipped to assume the newly-created foreign minister post , one that german foreign minister joschka fischer is reportedly also up for . the greek successes have been balanced out by some failure .
despite efforts by the u.n. and a visit by simitis , greece and turkey were unable to find a way to reunify the divided island of cyprus .
the southern , greek two-thirds of the island is scheduled to enter the eu along with the nine other candidates in 2004 setting the stage for more tension between old rivals greece and turkey . simitis ' other two stated goals when greece took over the presidency in december - fashioning a common security policy and fighting illegal immigration - never made the progress the greek leader expected .
the idea of a common security policy suffered a setback after germany , france , luxembourg and belgium met separately to draft a european defense initiative at the end of april . greece also failed to shepherd through a comprehensive common eu policy on asylum and immigration .
though eu countries pledged to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting europe 's expanded borders , many observers said the deal fell short of what a country like greece - which receives many of the immigrants from the middle east and africa - needs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution dominates debate at summit a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .

the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .
when his friends first brought up the idea four years ago , he was hesitant , but as he realized that the situation in moldova was not about to improve , he opted to go ahead .
once the process was set in motion , there was no looking back .
and before mihail knew it , he had received identification papers from a contact he didn ’ t know , and was making the first big journey of his life .
" a woman called nina took me to turkey , where i was housed in a hotel for two months .
then i was taken to the hospital for the operation , " mihail told deutsche welle radio .
mihail is one of countless eastern europeans who have ended up in turkey to sell one of their kidneys .
but at least in his case he knew what he was doing .
many other unemployed people from the poorest countries on the continent are lured to turkey on the promise of finding work , but end up instead on the operating table .
a high price for a small fee mihail received $ 3,000 for his kidney , which amounts to ten times more than his average annual income , but it is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands that patients pay to keep themselves alive .
mihail ’ s money came in good use for his family , but he has paid with his health , and he can no longer do the heavy physical work the farm requires without feeling pain .
four years after his operation , mihail has set out on his second journey abroad .
this time he is going to the council of europe in strasbourg in order to draw attention to the flourishing illegal organ trade industry .
he is accompanied by swiss parliamentarian ruth-gaby vermot-mangold .
a european concern vermot-mangold traveled to strasbourg to present a report on organ trafficking commissioned by the council of europe , which wants to see registers of donors introduced in all member states .
her research was based on time she spent in moldova , where she spoke to young people who gave up their kidneys for money .
in one case , she came across a young man who is now dependent on a dialysis machine because his remaining kidney was damaged during the illegal operation .
" it is a huge injustice that poor people in poor countries have to donate organs to rich people .
and the most disgusting thing about it all as far as i ’ m concerned , is that it is used to make money . "
dealing with the problem many of those who travel to turkey for a new organ are israeli dialysis patients whose health insurance companies pay for the transport costs without asking any uncomfortable questions .
but vermot-mangold says there is evidence that other european countries , including germany are involved in the illegal trade .
" we have evidence that illegal transplants are also carried out in germany .
i think the german police which deals with organized crime , should take a long , hard look " , vermot-mangold told deutsche welle .
germany is not the only country which will have to keep its eyes open , as the report has triggered the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to call on european governments to establish a cross-border strategy against illegal organ trade and to offer financial back-up for the international police authorities , interpol and europol . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplanting everything but the oink every year thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant .

it 's a place our families like to be , " said gen. wald .
tens of thousands of u.s. soldiers could be shifted outside of western europe , as the military considers shrinking its presence in countries like germany and moving them east to countries that supported the iraq war . the presence of american soldiers in southern germany has been as integral a part of germany 's postwar history as the deutsche mark or helmut kohl .
of the 106,000 active armed forces ' personnel in the united states european command , 70,000 soldiers -lrb- and 90,000 family members -rrb- are stationed in germany .
for decades , cities like heidelberg in baden württemberg , wiesbaden in hesse or grafenwöhr in bavaria have closely identified with the american soldiers patrolling nearby bases .
gi 's in return have pumped tens of millions of dollars into their local economies and employed thousands of civilians .
with threats to the united states shifting from the former soviet union to the middle east , central asia and northern africa , military planners have begun making plans to reduce the size of u.s. bases in germany .
european countries with a lower cost of living and doing business - like poland and hungary , where the u.s. trained kurdish iraqi opposition fighters before the gulf war - have been mentioned as possible new locations for bases and the economic windfalls they bring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles wald headshot , as joint chiefs of staff vice director for strategic plans and policy , photo dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .
there has been a lot of speculation in the european media about bases opening here and closing there .
what sort of movement is going to take place and why is the discussion taking place now ?
around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore .
the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south .
the turbulence to the middle east culminating now in operation iraqi freedom , the caspian sea , are becoming more strategically important from a standpoint of terrorism and the same thing applies to countries in the horn of africa as well as sub-saharan africa .
we start looking around and think what are the united states ' geopolitical interests , where are they , what are the strategic interests ?
are we in the right places , do we have too many people stationed overseas , is there a different way to have a presence in europe ?
what you 'll see in the next six months or so will be a decision for some of those forces to be shifted , some within the european command and maybe some to go back home and it could be a fairly large number .
there are n't any specific numbers because final review has n't been completed , but the numbers that have been discussed have been fairly large , 30 to 40 percent , that could be changed , shifted or sent back home .
u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld has had this plan in mind since assuming his post in 2000 .
why is the discussion taking place now , at a time when u.s. and german relations are n't exactly good ?
the underlying question a lot of people have is : is this being done because of the perceived public political rift between the united states and germany ... -lrb- there has been -rrb- much to do about that in the news , is this being precipitated as part of a rift between the united states and germany or other nato countries ?
and the answer is : no , it 's not .
this would need to be done regardless of any of those political decisions .
one of the areas that is critical to the united states military is training .
when you 're looking at germany , particularly , one of their fortes as a country is the attention they pay to their environment .
the u.s. army trains at grafenwöhr -lrb- in bavaria -rrb- and over the years because of the attention the u.s. army has paid to making sure they 're good stewards of the environment , the environmental status of grafenwöhr has now changed to that point that it 's a protected area .
it 's one of those ironic catch 22s .
as a result of the good stewardship of the u.s. military we 've done such a good job of protecting the environment that you ca n't train there .
there seems to be a little more latitude in the eastern european countries that are emerging now to allow better training opportunities - so that 's definitely a part of this , there 's no doubt about it .
looking at it from a strategic standpoint , what are the disadvantages of basing the military in germany ?
the biggest disadvantage is probably that our training is limited .
there are many things that speak for germany : one -lrb- is -rrb- it 's a secure environment , two it 's a place our families like to be .
it 's an ocean closer to the threat . our presence here in germany allows us probably up to two weeks faster deployment of forces towards the middle east . on the other hand , we do want to have our forces close to various types of transportation , whether it be sea or air types of transportation .
so wherever we are , we 'll need to have that .
the response from the emerging nato countries is very positive , as you can imagine .
they 're interested in the united states being in their countries . ...
and there 's something to be said about that as well .
it is nice to be wanted .
the towns surrounding u.s. bases in germany that have benefited economically from u.s. armed forces ' presence for more than 50 years want you as well .
what have you done to allay their concerns ?
i think there will be some towns in germany that will have less forces , where those are i ca n't tell you right now .
it 's good to see the german population , the mayors and others , interested now in the fact that things could change .
the united states ' presence in some of those areas brings in a significant income , there 's no doubt about it .
so as we go down this road i think it is good that people who would prefer that we stay voice that opinion .
that might make some difference and it is important that we 're in places that are accommodating enough that we can do our job .
you talk about a shift in basing strategy away from the ' mini-americas ' where service personnel and their families can buy everything from blue jeans to aunt jemima 's syrup with u.s. dollars .
what are the bases of the future likely to look like ?
they will be basic bases with fuel , water maybe some ramp space or some training areas that would -lrb- be -rrb- periodically used - either for crisis or training or could be used as a temporary duty operation where we could train with local populations .
or they could be bases that can provide a stepping stone approach because of the great distances where we could land , rest , refuel aircraft en route .
there is hesitancy among the population of countries like the czech republic , where the president recently said czechs would be uncomfortable with foreign troops after decades of soviet occupation - are you worried the welcome mat wo n't be rolled out ?
we have n't seen any of that .
the one good thing about the united states is that we 've never occupied territory .
wherever we 've been we 've improved things either economically or even environmentally .
when our welcome is up we will generally leave in good spirits .
the beauty of this thing we 're in now is there will be a discussion with all the players and then we 're going to have to negotiate with the countries where potentially we desire to go to .
is all this expected to take place soon ?
i think there 's a desire to do this fairly quickly .
within the next year from now , you 'll see decisions made or some movement made already .
by this fall , it will become pretty clear .
there 's a fiscal reality and a physical reality but i think the intention for it is to happen pretty quick .

the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down . mihail is from the south-east european republic of moldova , where both unemployment and poverty are rife .
the 28-year-old father and farmer with the worn , brown face who could pass for almost 50 , talks reluctantly about his experience of donating a kidney .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2003 german tax cuts unsettle brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi issued strong warnings for germany 's economy .
the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s announcement on sunday that his cabinet had approved income tax cuts to kickstart europe ’ s largest economy would normally be received with a mild sense of relief in brussels – anything to pull the german economy out of the doldrums .
but the european commission responded instead with words of caution , saying tax cuts could not be financed through more state debt .
the tax reform put forth by the german government calls for bringing forward to 2004 a cut in income taxes originally scheduled for 2005 .
the move is expected to result in 10 percent less income tax per person and is believed to save small and medium-sized companies billions of euros .
" ten percent less tax means 10 percent more consumption , " schröder told reporters on sunday in a simplified explanation of how the tax cut would spur economic growth .
finance ministry experts claim the package is worth 1.0 percent in terms of annual growth , a significant amount considering the german economy is currently hovering around the zero percent zone .
but the tax cut is also slated to cost the government between 16 and 18 billion euros -lrb- 17.5 to 20.5 billion dollars -rrb- .
that ’ s money the government doesn ’ t have right off the bat .
and that ’ s what worries eu officials in brussels .
proper financing although chancellor schröder has stressed that the tax cuts would be financed within the budget – he has called for reductions in state subsidies and benefits - experts are not too sure this is entirely feasible .
they worry that germany would have to resort to borrowing to counter the loss in revenue from the cut in income taxes .
the european commission for economic and monetary affairs warned germany of the " risks " involved in financing the multi-billion-euro tax cut .
commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said germany had to be careful not to incur additional debt through the tax reform .
" every tax cut has to be properly financed , " he said on monday .
last week , economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said that germany could not count on eu support for its stimulus plan if it fails to bring its deficit under the three percent ceiling established by the stability and growth pact .
germany ’ s finance minister , hans eichel , insisted sunday that next year ’ s deficit would be just under the eu limit , but most analysts are less optimistic .
jochen dieckmann , regional finance minister in germany ’ s biggest state north-rhine westphalia , and a member of schröder ’ s social democrats , told reporters on monday that meeting the eu deficit limit for 2004 is now " simply impossible . "
if that is the case , it will be the third year in a row that germany fails to bring its budget within the eu fiscal framework .
berlin is already facing eu disciplinary measures for surpassing the three percent ceiling .
another missed target could mean a credibility blow to the euro zone pact .
an eu fetish or a valuable tool ?
eu commission president romano prodi warned germany against taking any steps that could cause the euro zone stability pact to come unraveled .
the pact , which was originally designed to prevent eu countries which adopted the euro from burdening the single currency with hefty budget deficits , has come into question as some of the euro zone ’ s biggest economies - germany , france and italy - struggle with economic downturns and risk running foul of the deficit rules .
germany ’ s failure to remain within the pact ’ s budgetary guidelines is seen by many as an indication that the agreement needs to be reformed .
just ahead of taking over the eu ’ s rotating presidency on july 1 , italy ’ s minister for european affairs rocco buttiglione called for a reconsideration of the stability pact .
" many of the things that appeared set in stone at one time are no longer so , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on saturday .
the italian minister criticized the pact as " hypocritical " and proposed " a reasonable and transparent reform " which both " reinforces it and makes it more flexible . "
luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was the only foreign official attending the german government ’ s weekend retreat to discuss tax reforms , said the stability pact needed to be reformed .
" it simply can ’ t be that the pact is held onto like a fetish , " he was quoted as saying in the berliner zeitung .
but prodi for his part called on the euro zone members to adhere to the budget guidelines , which " have helped the eu to resist inflation and keep interest rates low . "
he told the german bild am sontag that the pact " is and remains an extremely valuable tool which we should use with intelligence . "
although several countries are having difficulty keeping their budget deficit under three percent of gdp , prodi said in the sunday paper that he disagreed with those who argued that " governments should move away from a healthy base that supports the euro .

the work and pensions select committee said that parents in poor families will not be able to move from welfare to work unless they are given more help with childcare .
the national average cost of childcare for a nursery place for one child is £ 128 per week , or £ 7,000 a year .
the government has targeted extra cash for special children 's centres in the 20 % of most deprived local authority wards .
investing in childcare is an investment in all our futures stephen burke daycare trust but , publishing a report on tuesday , the mps said it is " extremely concerned " that there are , " significant gaps " in poor areas outside the 20 % worst off .
in childcare for working parents , mps were critical of childcare tax credits which are designed to help parents on low incomes pay for childcare .
just 178,000 people are claiming the benefit and the report says too few people are eligible .
cathy ashton , the minister responsible for childcare , accepted that more had to be done to help parents .
" we now offer free early education to all four-year-olds , and all three-year-olds will have the same entitlement by april 2004 .
" we also provide substantial financial help towards the costs of childcare through tax credits paid direct to parents , amounting to at least £ 1m per day .
" we will consider the report carefully to see what we can learn from it . "
' ambitious drive ' stephen burke , director of childcare charity the daycare trust , welcomed the mps ' report .
he said : " universal children 's centres are key to the government delivering on its ambitious drive to end child poverty and create a better , fairer britain .
" childcare benefits everyone .
investing in childcare is an investment in all our futures . "

flights to oslo , geneva , zurich and milan are expected to start in october , all operated by airline duo .
it has been able to establish the new routes after receiving money from the scottish executive 's development fund , set up to increase the number of direct flights from scotland .
until now duo has only operated flights for ba out of birmingham airport , but it said it will use its own name and livery when flying from edinburgh .
duo managers have described the firm as " not a typical budget airline " and said flights will be priced between low-cost and premium rates . "
we believe we have found the recipe for success by offering passengers the best of both worlds - quality service and affordable fares " peter spencer duo peter spencer , chief executive of duo , said he wants to bridge the gap between the no-frills carriers and the scheduled operators .
" we believe we have found the recipe for success by offering passengers the best of both worlds - quality service and affordable fares , " he said .
" there have been great changes in public perception of , and expectations from , the airline industry .
" but passengers have limited choice and we believe there is a gap in the market that we will fill . "
' stronger market ' earlier this year , the executive set up a £ 6.5m development fund to encourage more airlines to fly to and from scotland .
duo will be the fourth airline to benefit from executive cash .
bmi and german wings both announced new routes from edinburgh earlier this year and ryanair has added another two destinations from prestwick airport .
so far glasgow has been unable to use the fund to attract new routes .
it is understood that duo 's decision to fly the routes from edinburgh was based on the expectation that the capital has a stronger business market than its west coast rival .

until now duo has only operated flights for ba out of birmingham airport , but it said it will use its own name and livery when flying from edinburgh .
duo managers have described the firm as " not a typical budget airline " and said flights will be priced between low-cost and premium rates .
we believe we have found the recipe for success by offering passengers the best of both worlds - quality service and affordable fares peter spencer duo peter spencer , chief executive of duo , said he wants to bridge the gap between the no-frills carriers and the scheduled operators .
" we believe we have found the recipe for success by offering passengers the best of both worlds - quality service and affordable fares , " he said .
" there have been great changes in public perception of , and expectations from , the airline industry .
" but passengers have limited choice and we believe there is a gap in the market that we will fill . "
' stronger market ' earlier this year , the executive set up a £ 6.5m development fund to encourage more airlines to fly to and from scotland .
duo will be the fourth airline to benefit from executive cash .
bmi and german wings both announced new routes from edinburgh earlier this year and ryanair has added another two destinations from prestwick airport .
so far glasgow has been unable to use the fund to attract new routes .
it is understood that duo 's decision to fly the routes from edinburgh was based on the expectation that the capital has a stronger business market than its west coast rival .

the eu wanted a tight visa regime to protect its new eastern border .
the move will have a major impact on the lives of at least a million people in the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad , trapped between lithuania and poland .
residents here can only travel to and from russia proper with permission from vilnius .
' model of co-operation ' until now travelling between moscow and kaliningrad could n't have been easier .
russian citizens presented a simple transit paper at the lithuanian border .
those days have now gone for good and the issue of access to kaliningrad threatened to turn ugly .
russia 's relations with europe were at stake .
russia feared its enclave would be forced into isolation and moscow dug her heels in .
but after a passionate debate the two sides agreed on a compromise - a new travel document , that 's cheap and easy to obtain .
they now hail the agreement as a model of co-operation .
and for those who want to bypass the bureaucracy altogether , aeroflot has doubled its daily flights , ruling vilnius out of the equation entirely .
building on its unexpected success , moscow now wants to go further .
president vladimir putin is pushing for russians to be granted visa-free travel all over europe .
but until he can prove russia 's making substantial progress in tackling organised crime and migration , no-one in europe is taking him seriously .
