the news that three members of the tamil tigers had blown themselves up with their boat off sri lanka 's northern coast rather than surrender to the navy was a sobering reminder of how fragile a process this is . "
even though it was a tragic incident ... we have continued with the peace process " anton balasingham , tamil tiger negotiator the tamil tiger negotiators in berlin were furious and clearly felt let down by the international monitors who keep watch over the ceasefire between the rebels and government forces .
the monitors said the tigers had broken the ceasefire agreement by taking weapons into an area controlled by the other side .
the motive , they suggested , was the smuggling of arms .
the tigers hotly denied it , and said their boat had simply gone to help a trawler which had broken down .
the boat had only one gun on board , they said .
in short , it was a mess .
but after a brief delay the talks went on , under the careful mediation of the norwegian government .
the chief rebel negotiator anton balasingham said : " anyone with any intelligence or military knowledge can safely assume that this was not an act of smuggling .
" but the most important thing is that even though it was a tragic incident ... we have continued with the peace process . "
and in that spirit , the two sides moved forward .
agreements there were agreements on the rehabilitation of child soldiers and the rapid implementation of reconstruction projects to try to show ordinary people the practical benefits of peace .
an important decision was also made in relation to broader human rights issues .
the former head of amnesty international , ian martin , has been asked by the government and the tigers to produce a blueprint of human rights measures which might be included in a final settlement , such as formal training in humanitarian and human rights law .
in a country which has been scarred by the gross abuse of human rights for many years , that is quite a step forward but there is a nagging doubt .
how much of what is agreed around the negotiating table will actually be implemented on the ground ?
food for sceptics there are clearly people on both sides who would like this process to fail - hard-line rebels who do not want to give up the goal of a separate state and critics of the government who say it is naive in trusting the tamil tigers in the first place . "
this is a sequel to 20 years of a ferocious war and these problems are not going to be sorted out overnight " gl peiris , chief government negotiator the sceptics on both sides will try to use the naval clash as evidence to bolster their case .
it certainly did nothing to help re-establish trust .
more worrying for the peace camp , though , is the fear that international donors may be more reluctant to open their pockets if they believe the cease-fire is under threat .
so this is a time for optimists to stand their ground .
the government 's chief negotiator in berlin , gl peiris , admitted that it is an " extremely complex and painful situation " .
but he called on the donor community to have faith in the negotiations .
slow progress " this is a sequel to 20 years of a ferocious war and these problems are not going to be sorted out overnight , " professor peiris said .
" but i think the international community has shown a degree of maturity and perception in understanding the circumstances . "
in a matter of months , the peace talks have made real progress but a final political settlement is still some way off .
there will be plenty of difficult moments ahead - peace always comes at a price .
but the only alternative is a grim one : a return to a conflict which has bled sri lanka dry .

mr adams asked an audience of sinn fein activists in west belfast whether the climate was right for a significant move by the ira .
then , answering his own question , he said : " i hardly think so . "
could it be that republicans , having weighed up the costs and benefits of a spring deal , no longer think it is " game on " ?

but he came away , according to one senior us congressman who spoke to the bbc , doubting whether the key players had the will to reach an agreement .
' bases and installations ' another source spoke of mr haass 's frustration that republicans appeared to be more interested in " strategising " than making historic gestures .
it certainly looks as if tony blair and bertie ahern will have their work cut out when they arrive this week for another round of talks with the parties .
visiting south armagh over the last few days , it was possible to let the mind wonder about how different things might look if there is a deal .
since the good friday agreement , the security forces have demolished 37 bases and installations - three of them -lrb- two surveillance posts and a sangar -rrb- were in south armagh .
however , sinn fein still point to the remaining posts and bases in the area -lrb- anything between 13 and 18 depending on how you count them -rrb- as evidence that demilitarisation has n't gone far enough .
it 's safe to assume that if - with gerry adams ' latest comments notwithstanding - the ira does make a bold gesture , then tearing down most of the remaining watchtowers will form part of the payback .
' continuing threat ' irish justice minister michael mcdowell has clearly been thinking about what might happen next in those circumstances .
a bill he is about to push through the dail will allow for members of the garda siochana to go on temporary secondments north of the border .
it does n't stretch the imagination too far to think of the possibility of seconded gardai playing a role in community policing in a demilitarised crossmaglen .
unionists are understandably concerned that pulling down the border posts might compromise their safety , given the continuing threat from dissident republicans .
but the justice minister indicated to bbc radio ulster 's inside politics programme that he believes the risk is worth taking and that he will give the irish police all the backing it needs to take on any dissidents who try to bring down any future deal .
but will there be a deal ?
republicans and government officials are still wrangling over the details .
mr mcdowell is against the creation of new all-ireland policing and justice bodies - just one of the many items on sinn fein 's shopping list .
if republicans decide , as gerry adams indicates , that the time is not right to reach agreement , they will risk alienating london , dublin and washington in the uncertain hope of a achieving a better deal in the autumn , by which time it 's likely that the face of unionism could look rather different .

according to the observer newspaper , bae systems - britain 's biggest defence firm by far - is set to announce that delays and overspending in two key contracts have cost it £ 800m .
the firm is in talks with the ministry of defence over changes to contracts to build the nimrod surveillance planes and the astute class submarines , in the hope of limiting any potential losses .
the report is the latest in a series of shocks to hit the firm , most notably being forced to share a plum £ 2.8bn contract to build new aircraft carriers for the british navy .
the sunday times newspaper reported that the stresses over the past few months were likely to force sweeping changes in the bae systems boardroom , including the possible ousting of chairman sir dick evans and chief executive mike turner .
knives out according to the sunday times , " turmoil " has broken out within the bae board .
major shareholders are reportedly calling for the chairman 's scalp , while pressure on mr turner is coming from non-executive directors .
the newspaper said it expected some sort of action by 20 february , when it presents its full-year 2002 results .
resolution of boardroom battles would also help in its ongoing talks with the government , its main client and until recently a reliable ally .
time for talks negotiations with the mod are reportedly proceeding well , but the eventual cost to bae is likely to be heavy .
the two problematic contracts , together worth £ 5bn , are not likely to be altered easily .

according to the observer newspaper , bae systems - britain 's biggest defence firm by far - is set to announce that delays and overspending in two key contracts have cost it £ 800m .
the firm is in talks with the ministry of defence over changes to contracts to build the nimrod surveillance planes and the astute class submarines , in the hope of limiting any potential losses .
the report is the latest in a series of shocks to hit the firm , most notably being forced to share a plum £ 2.8bn contract to build new aircraft carriers for the british navy .
the sunday times newspaper reported that the stresses over the past few months were likely to force sweeping changes in the bae systems boardroom , including the possible ousting of chairman sir dick evans and chief executive mike turner .
knives out according to the sunday times , " turmoil " has broken out within the bae board .
some are calling for mr turner 's head major shareholders are reportedly calling for the chairman 's scalp , while pressure on mr turner is coming from non-executive directors .
the newspaper said it expected some sort of action by 20 february , when it presents its full-year 2002 results .
resolution of boardroom battles would also help in its ongoing talks with the government , its main client and until recently a reliable ally .
time for talks negotiations with the mod are reportedly proceeding well , but the eventual cost to bae is likely to be heavy .
the two problematic contracts , together worth £ 5bn , are not likely to be altered easily .
the net result will be smaller mod orders , easier for bae systems to complete on time , but ultimately less lucrative .
analysts are also concerned that the company has lost its credibility with the ministry , which is increasingly willing to funnel large orders to non-british companies .

he is going to berlin and paris , which are among the most vocal opponents of the looming war - but they are all under heavy pressure from washington to give up their reservations .
much has been read into president putin 's statement last week when he said that russia may toughen its stance towards iraq if it does not comply with united nations demands .
some saw it as a sign of moscow easing up its opposition to the use of force against iraq .
others believed it was a message to iraq to get real and do something to help russia to defend it at the un security council .
russia has the right to veto an unacceptable decision but that would ruin the new-found strategic partnership between moscow and washington .
two other permanent members of the security council , france and china , which are also opposed to the use of force against iraq , do not seem eager to exercise their right of veto either and for the same reason .
united front on top of damaging relations with the world 's only superpower , russian politicians say , a veto may force washington to go it alone , making the un security council irrelevant , and effectively destroying the current world order built around the un . "
the wording of a second un resolution may well be on president putin 's agenda " that is why russia would like to keep the matter away from a damaging vote .
to succeed , russian diplomats say , moscow should keep up a united front with other prominent opponents of the war .
president putin 's state visits to germany and france , on the eve of the crucial meeting of the un security council on 14 february , are aimed at achieving just that .
to give diplomacy another chance , moscow is even prepared to give up its opposition to a new resolution on iraq provided , as russian foreign minister igor ivanov said , it strengthens the weapons inspectors ' mandate without opening the road to the use of force against iraq .
the wording of such a resolution may well be on the agenda of president putin 's european tour .

finlay macdonald , the moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland , said the prime minister should guard against forming a link between asylum and terrorism .
refugee groups and politicians criticised mr blair 's pledge , which he made during a bbc newsnight programme .
a home office spokesman has since said the prime minister intended the comment to be viewed as an objective rather than a target . "
in scotland and the uk as a whole , we have strong traditions of decency and hospitality " finlay macdonald moderator of the general assembly mr blair said he wanted asylum seeker numbers cut by 30 % or 40 % " in the next few months " .
he said he thought the numbers " should have " halved by september .
but dr macdonald said the prime minister 's comments were unhelpful .
speaking during a civic lunch in aberdeen , he expressed concern about the way things were developing " in relation to iraq " .
he said : " one of these is the subtle and not to subtle , linking asylum seekers with terrorism .
' desperate people ' " coming on top of his recent remarks about a possible derogation from the european convention on human rights , mr blair 's remarks can only serve to strengthen that link in people 's minds . "
dr macdonald conceded national security was " clearly important " , but added that the " vast majority " of asylum seekers were not terrorists .
rather , they werer " unfortunate and desperate people " fleeing persecution , he said .
" in scotland and the uk as a whole , we have strong traditions of decency and hospitality . "
he added : " we must take care lest , in a legitimate concern not to allow these to be exploited , we abandon them altogether . "
a home office spokeswoman said : " the prime minister was highlighting progress that we expect to make as a result of the measures in the nationality immigration and asylum act .
" we have said all along that once the act starts to kick-in then we would expect to see reductions and those would be measured and assessed .
" the prime minister said the halving of the applications was a longer term objective for years to come .
" it is an indicator of progress rather than a target as such . "
