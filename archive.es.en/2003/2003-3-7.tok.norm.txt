but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .
what the vote in the house of commons showed was that a substantial minority , but still a minority , of the members of the house of commons had doubts at that stage whether military action was then warranted .
the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .
britain is a state which only undertakes or supports military action if it is compatible with the rule of international law .
and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

on tuesday , two former members of the east german secret police went on trial for his death . the killing happened nearly 27 years ago , at a time when two germanys existed and their border was a death trap for those trying to flee from the communist east to the democratic west .
but the killing has still not been forgotten by the victim 's family or the german justice system .
and on tuesday , a berlin court began its latest effort to determine how and why michael gartenschläger was shot to death by east german border guards after he dismantled one of the communist country 's most secret border weapons - self-firing guns whose existence east german leaders had repeatedly denied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut meckel -lrb- left -rrb- and wolfgang singer helmut heckel and wolfgang singer -lrb- photo , left to right -rrb- , two former officers of the east german secret police , the stasi , are on trial .
they are facing manslaughter charges because prosecutors maintain they helped devise the plan that led to gartenschläger 's death in 1976 .
both men denied the charges on tuesday .
" the manslaughter charge is wrong , " heckel said , a 71-year-old former stasi colonel .
" i am not the spritual father of the plan , " said singer , a 60-year-old former stasi lieutenant colonel .
coming to terms with violent past the two men are being tried as the german justice system continues to wrestle with the bloody past of the inner german border .
in all , 916 people are thought to have been killed or died in their attempts to cross the border .
the victims included people trying to escape across the mine-covered frontier , people trying to get around the concrete wall in berlin and the 32-year-old gartenschläger , a west german resident who was out to smear east germany 's international image .
trials stemming from the deaths have led to the conviction of former east german leader egon krenz , among others .
but that has not been the case with gartenschläger 's death .
three former east german border guards were acquitted of murder charges in 2000 because of conflicting testimony about the course of the events that occurred early on may 1 , 1976 .
gartenschläger was no friend of east germany , the country that built the berlin wall , shut the then 17-year-old off from his favorite record shops in the west and eventually sentenced him to a life term in prison for being part of a " counterrevolutionary terror group " that wrote graffiti and burned down a barn .
after 10 years in prison , the west german government bought his freedom in 1971 as part of a program to help political prisoners in east germany .
organizing escapes from the east gartenschläger used his freedom to nettle the government that had robbed him of it in the first place .
his primary mission was to help other people escape , and he even provided people with passports with which they could escape through libya , according to the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
in 1975 , gartenschläger learned about the weapon that would eventually cost him his life - the sm 70 self-firing gun .
the former east german decided he would provide west german officials with one .
" if they need the thing and do n't have it , you 'll get the thing for them , " he was quoted as saying .
and that is what he did , handing it over to the german news magazine der spiegel .
he went back a short time later and dismantled another .
this caused the stasi to launch its own operation to stop him .
using its long reach deep into west germany , the stasi learned that gartenschläger planned a third visit to the border on the evening of april 30 , 1976 , and its officers decided to put an end to his activities .
armed with a pistol , gartenschläger headed to the border in search of his third sm 70 .
what happened after that is uncertain .
during the first trial , witnesses testified that gartenschläger fired first and the east germans fired back .
but no gunpowder was found on gartenschläger 's hand .
after hearing the testimony , the judge said that everything was possible but that " nothing can be proven . "
and he acquitted the three defendants . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de play sheds light on dark east german secret a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .

the victims included people trying to escape across the mine-covered frontier , people trying to get around the concrete wall in berlin and the 32-year-old gartenschläger , a west german resident who was out to smear east germany 's international image .
trials stemming from the deaths have led to the conviction of former east german leader egon krenz , among others .
but that has not been the case with gartenschläger 's death .
three former east german border guards were acquitted of murder charges in 2000 because of conflicting testimony about the course of the events that occurred early on may 1 , 1976 .
gartenschläger was no friend of east germany , the country that built the berlin wall , shut the then 17-year-old off from his favorite record shops in the west and eventually sentenced him to a life term in prison for being part of a " counterrevolutionary terror group " that wrote graffiti and burned down a barn .
after 10 years in prison , the west german government bought his freedom in 1971 as part of a program to help political prisoners in east germany .
organizing escapes from the east gartenschläger used his freedom to nettle the government that had robbed him of it in the first place .
his primary mission was to help other people escape , and he even provided people with passports with which they could escape through libya , according to the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
in 1975 , gartenschläger learned about the weapon that would eventually cost him his life - the sm 70 self-firing gun .
the former east german decided he would provide west german officials with one .
" if they need the thing and do n't have it , you 'll get the thing for them , " he was quoted as saying .
and that is what he did , handing it over to the german news magazine der spiegel .
he went back a short time later and dismantled another .
this caused the stasi to launch its own operation to stop him .
using its long reach deep into west germany , the stasi learned that gartenschläger planned a third visit to the border on the evening of april 30 , 1976 , and its officers decided to put an end to his activities .
armed with a pistol , gartenschläger headed to the border in search of his third sm 70 .
what happened after that is uncertain .
during the first trial , witnesses testified that gartenschläger fired first and the east germans fired back .
but no gunpowder was found on gartenschläger 's hand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut meckel -lrb- left -rrb- and wolfgang singer helmut heckel and wolfgang singer -lrb- photo , left to right -rrb- , two former officers of the east german secret police , the stasi , are on trial .
they are facing manslaughter charges because prosecutors maintain they helped devise the plan that led to gartenschläger 's death in 1976 .
both men denied the charges on tuesday .
" the manslaughter charge is wrong , " heckel said , a 71-year-old former stasi colonel .
" i am not the spritual father of the plan , " said singer , a 60-year-old former stasi lieutenant colonel .
coming to terms with violent past the two men are being tried as the german justice system continues to wrestle with the bloody past of the inner german border .
in all , 916 people are thought to have been killed or died in their attempts to cross the border .
the victims included people trying to escape across the mine-covered frontier , people trying to get around the concrete wall in berlin and the 32-year-old gartenschläger , a west german resident who was out to smear east germany 's international image .
trials stemming from the deaths have led to the conviction of former east german leader egon krenz , among others .
but that has not been the case with gartenschläger 's death .
three former east german border guards were acquitted of murder charges in 2000 because of conflicting testimony about the course of the events that occurred early on may 1 , 1976 .
gartenschläger was no friend of east germany , the country that built the berlin wall , shut the then 17-year-old off from his favorite record shops in the west and eventually sentenced him to a life term in prison for being part of a " counterrevolutionary terror group " that wrote graffiti and burned down a barn .
after 10 years in prison , the west german government bought his freedom in 1971 as part of a program to help political prisoners in east germany .
organizing escapes from the east gartenschläger used his freedom to nettle the government that had robbed him of it in the first place .
his primary mission was to help other people escape , and he even provided people with passports with which they could escape through libya , according to the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung .
in 1975 , gartenschläger learned about the weapon that would eventually cost him his life - the sm 70 self-firing gun .
the former east german decided he would provide west german officials with one .
" if they need the thing and do n't have it , you 'll get the thing for them , " he was quoted as saying .
and that is what he did , handing it over to the german news magazine der spiegel .
he went back a short time later and dismantled another .
this caused the stasi to launch its own operation to stop him .
using its long reach deep into west germany , the stasi learned that gartenschläger planned a third visit to the border on the evening of april 30 , 1976 , and its officers decided to put an end to his activities .
armed with a pistol , gartenschläger headed to the border in search of his third sm 70 .
what happened after that is uncertain .
during the first trial , witnesses testified that gartenschläger fired first and the east germans fired back .
but no gunpowder was found on gartenschläger 's hand .
after hearing the testimony , the judge said that everything was possible but that " nothing can be proven . "
and he acquitted the three defendants . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de play sheds light on dark east german secret a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .

he said he reckoned with a " constructive atmosphere " during consultations between schröder and berlusconi .
even the italian ambassador to germany , silvio fagiolo , played down the differences between rome and berlin on the iraq crisis .
" in the iraq question , the gap is not so big as one thinks , " he said in an interview with a german radio station .
he said italian premier berlusconi was always convinced that a peaceful solution is the best way .
protests against berlusconi in bremen about a 1000 people participated in a demonstration in bremen against berlusconi 's visit on thursday evening .
activists protested against a looming war against iraq as well as against berlusconi 's controversial judicial reform in italy , from which the prime minister himself is believed to profit the most .
the demonstrations in bremen however passed without incident .
the 25th german-italian summit was initially supposed to last two days , but was cut down to one on account of german foreign minister joschka fischer ’ s trip to new york to the u.n. security council , where chief weapons inspector , hans blix is expected to present his new report on friday .
other than the central topic of iraq , berlusconi and schröder were to discuss a host of other european issues such as the work of the eu convention , italy ’ s upcoming presidency of the eu in july and the controversial european satellite project , galileo . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plots next move in fight against iraqi war foreign minister joschka fischer has abruptly changed his schedule and is heading to paris for talks , while the german peace movement gears up for " day x , " the day when fighting in iraq may start .

the goal is to have the rules in place by the 2004-2005 school year . jürgen plenefisch has learned one thing about the german school system in his years in the country 's classrooms - grades do n't always mean a lot .
" as long as there are no official standards , every school has been judging performance based on its own criteria , " the berlin teacher said this week .
" because teachers have been unable to compare notes , to look outside the school door , so to speak , these standards became entrenched . "
the issue also has drawn the attention of education officials from germany 's 16 states who are charged with setting education policy .
" for the same type of work , different grades are given in different schools , " said karin wolff , who chairs the officials ' group .
work on standards pushed as a result of these discrepancies , education officials decided on thursday evening to intensify their work on national education standards , something germany has not had in the past because the individual states are responsible for education .
the leaders ' goal is to complete the standards this year and have the binding regulations in place for all schools by the 2004-2005 school year .
the standards will establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the first standards are to be completed by the summer , and will cover german , english , math , french , biology and physics .
in german reading comprehension , for instance , a student would achieve the minimum level if he or she could understand a simple text .
a student who could read between the lines would be ranked at the highest level .
the officials made their decision as they continued to explore the causes of the country 's weak performance on an international test known as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- .
fifteen-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the tests conducted in 2000 .

" when i have a sentence like ' the duck swims to the bank and disappears into the bushes , ' you have to explain the word ' bank ' and ' bushes ' because they are foreign words to the children , " rajewski said .

sharp differences between the german and italian stance towards the iraq crisis became apparent after a hasty round of talks between chancellor schröder and prime minister berlusconi in bremen on thursday evening . not much trace of the optimism expressed by representatives from the german and italian administrations ahead of a meeting between chancellor gerhard schröder and prime minister silvio berlusconi was in evidence after talks between the two heads of state on thursday evening .
instead the gap between germany and italy on the issue of iraq could hardly have been more apparent .
" one could hardly expect anything else , " schröder said after the 25th german-italian summit in bremen .
" no need for second resolution " - german chancellor the chancellor reasserted his position by rejecting any new security council resolution on iraq at present .
" we ’ re of the opinion that we don ’ t need any second resolution at the moment , " he said .
schröder repeated that germany , which has joined forces with france and russia in favor of a peaceful disarming of iraq , " would remain with that position . "
when asked whether he was aware of a british initiative , which foresaw providing saddam hussein with a short-term ultimatum to disarm , the chancellor replied , " i know of the announcement , but i don ’ t know the text . "
schröder said he couldn ’ t merely speculate on it , but added that had no objection to the weapons inspectors being given time to complete their work in iraq .
italian premier sticks to hardline stance italian prime minister berlusconi stuck to his stated line and described a new resolution as " welcome " , but not necessary for a military strike against iraq .
he said it was understandable that the u.s. and great britain were trying to garner a consensus with respect to the second resolution .
at the same time , the italian premier bemoaned iraq ’ s lack of cooperation with weapons inspectors so far .
without full cooperation , " the results of the inspections would remain modest , " he said .
italy has for long supported the hard line adopted by the united states , great britain and spain on the iraq question .
unlike germany , which is a temporary member of the security council , italy is not represented on it .

but at the end of talks with schröder , berlusconi softened his stance by stressing that his country also wanted a peaceful solution to the crisis .
leaders optimistic ahead of summit ahead of the summit , german foreign minister joschka fischer , told the italian newspaper corriere della sera that the german-italian summit provided an excellent opportunity to bring together the efforts of the two countries on the iraq issue .
" we ’ re both close allies of the united states , but we ’ re also guarantors for european development , " fischer said .
spokesman for the german government , bela anda admitted that the two administrations represented opposing views on the iraq issue , but said , " it doesn ’ t change the good cooperation between the two countries . "
he said he reckoned with a " constructive atmosphere " during consultations between schröder and berlusconi .
even the italian ambassador to germany , silvio fagiolo , played down the differences between rome and berlin on the iraq crisis .
" in the iraq question , the gap is not so big as one thinks , " he said in an interview with a german radio station .
he said italian premier berlusconi was always convinced that a peaceful solution is the best way .
protests against berlusconi in bremen about a 1000 people participated in a demonstration in bremen against berlusconi 's visit on thursday evening .

the 25th german-italian summit was initially supposed to last two days , but was cut down to one on account of german foreign minister joschka fischer ’ s trip to new york to the u.n. security council , where chief weapons inspector , hans blix is expected to present his new report on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2003 boeing seeks to strengthen role in german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new best friends : phil condit -lrb- left -rrb- and horst teltschik .
boeing , the troubled u.s. aerospace company , is looking for new markets in germany .
it 's hoping horst teltschik , former chancellor helmut kohl 's security adviser , can help . at a time when trans-atlantic relations are particularly frosty , boeing , the u.s.-based aerospace company , made an unusual move this week by hiring german power-broker horst teltschik as an adviser .
his mission : to look for lucrative business opportunities in his home country and help give the ailing aerospace giant a much-needed shot in the arm . " i 'm no ordinary lobbyist , " says teltschik .
indeed , he was a security adviser to former chancellor helmut kohl who has also served as a top executive at many firms , including bmw .
but when teltschik reached bmw 's mandatory retirement age two years ago , the carmaker sent him packing . one company 's loss , so it would seem , is another 's gain .
" the great thing about american firms is that age does n't matter - only your level of experience , " he says . boeing , no doubt , is hoping to take advantage of teltschik 's gold-plated connections and gain a foothold in the german market - potentially worth over $ 100 billion over the next 20 years .
that 's money in the bank for a company that 's been struggling financially , mostly due to increased competition from its arch rival , europe-based airbus , and the ripple effects of sept .
11 , 2001 . making up for big losses airbus dealt boeing a serious blow this past november .
the company , a division of the european aeronautic defence & space co .
-lrb- eads -rrb- , surpassed boeing 's sales for the first time in its 30-year history , posting an order backlog of 1,470 planes - 318 more than its stateside rival .
philippe camus , eads 's executive director , threw a huge party in paris to mark the occasion , inviting jazz musician wynton marsalis to play for the crowd . it 's not that phil condit , boeing 's ceo , does n't like jazz , but he 's hoping there wo n't be a repeat performance .
however , he acknowledges that boeing has some pretty serious hurdles to overcome . " the current situation in the airline industry is difficult the world over , but particularly in the united states .
a combination of the economic downturn - the first indications of which we saw in the fall of 2001 - and , of course , the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have dramatically affected the airline industry , " he says .
" the u.s. market has n't bounced back to the level it was three years ago . " it looks likely that airbus will continue to pose stiff competition in the year to come .
boeing 's sales over the last two years have declined from 527 planes in 2001 to a projected 280 in 2003 .

boeing , the troubled u.s. aerospace company , is looking for new markets in germany .
it 's hoping horst teltschik , former chancellor helmut kohl 's security adviser , can help . at a time when trans-atlantic relations are particularly frosty , boeing , the u.s.-based aerospace company , made an unusual move this week by hiring german power-broker horst teltschik as an adviser .
his mission : to look for lucrative business opportunities in his home country and help give the ailing aerospace giant a much-needed shot in the arm . " i 'm no ordinary lobbyist , " says teltschik .
indeed , he was a security adviser to former chancellor helmut kohl who has also served as a top executive at many firms , including bmw .
but when teltschik reached bmw 's mandatory retirement age two years ago , the carmaker sent him packing . one company 's loss , so it would seem , is another 's gain .
" the great thing about american firms is that age does n't matter - only your level of experience , " he says . boeing , no doubt , is hoping to take advantage of teltschik 's gold-plated connections and gain a foothold in the german market - potentially worth over $ 100 billion over the next 20 years .
that 's money in the bank for a company that 's been struggling financially , mostly due to increased competition from its arch rival , europe-based airbus , and the ripple effects of sept .
11 , 2001 . making up for big losses airbus dealt boeing a serious blow this past november .
the company , a division of the european aeronautic defence & space co .
-lrb- eads -rrb- , surpassed boeing 's sales for the first time in its 30-year history , posting an order backlog of 1,470 planes - 318 more than its stateside rival .
philippe camus , eads 's executive director , threw a huge party in paris to mark the occasion , inviting jazz musician wynton marsalis to play for the crowd . it 's not that phil condit , boeing 's ceo , does n't like jazz , but he 's hoping there wo n't be a repeat performance .
however , he acknowledges that boeing has some pretty serious hurdles to overcome . " the current situation in the airline industry is difficult the world over , but particularly in the united states .
a combination of the economic downturn - the first indications of which we saw in the fall of 2001 - and , of course , the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have dramatically affected the airline industry , " he says .
" the u.s. market has n't bounced back to the level it was three years ago . " it looks likely that airbus will continue to pose stiff competition in the year to come .

boeing , the troubled u.s. aerospace company , is looking for new markets in germany .
it 's hoping horst teltschik , former chancellor helmut kohl 's security adviser , can help . at a time when trans-atlantic relations are particularly frosty , boeing , the u.s.-based aerospace company , made an unusual move this week by hiring german power-broker horst teltschik as an adviser .
his mission : to look for lucrative business opportunities in his home country and help give the ailing aerospace giant a much-needed shot in the arm . " i 'm no ordinary lobbyist , " says teltschik .
indeed , he was a security adviser to former chancellor helmut kohl who has also served as a top executive at many firms , including bmw .
but when teltschik reached bmw 's mandatory retirement age two years ago , the carmaker sent him packing . one company 's loss , so it would seem , is another 's gain .
" the great thing about american firms is that age does n't matter - only your level of experience , " he says . boeing , no doubt , is hoping to take advantage of teltschik 's gold-plated connections and gain a foothold in the german market - potentially worth over $ 100 billion over the next 20 years .
that 's money in the bank for a company that 's been struggling financially , mostly due to increased competition from its arch rival , europe-based airbus , and the ripple effects of sept .
11 , 2001 . making up for big losses airbus dealt boeing a serious blow this past november .
the company , a division of the european aeronautic defence & space co .
-lrb- eads -rrb- , surpassed boeing 's sales for the first time in its 30-year history , posting an order backlog of 1,470 planes - 318 more than its stateside rival .
philippe camus , eads 's executive director , threw a huge party in paris to mark the occasion , inviting jazz musician wynton marsalis to play for the crowd . it 's not that phil condit , boeing 's ceo , does n't like jazz , but he 's hoping there wo n't be a repeat performance .
however , he acknowledges that boeing has some pretty serious hurdles to overcome . " the current situation in the airline industry is difficult the world over , but particularly in the united states .
a combination of the economic downturn - the first indications of which we saw in the fall of 2001 - and , of course , the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have dramatically affected the airline industry , " he says .
" the u.s. market has n't bounced back to the level it was three years ago . " it looks likely that airbus will continue to pose stiff competition in the year to come .
boeing 's sales over the last two years have declined from 527 planes in 2001 to a projected 280 in 2003 .
airbus is expecting orders of 300 this year , 20 more than boeing .
low-cost airlines calling the shots the fate of both companies over the past year has largely been determined by orders from low-cost airlines .
in a troubled airline industry , these carriers are among the few raking in the profits - and placing orders for new airplanes . airbus signed a deal with the british airline easyjet in 2002 for 120 planes .
it was that order that helped airbus edge out boeing .
in a countermove , boeing recently secured a deal with the irish airline ryanair for 103 planes - worth more than $ 6 million . boeing may also make a comeback based on sales to the military , not the civilian , sector .
for 2002 , boeing 's military business had a profit of $ 1.7 billion on sales of $ 14 billion , up from a profit of $ 1.3 billion on sales of $ 12.5 billion in 2001 .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes .
it 's broken all box office records as well as walls between eastern and western germans . nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown last month at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
in the last two weeks , 1.8 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin !
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany . his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin . his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutschmarks .

in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin !
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany . his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin . his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutschmarks .

germany is bracing itself for some racy television action as it selects its entry for the eurovision song contest in a live final broadcast on friday night and picks its " pop idol " on saturday . germany is gearing up for a double-helping of trash television this weekend .
on friday evening , the nation will decide who will represent germany in this year 's eurovision song contest , the europe-wide annual music event .
and on saturday evening , after months of tabloid hype and massive audience ratings , millions are likely to be glued to their sets as the final of the german version of cult reality tv show " pop idol " , -lrb- " deutschland sucht den superstar " - ' germany searches for its superstar ' -rrb- gets underway .
the build-up to both competitions has been marred by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illness .
" superstar " finalist alexander klaws -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is regarded as the ' housewife 's choice ' , has been languishing in bed all week with flu , prompting speculation that fellow finalist daniel küblböck , would step in to replace him .
until last week , when the 17-year-old bavarian was voted off the show , küblböck was the most prominent of the teen pop idolettes .
but at the last minute , doctors gave klaws the all-clear , dashing küblböck 's second chance to become germany 's pop idol .
the live " superstar " final between 19-year-old klaws and 22- year-old juliette schoppmann , a musical singer from hamburg , will be broadcast on private channel , rtl2 live from cologne .
as in the british and american versions of the same show , the winner receives a recording contract and will be catapulted into the lime light .
further north , in kiel , elmar brandt is doubtless the most interesting candidate to represent germany at the eurovision song contest on may 24 in riga , latvia . brandt too is under the weather , recovering from a bout of tonsilitis .
better known as the gerhard schröder impersonator - who shot into the limelight some months ago with his " tax song " - brandt will perform alongside a rubber " spitting image " -style puppet of the german chancellor if he makes it to the eurovision .
however , his record company , warner music told dw-world on friday he was now well enough to perform " send schröder to latvia " brandt is one of 14 finalists who will battle it out in the preliminary contest broadcast live from kiel this evening .
he is , however , the only one to have made into the top 40 with his eurovision offering , " alles wird gut " -lrb- " everything will be ok " . -rrb-
the song , which is a satirical attack on the failings of the schröder government as it battles to help its ailing economy out of recession , is currently at number 18 in the german charts .
he is currently the bookies ' favourite and german tabloid , bild has been backing brandt 's campaign to " schick schröder nach lettland " -lrb- send schröder to latvia . -rrb-
various german celebrities , including german prince of pop , dieter bohlen and pop idol wannabe , daniel küblböck are backing the 31-year-old from köln who also has a satirical sketch radio show , " die gerd show " -lrb- the gerd show . -rrb-
with political satire usually the reserve of the left wing , brandt 's use of it is surprising , not least because it lambasts the current german government over its reform packages and tax hikes .
the conservative cdu party used part of the song , offering it as a free download on its official website , before being forced to remove it after the record company complained .
however , brandt contends that he is not affiliated to any political party , conservative or otherwise .
" we see ourselves as neutral , as political observers , " peter bortz who wrote the lyrics to " alles wird gut " told dw- world .
" we 've done things in the past which have been very positive towards the chancellor , " he added . and for those for whom eurovision is all about the collective experience , help is at hand .

germany is bracing itself for some racy television action as it selects its entry for the eurovision song contest in a live final broadcast on friday night and picks its " pop idol " on saturday . germany is gearing up for a double-helping of trash television this weekend .
on friday evening , the nation will decide who will represent germany in this year 's eurovision song contest , the europe-wide annual music event .
and on saturday evening , after months of tabloid hype and massive audience ratings , millions are likely to be glued to their sets as the final of the german version of cult reality tv show " pop idol " , -lrb- " deutschland sucht den superstar " - ' germany searches for its superstar ' -rrb- gets underway .
the build-up to both competitions has been marred by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illness .
" superstar " finalist alexander klaws -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is regarded as the ' housewife 's choice ' , has been languishing in bed all week with flu , prompting speculation that fellow finalist daniel küblböck , would step in to replace him .
until last week , when the 17-year-old bavarian was voted off the show , küblböck was the most prominent of the teen pop idolettes .
but at the last minute , doctors gave klaws the all-clear , dashing küblböck 's second chance to become germany 's pop idol .
the live " superstar " final between 19-year-old klaws and 22- year-old juliette schoppmann , a musical singer from hamburg , will be broadcast on private channel , rtl2 live from cologne .
as in the british and american versions of the same show , the winner receives a recording contract and will be catapulted into the lime light .
further north , in kiel , elmar brandt is doubtless the most interesting candidate to represent germany at the eurovision song contest on may 24 in riga , latvia . brandt too is under the weather , recovering from a bout of tonsilitis .
better known as the gerhard schröder impersonator - who shot into the limelight some months ago with his " tax song " - brandt will perform alongside a rubber " spitting image " -style puppet of the german chancellor if he makes it to the eurovision .
however , his record company , warner music told dw-world on friday he was now well enough to perform " send schröder to latvia " brandt is one of 14 finalists who will battle it out in the preliminary contest broadcast live from kiel this evening .
he is , however , the only one to have made into the top 40 with his eurovision offering , " alles wird gut " -lrb- " everything will be ok " . -rrb-
the song , which is a satirical attack on the failings of the schröder government as it battles to help its ailing economy out of recession , is currently at number 18 in the german charts .
he is currently the bookies ' favourite and german tabloid , bild has been backing brandt 's campaign to " schick schröder nach lettland " -lrb- send schröder to latvia . -rrb-
various german celebrities , including german prince of pop , dieter bohlen and pop idol wannabe , daniel küblböck are backing the 31-year-old from köln who also has a satirical sketch radio show , " die gerd show " -lrb- the gerd show . -rrb-
with political satire usually the reserve of the left wing , brandt 's use of it is surprising , not least because it lambasts the current german government over its reform packages and tax hikes .
the conservative cdu party used part of the song , offering it as a free download on its official website , before being forced to remove it after the record company complained .
however , brandt contends that he is not affiliated to any political party , conservative or otherwise .
" we see ourselves as neutral , as political observers , " peter bortz who wrote the lyrics to " alles wird gut " told dw- world .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes .
it 's broken all box office records as well as walls between eastern and western germans . nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown last month at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
in the last two weeks , 1.8 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin !
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany . his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin . his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutschmarks .

but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .
what the vote in the house of commons showed was that a substantial minority , but still a minority , of the members of the house of commons had doubts at that stage whether military action was then warranted .
the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .
britain is a state which only undertakes or supports military action if it is compatible with the rule of international law .
and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.03.2003 british ambassador to germany : ' we share a common goal in iraq ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir paul lever , the british ambassador to germany in an exclusive interview with dw-world , britain 's ambassador to germany explains his country 's position in the iraq conflict and its implications for german-british relations . on friday , the british government continued its diplomatic efforts to find a compromise on a second u.n. resolution on iraq ahead of a new report from chief weapons inspector hans blix on the progress of disarmament efforts . speaking earlier this week , british prime minister tony blair said he was confident the united nations would pass a second resolution .
but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .
what the vote in the house of commons showed was that a substantial minority , but still a minority , of the members of the house of commons had doubts at that stage whether military action was then warranted .
the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .
britain is a state which only undertakes or supports military action if it is compatible with the rule of international law .
and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .
britain is a state which only undertakes or supports military action if it is compatible with the rule of international law .
and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .

germany is bracing itself for some racy television action as it selects its entry for the eurovision song contest in a live final broadcast on friday night and picks its " pop idol " on saturday . germany is gearing up for a double-helping of trash television this weekend .
on friday evening , the nation will decide who will represent germany in this year 's eurovision song contest , the europe-wide annual music event .
and on saturday evening , after months of tabloid hype and massive audience ratings , millions are likely to be glued to their sets as the final of the german version of cult reality tv show " pop idol " , -lrb- " deutschland sucht den superstar " - ' germany searches for its superstar ' -rrb- gets underway .
the build-up to both competitions has been marred by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illness .
" superstar " finalist alexander klaws -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is regarded as the ' housewife 's choice ' , has been languishing in bed all week with flu , prompting speculation that fellow finalist daniel küblböck , would step in to replace him .
until last week , when the 17-year-old bavarian was voted off the show , küblböck was the most prominent of the teen pop idolettes .
but at the last minute , doctors gave klaws the all-clear , dashing küblböck 's second chance to become germany 's pop idol .
the live " superstar " final between 19-year-old klaws and 22- year-old juliette schoppmann , a musical singer from hamburg , will be broadcast on private channel , rtl2 live from cologne .
as in the british and american versions of the same show , the winner receives a recording contract and will be catapulted into the lime light .
further north , in kiel , elmar brandt is doubtless the most interesting candidate to represent germany at the eurovision song contest on may 24 in riga , latvia . brandt too is under the weather , recovering from a bout of tonsilitis .
better known as the gerhard schröder impersonator - who shot into the limelight some months ago with his " tax song " - brandt will perform alongside a rubber " spitting image " -style puppet of the german chancellor if he makes it to the eurovision .
however , his record company , warner music told dw-world on friday he was now well enough to perform " send schröder to latvia " brandt is one of 14 finalists who will battle it out in the preliminary contest broadcast live from kiel this evening .
he is , however , the only one to have made into the top 40 with his eurovision offering , " alles wird gut " -lrb- " everything will be ok " . -rrb-
the song , which is a satirical attack on the failings of the schröder government as it battles to help its ailing economy out of recession , is currently at number 18 in the german charts .
he is currently the bookies ' favourite and german tabloid , bild has been backing brandt 's campaign to " schick schröder nach lettland " -lrb- send schröder to latvia . -rrb-
various german celebrities , including german prince of pop , dieter bohlen and pop idol wannabe , daniel küblböck are backing the 31-year-old from köln who also has a satirical sketch radio show , " die gerd show " -lrb- the gerd show . -rrb-
with political satire usually the reserve of the left wing , brandt 's use of it is surprising , not least because it lambasts the current german government over its reform packages and tax hikes .
the conservative cdu party used part of the song , offering it as a free download on its official website , before being forced to remove it after the record company complained .
however , brandt contends that he is not affiliated to any political party , conservative or otherwise .
" we see ourselves as neutral , as political observers , " peter bortz who wrote the lyrics to " alles wird gut " told dw- world .
" we 've done things in the past which have been very positive towards the chancellor , " he added . and for those for whom eurovision is all about the collective experience , help is at hand .

germany is bracing itself for some racy television action as it selects its entry for the eurovision song contest in a live final broadcast on friday night and picks its " pop idol " on saturday . germany is gearing up for a double-helping of trash television this weekend .
on friday evening , the nation will decide who will represent germany in this year 's eurovision song contest , the europe-wide annual music event .
and on saturday evening , after months of tabloid hype and massive audience ratings , millions are likely to be glued to their sets as the final of the german version of cult reality tv show " pop idol " , -lrb- " deutschland sucht den superstar " - ' germany searches for its superstar ' -rrb- gets underway .
the build-up to both competitions has been marred by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illness .
" superstar " finalist alexander klaws -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is regarded as the ' housewife 's choice ' , has been languishing in bed all week with flu , prompting speculation that fellow finalist daniel küblböck , would step in to replace him .
until last week , when the 17-year-old bavarian was voted off the show , küblböck was the most prominent of the teen pop idolettes .
but at the last minute , doctors gave klaws the all-clear , dashing küblböck 's second chance to become germany 's pop idol .
the live " superstar " final between 19-year-old klaws and 22- year-old juliette schoppmann , a musical singer from hamburg , will be broadcast on private channel , rtl2 live from cologne .
as in the british and american versions of the same show , the winner receives a recording contract and will be catapulted into the lime light .
further north , in kiel , elmar brandt is doubtless the most interesting candidate to represent germany at the eurovision song contest on may 24 in riga , latvia . brandt too is under the weather , recovering from a bout of tonsilitis .
better known as the gerhard schröder impersonator - who shot into the limelight some months ago with his " tax song " - brandt will perform alongside a rubber " spitting image " -style puppet of the german chancellor if he makes it to the eurovision .
however , his record company , warner music told dw-world on friday he was now well enough to perform " send schröder to latvia " brandt is one of 14 finalists who will battle it out in the preliminary contest broadcast live from kiel this evening .
he is , however , the only one to have made into the top 40 with his eurovision offering , " alles wird gut " -lrb- " everything will be ok " . -rrb-
the song , which is a satirical attack on the failings of the schröder government as it battles to help its ailing economy out of recession , is currently at number 18 in the german charts .
he is currently the bookies ' favourite and german tabloid , bild has been backing brandt 's campaign to " schick schröder nach lettland " -lrb- send schröder to latvia . -rrb-
various german celebrities , including german prince of pop , dieter bohlen and pop idol wannabe , daniel küblböck are backing the 31-year-old from köln who also has a satirical sketch radio show , " die gerd show " -lrb- the gerd show . -rrb-
with political satire usually the reserve of the left wing , brandt 's use of it is surprising , not least because it lambasts the current german government over its reform packages and tax hikes .
the conservative cdu party used part of the song , offering it as a free download on its official website , before being forced to remove it after the record company complained .
however , brandt contends that he is not affiliated to any political party , conservative or otherwise .

the goal is to have the rules in place by the 2004-2005 school year . jürgen plenefisch has learned one thing about the german school system in his years in the country 's classrooms - grades do n't always mean a lot .
" as long as there are no official standards , every school has been judging performance based on its own criteria , " the berlin teacher said this week .
" because teachers have been unable to compare notes , to look outside the school door , so to speak , these standards became entrenched . "
the issue also has drawn the attention of education officials from germany 's 16 states who are charged with setting education policy .
" for the same type of work , different grades are given in different schools , " said karin wolff , who chairs the officials ' group .
work on standards pushed as a result of these discrepancies , education officials decided on thursday evening to intensify their work on national education standards , something germany has not had in the past because the individual states are responsible for education .
the leaders ' goal is to complete the standards this year and have the binding regulations in place for all schools by the 2004-2005 school year .
the standards will establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the first standards are to be completed by the summer , and will cover german , english , math , french , biology and physics .
in german reading comprehension , for instance , a student would achieve the minimum level if he or she could understand a simple text .
a student who could read between the lines would be ranked at the highest level .
the officials made their decision as they continued to explore the causes of the country 's weak performance on an international test known as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- .
fifteen-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the tests conducted in 2000 .
help for foreign students planned the analysis of the test results also showed that the schools , whose student bodies have more than 20 percent foreign children , experience a considerable drop in performance .
rainer rajewski , an elementary school teacher in berlin , has a class with 80 percent foreign pupils .
that means that his classes often turn into basic lessons in the german language .
" when i have a sentence like ' the duck swims to the bank and disappears into the bushes , ' you have to explain the word ' bank ' and ' bushes ' because they are foreign words to the children , " rajewski said .
the officials said they would push for foreign children to receive more individual attention and work to introduce programs aimed at improving the integration of these children in the schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany searching for education solutions an international test that german students took in 2000 forced officials to begin asking difficult questions about the country 's education system .
countries like sweden may help provide some of the answers .

but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .
what the vote in the house of commons showed was that a substantial minority , but still a minority , of the members of the house of commons had doubts at that stage whether military action was then warranted .
the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .
britain is a state which only undertakes or supports military action if it is compatible with the rule of international law .
and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

and the british government believes that there will be a second resolution and that this second resolution will confirm the international legitimacy of whatever serious consequences have to flow .
i use the term " serious consequences " because this is the wording of the resolution .
all our experience with saddam hussein suggests that if there is a chance of him complying with the demands of the united nations security council he will only do so at the very last minute and when he really perceives a credible imminent threat of the use of military force .
this is n't a comfortable idea for some people to live with , but it is our experience that it is the only realistic way of influencing saddam hussein 's behavior . the current iraq conflict has caused a rift in europe .
has the issue affected german-british relations ? german-british relations are extremely good and extremely close , particularly the relationship between gerhard schröder and tony blair .
we share a common goal in iraq , which is to see united nations resolutions implemented and iraq disarmed .
we have a difference in analysis over the best way of achieving that , but tony blair has all along said that he respects and understands the german position and understands in particular the reasons why germany is reluctant to contemplate the use of force and that the concerns which chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer have put about the consequences in the region are indeed valid and fair points . and apart from the governmental level ? there is a difference of view about one particular foreign policy issue - namely , how to handle iraq .
it is a very important issue , and one should n't minimize it or pretend that it is trivial .
of course , it 's not , but it is one specific foreign policy issue .
in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

but france , germany and russia have stressed that they would block the passage of any u.n. resolution authorizing a war against baghdad . though britain is washington 's staunchest ally in its campaign against iraq , the issue is just as divisive in london as it is in other european capitals .
last week , a parliamentary vote on an amendment that said the case for war " is as yet unproven " resulted in 120 members of parliament from blair 's own labour party voting in favor of the amendment .
the vote has been termed the biggest rebellion in the house of commons in 100 years . dw-world spoke to sir paul lever , britain 's ambassador to germany since 1997 , on the british position and british-german relations in the wake of the conflict . following the recent vote in the house of commons , and the latest opinion polls , which show 50-60 percent of the british population is against military action in iraq , why is blair so determined to make his case ? his conviction comes from his belief that iraq has to be disarmed and that allowing iraq to continue with its weapons of mass destruction , and its programs for acquiring more of them , is too dangerous to allow .
what the vote in the house of commons showed was that a substantial minority , but still a minority , of the members of the house of commons had doubts at that stage whether military action was then warranted .
the clear majority of the house of commons was in support of the government . the prime minister believes that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction and that unless he is disarmed these could prove a danger to the world .
is there something that he knows that we do n't ?
in germany , for example , people still have difficulties understanding his position . i would be surprised if there were many people in germany , at least among those who take a serious interest in the subject , who deny that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
there are reports from united nations inspectors , both previous ones and the present ones that show there are hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of tons of nerve agent , of anthrax agent , of chemical weapons that are unaccounted for .
he has twice used chemical weapons , once against his own people , once against iran .
he has failed to account for what happened to any of these weapons whose existence is well known and documented .
i do n't think there is much reasonable doubt that he has got these weapons and that he is trying to hang on to them .
there is , of course , a difference of view about the best way of securing the disarmament of iraq that we all want - but i do n't think there is anyone who seriously denies that there is a problem . though tony blair is pushing for a second resolution , there is still the possibility it could fail and that he would have to sanction military action without the cover of the united nations . what would this mean for blair , both nationally and internationally ? that 's an interesting hypothetical question , but one which remains hypothetical .

in general , the relationship between britain and germany is extremely close : we are partners in a whole range of business , within the european union and on the wider international scene .
the relationship between the two governments , particularly between the two heads of government , is the closest and best that i have experienced in my professional lifetime , and i started working for the foreign office in 1966 , so i go back quite a long way .
whatever differences we have on iraq do n't alter that . has the issue of iraq affected your work as an ambassador in berlin ? it is our job to present britain in germany , including the policies of the british government , including policies like iraq .
there is interest in what britain 's position is , why it is , what it is , and the embassy has a role to play in explaining that position , as we explain our government 's position on a range of other issues .
so , it is an item of business that we have to transact and conduct .
it 's what a lot of the media understandably are currently interested in , so in that sense , yes , it 's work for us , but it 's work that we are here to do .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes .
it 's broken all box office records as well as walls between eastern and western germans . nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown last month at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
in the last two weeks , 1.8 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin !
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany . his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .

sharp differences between the german and italian stance towards the iraq crisis became apparent after a hasty round of talks between chancellor schröder and prime minister berlusconi in bremen on thursday evening . not much trace of the optimism expressed by representatives from the german and italian administrations ahead of a meeting between chancellor gerhard schröder and prime minister silvio berlusconi was in evidence after talks between the two heads of state on thursday evening .
instead the gap between germany and italy on the issue of iraq could hardly have been more apparent .
" one could hardly expect anything else , " schröder said after the 25th german-italian summit in bremen .
" no need for second resolution " - german chancellor the chancellor reasserted his position by rejecting any new security council resolution on iraq at present .
" we ’ re of the opinion that we don ’ t need any second resolution at the moment , " he said .
schröder repeated that germany , which has joined forces with france and russia in favor of a peaceful disarming of iraq , " would remain with that position . "
when asked whether he was aware of a british initiative , which foresaw providing saddam hussein with a short-term ultimatum to disarm , the chancellor replied , " i know of the announcement , but i don ’ t know the text . "
schröder said he couldn ’ t merely speculate on it , but added that had no objection to the weapons inspectors being given time to complete their work in iraq .
italian premier sticks to hardline stance italian prime minister berlusconi stuck to his stated line and described a new resolution as " welcome " , but not necessary for a military strike against iraq .
he said it was understandable that the u.s. and great britain were trying to garner a consensus with respect to the second resolution .
at the same time , the italian premier bemoaned iraq ’ s lack of cooperation with weapons inspectors so far .
without full cooperation , " the results of the inspections would remain modest , " he said .
italy has for long supported the hard line adopted by the united states , great britain and spain on the iraq question .
unlike germany , which is a temporary member of the security council , italy is not represented on it .
the conservative italian premier is also against his troops participating in a military strike against iraq .
but at the end of talks with schröder , berlusconi softened his stance by stressing that his country also wanted a peaceful solution to the crisis .
leaders optimistic ahead of summit ahead of the summit , german foreign minister joschka fischer , told the italian newspaper corriere della sera that the german-italian summit provided an excellent opportunity to bring together the efforts of the two countries on the iraq issue .
" we ’ re both close allies of the united states , but we ’ re also guarantors for european development , " fischer said .
spokesman for the german government , bela anda admitted that the two administrations represented opposing views on the iraq issue , but said , " it doesn ’ t change the good cooperation between the two countries . "
he said he reckoned with a " constructive atmosphere " during consultations between schröder and berlusconi .
even the italian ambassador to germany , silvio fagiolo , played down the differences between rome and berlin on the iraq crisis .
" in the iraq question , the gap is not so big as one thinks , " he said in an interview with a german radio station .
he said italian premier berlusconi was always convinced that a peaceful solution is the best way .
protests against berlusconi in bremen about a 1000 people participated in a demonstration in bremen against berlusconi 's visit on thursday evening .
activists protested against a looming war against iraq as well as against berlusconi 's controversial judicial reform in italy , from which the prime minister himself is believed to profit the most .
the demonstrations in bremen however passed without incident .
the 25th german-italian summit was initially supposed to last two days , but was cut down to one on account of german foreign minister joschka fischer ’ s trip to new york to the u.n. security council , where chief weapons inspector , hans blix is expected to present his new report on friday .
other than the central topic of iraq , berlusconi and schröder were to discuss a host of other european issues such as the work of the eu convention , italy ’ s upcoming presidency of the eu in july and the controversial european satellite project , galileo . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plots next move in fight against iraqi war foreign minister joschka fischer has abruptly changed his schedule and is heading to paris for talks , while the german peace movement gears up for " day x , " the day when fighting in iraq may start .

" no need for second resolution " - german chancellor the chancellor reasserted his position by rejecting any new security council resolution on iraq at present .
" we ’ re of the opinion that we don ’ t need any second resolution at the moment , " he said .
schröder repeated that germany , which has joined forces with france and russia in favor of a peaceful disarming of iraq , " would remain with that position . "

boeing , the troubled u.s. aerospace company , is looking for new markets in germany .
it 's hoping horst teltschik , former chancellor helmut kohl 's security adviser , can help . at a time when trans-atlantic relations are particularly frosty , boeing , the u.s.-based aerospace company , made an unusual move this week by hiring german power-broker horst teltschik as an adviser .
his mission : to look for lucrative business opportunities in his home country and help give the ailing aerospace giant a much-needed shot in the arm . " i 'm no ordinary lobbyist , " says teltschik .
indeed , he was a security adviser to former chancellor helmut kohl who has also served as a top executive at many firms , including bmw .
but when teltschik reached bmw 's mandatory retirement age two years ago , the carmaker sent him packing . one company 's loss , so it would seem , is another 's gain .
" the great thing about american firms is that age does n't matter - only your level of experience , " he says . boeing , no doubt , is hoping to take advantage of teltschik 's gold-plated connections and gain a foothold in the german market - potentially worth over $ 100 billion over the next 20 years .
that 's money in the bank for a company that 's been struggling financially , mostly due to increased competition from its arch rival , europe-based airbus , and the ripple effects of sept .
11 , 2001 . making up for big losses airbus dealt boeing a serious blow this past november .
the company , a division of the european aeronautic defence & space co .
-lrb- eads -rrb- , surpassed boeing 's sales for the first time in its 30-year history , posting an order backlog of 1,470 planes - 318 more than its stateside rival .
philippe camus , eads 's executive director , threw a huge party in paris to mark the occasion , inviting jazz musician wynton marsalis to play for the crowd . it 's not that phil condit , boeing 's ceo , does n't like jazz , but he 's hoping there wo n't be a repeat performance .
however , he acknowledges that boeing has some pretty serious hurdles to overcome . " the current situation in the airline industry is difficult the world over , but particularly in the united states .
a combination of the economic downturn - the first indications of which we saw in the fall of 2001 - and , of course , the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have dramatically affected the airline industry , " he says .
" the u.s. market has n't bounced back to the level it was three years ago . " it looks likely that airbus will continue to pose stiff competition in the year to come .
boeing 's sales over the last two years have declined from 527 planes in 2001 to a projected 280 in 2003 .
airbus is expecting orders of 300 this year , 20 more than boeing .
low-cost airlines calling the shots the fate of both companies over the past year has largely been determined by orders from low-cost airlines .
in a troubled airline industry , these carriers are among the few raking in the profits - and placing orders for new airplanes . airbus signed a deal with the british airline easyjet in 2002 for 120 planes .
it was that order that helped airbus edge out boeing .
in a countermove , boeing recently secured a deal with the irish airline ryanair for 103 planes - worth more than $ 6 million . boeing may also make a comeback based on sales to the military , not the civilian , sector .
for 2002 , boeing 's military business had a profit of $ 1.7 billion on sales of $ 14 billion , up from a profit of $ 1.3 billion on sales of $ 12.5 billion in 2001 .
the company will likely benefit from increased defense spending in the united states .
president george w. bush has proposed raising defense spending by $ 120 billion to $ 451 billion by 2007 . eads has a less-developed defense sector - airbus , its commercial aircraft division , accounts for more than 80 percent of the company 's profits . be they hard-fought gains in the commercial airline industry or increased business from the military sector , condit thinks boeing 's future looks bright .
" our business is one-of-a-kind - it 's very long term , " he says .
" whether or not we get military or civil orders , both will last us over the long run . " trans-atlantic tensions not a problem teltschik and condit met this week in berlin to discuss strategy .
but , as is so often the case when americans and germans get together these days , the strained trans-atlantic relationship was up for discussion .
despite recent rumblings that tensions might spill over into the business sector , neither believes there will be long-term negative implications . " governments come and go , and the current crisis is between one administration and another - not between the two countries , " says teltschik , a self-proclaimed atlanticist .
condit concurs : " relations , over the long term , are good - and they will stay that way ; there may be problems here and there , but compare that to the past and look where we are today . " both are hoping their transatlantic partnership will be long lasting - and profitable .
with $ 100 billion at stake , they certainly have enough incentive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus finds the friendly skies following a dreadful last half year , europe 's mega air consortium , airbus , has reason to smile and gain some ground on old nemesis boeing .

revenue could be up to 2.7 % lower than the previous year , the firm admitted in its latest update to the stock markets .
" we have n't seen anything yet that we would call a corporate recovery , " the firm 's financial officer andy bryant said .
intel said sales of computer microprocessors were slightly higher than expected but that weak sales of chips for mobile phones and other electronic devices dragged the overall outlook lower .
just three weeks ago , intel chief executive craig barrett told a forum that technology firms had several reasons to expect business to improve over the next 12 months .
barometer the california-based company is seen as a barometer for the chip industry which is struggling to recover from its worst ever downturn .
the chip market , in turn , is often seen as a signal of any recovery in the wider technology market .
the global semiconductor market is forecast to grow by 9 % this year with total sales of $ 167bn , according to gartner .
intel has long been predicting a rush of spending by firms updating computer systems , but the hoped-for corporate spending is being slow to emerge .
intel stock fell by 4 % in after hours trade following the announcement .

this has been a complex and ambitious policy to deliver " maureen o 'neill , age concern scotland the charity 's report suggested waiting times were problematic and some people found it difficult to choose between different care home providers .
researchers recommended a revised strategy to provide information on all aspects of community care .
free personal and nursing care was first recommended in a report by sir stewart sutherland in march 1999 but the scottish executive refused to adopt the entire proposals .
in january 2001 , the executive performed a u-turn minutes before it looked like losing a crucial parliamentary vote .

president pat watters said only four of scotland 's 32 local authorities had raised concerns over funding and only one of those was predicting that it would run over budget .
he said : " it is absolutely ludicrous of them to suggest that this policy is breaking down - indeed the implementation of free personal care is a tremendous success .

' resources adequate ' deputy health minister frank mcaveety insisted the executive and cosla had been rigorously assessing the progress of free personal care and were satisfied with its implementation .
mr mcaveety also claimed that some of the information in the report was anecdotal and out of date .

" resources are more than adequate .
we have committed £ 250m over two years .

the study by charity age concern scotland said there was still confusion about what personal care actually means .
and some councils were unsure if they had enough cash to meet demands , it also stated .
but the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- , said the report did not accurately reflect how community care was working .
this has been a complex and ambitious policy to deliver maureen o 'neill , age concern scotland the charity 's report suggested waiting times were problematic and some people found it difficult to choose between different care home providers .
researchers recommended a revised strategy to provide information on all aspects of community care .
free personal and nursing care was first recommended in a report by sir stewart sutherland in march 1999 but the scottish executive refused to adopt the entire proposals .
in january 2001 , the executive performed a u-turn minutes before it looked like losing a crucial parliamentary vote .
' areas for action ' maureen o 'neil , age concern scotland director , said the report was a " snapshot " of issues that indicated potential problems .
she said : " this has been a complex and ambitious policy to deliver , and we acknowledge how successful it has been .
" however there are still areas for action .
our survey showed that there is a need for a continuing information strategy , to ensure that older people can find out about what is available when they need it .
" we want to be sure that the money intended for community care services is spent appropriately , and we therefore want to see clear and transparent accounting of the specifically allocated resources . "
it is absolutely ludicrous of them to suggest that this policy is breaking down cosla president pat watters cosla , however , said the charity was wrong to suggest councils were worried about funding the new care demands .
president pat watters said only four of scotland 's 32 local authorities had raised concerns over funding and only one of those was predicting that it would run over budget .
he said : " it is absolutely ludicrous of them to suggest that this policy is breaking down - indeed the implementation of free personal care is a tremendous success .
" this is a new and extremely complex policy from which there was always going to be minor issues that needed picked up along the way - and we are doing this in partnership with the executive . "
' resources adequate ' deputy health minister frank mcaveety insisted the executive and cosla had been rigorously assessing the progress of free personal care and were satisfied with its implementation .
mr mcaveety also claimed that some of the information in the report was anecdotal and out of date .
" we simply do not recognise the very negative picture painted by this report , " he added .
" resources are more than adequate .
we have committed £ 250m over two years .
" there should be no waiting lists and those assessed should receive free personal care . "
