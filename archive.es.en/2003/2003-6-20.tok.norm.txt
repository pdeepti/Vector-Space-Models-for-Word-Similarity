despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .
america is the home of the computer and i want to be along for the ride , " he said . hopes to boost germany 's ailing it sector with the german it sector in a funk , the hope is the high quality " made in germany " tag will be well received on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have a lot of innovation to offer , " bernhard rohleder from bitkom , the sector 's largest umbrella organization , said . " the computer , as well as the fax machine or phillip reiss ' speech transmission technology were all developed first in germany , " rohleder said . with bitkom warning that a further 10,000 jobs in germany could go in an industry which already shelved 35,000 positions last year .
the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market . " we hope to be able to export the german trade fair concept to america and make it easier for german firms to penetrate the u.s. market , " rohleder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .

the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .

former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing will formally hand over a draft constitution to eu leaders on friday . over the last 16 months , 105 delegates to a constitution convention headed by giscard have hammered out details of a document that will hopefully prepare the eu as it enlarges to 25 countries next year .
while the majority of the most controversial issues have been laid to rest , a few eu governments are expected to do some final tinkering at the greek summit .
europe 's leaders are also expected to haggle over how best to handle immigration and asylum issues on a eu-wide basis , discussing as well the long-overdue reform of the common agricultural policy . the future leadership of the european central bank is also on tap , with france almost certain to nominate bank of france govenor jean-claude trichet to succeed ecb presdent wim duisenberg . dw-world has pulled together recent articles relevant to the summit . dw-world.de european central bank heir apparent cleared of fraud changes bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2003 an end to amusement park deutschland ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german workers enjoy six weeks of annual paid vacation .
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.06.2003 turkey takes the cultural route to the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big coup - turkey 's sertab erener , center , won the eurovision song contest in latvia last month .
turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing will formally hand over a draft constitution to eu leaders on friday . over the last 16 months , 105 delegates to a constitution convention headed by giscard have hammered out details of a document that will hopefully prepare the eu as it enlarges to 25 countries next year .
while the majority of the most controversial issues have been laid to rest , a few eu governments are expected to do some final tinkering at the greek summit .
europe 's leaders are also expected to haggle over how best to handle immigration and asylum issues on a eu-wide basis , discussing as well the long-overdue reform of the common agricultural policy . the future leadership of the european central bank is also on tap , with france almost certain to nominate bank of france govenor jean-claude trichet to succeed ecb presdent wim duisenberg . dw-world has pulled together recent articles relevant to the summit . dw-world.de european central bank heir apparent cleared of fraud changes bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .

the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .
america is the home of the computer and i want to be along for the ride , " he said . hopes to boost germany 's ailing it sector with the german it sector in a funk , the hope is the high quality " made in germany " tag will be well received on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have a lot of innovation to offer , " bernhard rohleder from bitkom , the sector 's largest umbrella organization , said . " the computer , as well as the fax machine or phillip reiss ' speech transmission technology were all developed first in germany , " rohleder said . with bitkom warning that a further 10,000 jobs in germany could go in an industry which already shelved 35,000 positions last year .
the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market . " we hope to be able to export the german trade fair concept to america and make it easier for german firms to penetrate the u.s. market , " rohleder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2003 an end to amusement park deutschland ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german workers enjoy six weeks of annual paid vacation .
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .

the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2003 an end to amusement park deutschland ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german workers enjoy six weeks of annual paid vacation .
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .
america is the home of the computer and i want to be along for the ride , " he said . hopes to boost germany 's ailing it sector with the german it sector in a funk , the hope is the high quality " made in germany " tag will be well received on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have a lot of innovation to offer , " bernhard rohleder from bitkom , the sector 's largest umbrella organization , said . " the computer , as well as the fax machine or phillip reiss ' speech transmission technology were all developed first in germany , " rohleder said . with bitkom warning that a further 10,000 jobs in germany could go in an industry which already shelved 35,000 positions last year .
the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market . " we hope to be able to export the german trade fair concept to america and make it easier for german firms to penetrate the u.s. market , " rohleder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .
america is the home of the computer and i want to be along for the ride , " he said . hopes to boost germany 's ailing it sector with the german it sector in a funk , the hope is the high quality " made in germany " tag will be well received on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have a lot of innovation to offer , " bernhard rohleder from bitkom , the sector 's largest umbrella organization , said . " the computer , as well as the fax machine or phillip reiss ' speech transmission technology were all developed first in germany , " rohleder said . with bitkom warning that a further 10,000 jobs in germany could go in an industry which already shelved 35,000 positions last year .
the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market . " we hope to be able to export the german trade fair concept to america and make it easier for german firms to penetrate the u.s. market , " rohleder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .

the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

despite high hopes , attendance has been low as the it sector continues to suffer through a global downturn . german research minister edelgard buhlmann banged the drum hard for the ailing german it industry yesterday as the germany 's high-tech trade fair , cebit , opened in new york for the first time on wednesday . " i hope that american firms , but also companies from other countries taking part in this fair invest in germany , " she said . cebit america is the latest international stop for the annual information and technology fair .
in the last two years , the fair - the world 's largest - which is normally based in hanover , germany , has been held in shanghai , istanbul and sydney . in her opening speech buhlmann said investing in germany was still a good option , despite the country 's current economic malaise . " germany is a very attractive place to invest .
we have the lowest corporate tax and highly educated and motivated people .
we have excellent research facilities and infrastructure .
it 's simply worth it to invest in our country , " she continued . a slow start stateside but buhlmann 's rallying cry for investment in the ailing german it sector may have fallen on deaf ears , as the three-day-long fair on the banks of the hudson river got off to a slow start . although big names like hewlett packard , chipmaker intel , sony and microsoft are in attendance at manhattan 's javit convention center , just 400 exhibiters from 15 countries in total are presenting the latest developments in technology and telecommunications .
that 's a far cry from the 6,526 companies who displayed their wares in hanover in march this year . but the organizers , who expect as many as 20,000 to shell out $ 150 for a ticket by the time the fair ends on friday , deny the fair 's first stateside saunter is a damp squid . " for a first exhibition -lrb- here -rrb- and in difficult economic times , to get 400 firms taking part is great start , " cebit chief ernst raue said . " cebit will make a name for itself in america , because the fair is a well-known brand worldwide .
in my opinion , america needs a trade fair like cebit . . .i do n't want to leave the way open for america to swallow up the competition .
america is the home of the computer and i want to be along for the ride , " he said . hopes to boost germany 's ailing it sector with the german it sector in a funk , the hope is the high quality " made in germany " tag will be well received on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have a lot of innovation to offer , " bernhard rohleder from bitkom , the sector 's largest umbrella organization , said . " the computer , as well as the fax machine or phillip reiss ' speech transmission technology were all developed first in germany , " rohleder said . with bitkom warning that a further 10,000 jobs in germany could go in an industry which already shelved 35,000 positions last year .
the prognosis for the it industry - suffering since the dotcom bubble burst at the start of the decade - remains bleak .
in 2002 , some 2,000 german high-tech firms disappeared from the market .
three-quarters of these , bitkom says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency .
now the sector is pinning its hopes on cebit america , in an attempt to give german technology companies access to the u.s. market . " we hope to be able to export the german trade fair concept to america and make it easier for german firms to penetrate the u.s. market , " rohleder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years .

while the majority of the most controversial issues have been laid to rest , a few eu governments are expected to do some final tinkering at the greek summit .
europe 's leaders are also expected to haggle over how best to handle immigration and asylum issues on a eu-wide basis , discussing as well the long-overdue reform of the common agricultural policy . the future leadership of the european central bank is also on tap , with france almost certain to nominate bank of france govenor jean-claude trichet to succeed ecb presdent wim duisenberg . dw-world has pulled together recent articles relevant to the summit . dw-world.de european central bank heir apparent cleared of fraud changes bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .

former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing will formally hand over a draft constitution to eu leaders on friday . over the last 16 months , 105 delegates to a constitution convention headed by giscard have hammered out details of a document that will hopefully prepare the eu as it enlarges to 25 countries next year .
while the majority of the most controversial issues have been laid to rest , a few eu governments are expected to do some final tinkering at the greek summit .
europe 's leaders are also expected to haggle over how best to handle immigration and asylum issues on a eu-wide basis , discussing as well the long-overdue reform of the common agricultural policy . the future leadership of the european central bank is also on tap , with france almost certain to nominate bank of france govenor jean-claude trichet to succeed ecb presdent wim duisenberg . dw-world has pulled together recent articles relevant to the summit . dw-world.de european central bank heir apparent cleared of fraud changes bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2003 an end to amusement park deutschland ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german workers enjoy six weeks of annual paid vacation .
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2003 an end to amusement park deutschland ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german workers enjoy six weeks of annual paid vacation .
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .
however , clement , who has insisted that he merely wants to " provide a thought-provoking stimulus " through the discussion , has received support from some quarters , including dieter phillip , the president of the german trade association and norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank .
michael rogowski , the head of the germany industry association , told the mass-circulation newspaper bild extending working hours might provide the impetus the germany economy needs . “ a nation won ’ t become richer when everyone continues to work less , like ig metall wants to achieve with its strikes , ” rogowski said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists . former german chancellor helmut kohl once famously called germany a " collective amusement park " because of the country 's numerous public holidays and the generous paid vacation workers receive .
now , as europe 's largest economy struggles with sluggish growth and surging unemployment , some politicians have begun to suggest germans roll up their sleeves and work more to get the country back in shape .
german economy minister wolfgang clement said this week the country could no longer afford to be such a worker ’ s paradise and that cutting public holidays would help spur economic growth by decreasing wage costs .
" we need to compete internationally .
i 'm not expecting wage costs like in china or taiwan but wages must become more competitive , " clement said on wednesday .
“ we have to ask ourselves whether we go on as usual or if we concentrate a bit more . ”
the discussion has riled the churches and unions , but clement ’ s timing could hardly have been better .
as politicians in berlin and much of the rest of the country go about work on thursday , citizens in predominately catholic states get to stay home for corpus christi .
the holiday may be important to the church , but whereas some german states have 13 public holidays a year , france has only 11 and britain makes do with eight .
too many holidays ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " when we compare the calendar of our public holidays with those of other states , then we really have something to worry about , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the stern magazine this week .
" as far as vacation , public holidays and working hours are concerned , we are without doubt at our limit . "
clement said a number of public holidays in germany , where unemployment has long hovered over ten percent , would fall on weekends next year , which in turn would have a positive impact on growth .
" all of a sudden , economic analysts predict an increased growth of about 0.5 percent .
now that ’ s something to celebrate and think about ! "
but not everyone is going along with clement ’ s zeal .
the financial expert of the greens in parliament , christine scheel has called the discussion " nonsense . "
she pointed out that unemployment in states which celebrate more than the usual nine nationwide holidays was lower compared to states , where people work more .
clement ’ s proposals have also been fiercely criticized by the catholic church .
cardinal karl lehmann said the religious holidays are much too important for one to be allowed to exploit them simply on the basis of economic growth .
he also told the daily saarbrücker zeitung that holidays belonged to the people and shouldn ’ t be tampered with .
longer working hours " poison for growth " germany ’ s powerful trade unions have also naturally reacted angrily to the minister ’ s suggestion that germans should work longer hours .
klaus zwickel , head of the ig metall engineering union , said longer working hours were actually " poison for growth " and a surefire recipe for more unemployment .
clement ’ s comments about cutting down holidays are a particular anathema to the unions at a time when ig metall is striking in eastern germany to demand a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
some economic experts are also doubtful whether reducing the number of public holidays in germany could solve its economic problems .
gustav horn , economist at the berlin-based diw institute , told the associated press news agency that any benefits were likely to be “ small " and that the economy would have to be running at full steam to reap extra growth from longer work hours .

former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing will formally hand over a draft constitution to eu leaders on friday . over the last 16 months , 105 delegates to a constitution convention headed by giscard have hammered out details of a document that will hopefully prepare the eu as it enlarges to 25 countries next year .
while the majority of the most controversial issues have been laid to rest , a few eu governments are expected to do some final tinkering at the greek summit .
europe 's leaders are also expected to haggle over how best to handle immigration and asylum issues on a eu-wide basis , discussing as well the long-overdue reform of the common agricultural policy . the future leadership of the european central bank is also on tap , with france almost certain to nominate bank of france govenor jean-claude trichet to succeed ecb presdent wim duisenberg . dw-world has pulled together recent articles relevant to the summit . dw-world.de european central bank heir apparent cleared of fraud changes bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2003 germans reject sweeping immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a popular destination for immigrants , but the country is still debating whether it wants its doors to be open or closed to foreigners .
germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .
britain has already said it will immediately . germany is unlikely to be making such concessions , although the country 's politicians - from the mainstream left to the mainstream right - have recognized that they can no longer shut their eyes to the issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .

topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .

turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations . in a latest bout of eu-inspired reforms , turkey ’ s parliament on thursday passed a series of human rights reforms aimed to help ankara improve its position in membership talks with brussels in 2004 .
the reforms , disputed by turkey ’ s powerful military , boost broadcasting rights in the kurdish language for its kurdish minority and abolish further laws restricting freedom of thought and expression .
the reform package also scratches so-called anti-separatist laws that allow the state to suppress non-violent protest against the government and to imprison and prosecute human rights activists and political dissidents .
" this package is one of the most important steps turkey has taken on its way to a more contemporary society , " justice minister cemil ciecek told parliament after the vote .
eu accession a delicate issue though the latest reforms are intended to reassure eu officials that ankara is on the right track , the country 's accession to the eu remains a complicated issue .
while the eu exerts pressure on the nation ’ s leaders to meet european political criteria before it can join the bloc , opponents of turkish eu membership such as france argue that turkey with its population of 70 million is too big and too " culturally different " and doubt whether the eu can accommodate an overwhelmingly muslim country .
however , the " culturally different " label notwithstanding , in recent years turkey has made significant strides on europe ’ s cultural scene with its success in music , sports and art .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin celebrate their team 's victory against senegal at the world cup quarterfinal match in japan , june 22 , 2002 .
turkish soccer scores big in may 2000 , turkey made sports history when galatasaray istanbul won the football uefa cup final in copenhagen by trouncing british club arsenal and thus becoming the first turkish club to win a european soccer championship .
an editorial in the english-language turkish daily news at the time said the victory would show europe a new facet of turkey .
" we are seen as a country where human rights are trampled upon , freedom of thought does not exist , torture is practiced on a wide-scale basis .
now , for the first time europe is meeting with a new aspect of turkey , " it said .
last year , the turkish national football team , a relative outsider , came in an unexpected third at the football world cup held in south korea and japan .
and last august , turkish sportsmen walked off with a raft of gold medals at the european stars weightlifting championship in france .
" she conquered europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss world 2002 azra akin from turkey waves to the crowd after winning the event in london saturday dec .
7 , 2002 beyond the sports field , turkey came in tops at an international beauty pageant in december last year , when miss turkey , 22-year-old azra akin -lrb- photo -rrb- claimed the miss world title .
the unexpected turkish winning streak continued this year when turkish director nuri bilge ceylan won the runner-up grand prix prize at the prestigious cannes film festival for his film uzak .
topping the list of impressive turkish triumphs in europe was last month ’ s win at the popular eurovision song contest in latvia when singing sensation sertab erener elbowed out her european counterparts .
given a national hero ’ s welcome back home in turkey , erener ’ s win was celebrated for days with people racing around in their cars and hooting on the streets of istanbul and ankara .
the country ’ s media and politicians hinted at possible political implications tied to the victory with the leading daily milliyet printing a front page article headlined " she conquered europe " .
a turkish parliamentarian , kursat tuzmen , told the anatolia news agency at the time he felt that eurovision success could aid turkey ’ s entry into the european union .
" this is a milestone in creating an atmosphere for entry in the eu like we deserve , " he boasted .
cultural life within turkey still restricted but while there is little doubt that turkey ’ s victories in europe are fueling the country ’ s enthusiasm for the eu , the situation within the largely muslim nation remains precarious for artists and cultural minorities .
caught between the powerful influence of the country ’ s military generals , who still dictate public life and strive to preserve the country ’ s secular credentials , and the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , which is rooted in a banned islamic movement , turkey still sees controversies over the role of women in public life , the wearing of headscarves and the censorship of film and literature that allegedly nurture separatist inclinations .
last year the turkish government banned the showing of handan ipekci ’ s big man , small love , which dealt with turkey ’ s relations with its 12-million strong kurdish community .
ipecki , the film ’ s director , said the film " underlines the fact that people can live together in this land despite all ethnic differences " and condemned the banning as a " prohibitive attitude against art . "
while turkey struggles for eu approval , some politicians like german chancellor gerhard schröder suggest turkey can only fully embrace western values if it ’ s given a chance .
" we must strengthen the pro-western forces in turkey , " he said last year .
" and that can only happen if they are being given a perspective .
that perspective is called europe .

germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them . while the european union has been discussing eu immigration and asylum policies at the thessaloniki summit in greece this week , germany has been equally occupied with the same controversial issues at home . on friday , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected a bill that would have been the country 's first law on immigration . " it 's not about hindering immigration , but about limiting immigration .
the law does n't allow for that and that 's why it 's not acceptable , " premier peter müller of saarland explained after the vote . the legislation , formulated by interior minister otto schily on the basis of recommendations from a commission of experts , was intended to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . but the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , who hold a majority in the bundesrat , refused to approve the bill , complaining schily had made no changes since germany 's constitutional court had ruled that , due to a point of procedure , the legislation had to again be put before the bundesrat for ratification .
the union parties have made no less than 128 proposals for change to the bill , which will now be sent to a parliamentary working group that will have to hammer out an acceptable compromise . both sides - the conservative parties and the governing social democratic and green parties - have expressed optimism that a solution will be found . a country without a policy immigrants could be an answer to germany 's problems .
the country suffers from the same phenomenon that most of the rest of western europe is faced with : a rapidly aging population and falling birthrates and a lack of skilled workers in some industries .
the upshot is that germany 's overstretched pension and welfare system may not be able to shoulder the burden in the future .
immigrants could potentially fill the gap that demographers predict . until now germany has blundered along without a durable immigration policy , despite the fact that it is faced with numerous challenges to regulate and accommodate immigrants .
the country is home to a huge population of southern europeans - especially turks - who were recruited in the 1950s and ' 60s to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
many stayed on and had children here .
at the same time , germany is also one of the most-popular destinations in europe for asylum seekers . there have been attempts in the past to regulate the influx of immigrants but in a piecemeal-like fashion . in an attempt to address the dearth of it specialists in the country , the government launched the so-called " green card " program to make it easier for employers to hire skilled foreigners in 2000 . germany managed to cut down on asylum-seekers in 1993 by declaring that if they traveled through a safe third country to get to germany they would have to apply for asylum in the first country they entered .
since germany is only surrounded by such " safe " countries , applications went down by 75 percent .
conservative politicians now fear though that harmonization of asylum practices in the eu could dash the current system . a sticking point immigration has also been a frequent sticking point between germany and other european union members .
germany makes up most of the eu 's eastern border .
but when the 15 member union started planning to admit germany 's neighbors into the eu , the country balked at the thought of being flooded by central and eastern europeans who might exacerbate the problems of an already strapped job market , where around 4.5 million people are unemployed . germany insisted on provisions to restrict the new eu citizens from enjoying the right to work anywhere in the union once they become members in 2004 .
in the end , the candidate countries agreed on an interim solution that allows their citizens the freedom to work throughout the union five to seven years after the countries become members .
current eu members have the right to open up their job markets to the newcomers as soon as they join .

the winemakers ' federation of australia -lrb- wfa -rrb- attributed the decline to " drought conditions across most regions and cool weather during initial bud formation " .
the total harvest was 1.36 million tonnes , down 10 % from the 2002 season .
white grape production fell 16 % to 558,000 tonnes while red grape output was 5 % lower at 802,000 tonnes .
" with only limited plantings of white grapes in recent years , the seasonal conditions were always going to impact most heavily on whites , " said wfa policy director stephen strachan .
' above average to excellent ' in its annual vintage report , the wfa said the smaller harvest would help reduce oversupply problems , particularly for red grapes .
" with the dramatic increase in winegrape plantings until 1999 , the 2002 and 2003 vintages were always going to challenge the industry 's capacity to grow markets quickly enough to sell the finished product as profitable , branded wine , " said mr strachan .
the report said the quality of the 2003 vintage would be " above average to excellent " because the dry conditions had helped the crop remain " generally disease-free " .
production of the shiraz red grape fell only 2 % - at 320,000 tonnes , shiraz now represents almost a quarter of australia 's total winegrape harvest .
production of pinot noir , the red grape traditionally associated with france 's burgundy region , bucked the trend , rising 34 % to 29,000 tonnes .

" with only limited plantings of white grapes in recent years , the seasonal conditions were always going to impact most heavily on whites , " said wfa policy director stephen strachan .
' above average to excellent ' in its annual vintage report , the wfa said the smaller harvest would help reduce oversupply problems , particularly for red grapes .
" with the dramatic increase in winegrape plantings until 1999 , the 2002 and 2003 vintages were always going to challenge the industry 's capacity to grow markets quickly enough to sell the finished product as profitable , branded wine , " said mr strachan .
the report said the quality of the 2003 vintage would be " above average to excellent " because the dry conditions had helped the crop remain " generally disease-free " .
production of the shiraz red grape fell only 2 % - at 320,000 tonnes , shiraz now represents almost a quarter of australia 's total winegrape harvest .
production of pinot noir , the red grape traditionally associated with france 's burgundy region , bucked the trend , rising 34 % to 29,000 tonnes .

world memory champion andi bell hopes to complete the challenge in five hours , after which he will be tested on the positions of individual cards .
the event is on at the british museum in london , to coincide with its 250th anniversary and an exhibition on memory .
mr bell told the bbc the techniques he uses can be mastered by anybody - even people who often have trouble remembering their own phone number .
confident to make sure there is no cheating involved in mr bell 's challenge , the cards were randomly shuffled by professional croupiers in front of witnesses .
you have got to think of the things you want to remember against a mental backdrop of places that you know .
andi bell mr bell said he was confident that he would be successful .
he said : " as far as i know , no one else has ever memorised 100 decks of cards in five hours .
" i will be asked 100 questions - one about each deck of cards - and i 'm sure there will be very few i ca n't answer .
hopefully i will get all 100 right . "
animals and objects describing the key to his extraordinary memory , mr bell said : " you have got to think of the things you want to remember against a mental backdrop of places that you know . "
he imagines the cards as animals and colourful objects and remembers them as being in different locations .
" to recall i just think back to those places , hopefully seeing the images still there , and turn them back into the cards . "
it is a technique which he has previously used to successfully memorise 23 decks of cards in one hour .
god given ?
mr bell has also performed the feat of memorising a 333 digit number spoken at a rate of a digit every two seconds .
but he denied that his talent was " god given " and said anybody could benefit from his techniques .
mr bell suggested that somebody wanting to learn history could imagine a different room in a house for every century and store events accordingly .
" you can apply it to anything , you can apply it to learning , " he said .

world memory champion andi bell hopes to complete the challenge in five hours , after which he will be tested on the positions of individual cards .
the event is on at the british museum in london , to coincide with its 250th anniversary and an exhibition on memory .
mr bell told the bbc the techniques he uses can be mastered by anybody - even people who often have trouble remembering their own phone number .
confident to make sure there is no cheating involved in mr bell 's challenge , the cards were randomly shuffled by professional croupiers in front of witnesses .
you have got to think of the things you want to remember against a mental backdrop of places that you know .
andi bell mr bell said he was confident that he would be successful .
he said : " as far as i know , no one else has ever memorised 100 decks of cards in five hours .
" i will be asked 100 questions - one about each deck of cards - and i 'm sure there will be very few i ca n't answer .

" to recall i just think back to those places , hopefully seeing the images still there , and turn them back into the cards . "
it is a technique which he has previously used to successfully memorise 23 decks of cards in one hour .

mr bell has also performed the feat of memorising a 333 digit number spoken at a rate of a digit every two seconds .

mr bell suggested that somebody wanting to learn history could imagine a different room in a house for every century and store events accordingly .
" you can apply it to anything , you can apply it to learning , " he said .

increasing numbers of drivers and cyclists are failing to stop when the lights turn red , putting their own lives and those of other road users in danger .
the rac foundation says the problem is now so bad that police should switch resources away from speed cameras and into catching people who run red lights .
breakfast talked to sue nicholson of the rac foundation about why drivers feel it 's worth taking the risk. click here to watch our interview in full with sue nicholson the rac foundation conducted research in london and glasgow .
they discovered that around one in ten car drivers failed to obey a red light .
a taxi driver drove through a red light and i became a wheelchair user !
i ca n't believe that more traffic cameras are not used on lights to deter motorists from playing russian roulette .
sarah morris click here to read more of your e-mails on our your say page the figures were even worse for bus drivers : around one in five rumbled through a red .
and one in two of all london cyclists ignored red lights , even though they are probably the most vulnerable of all road users .
those in glasgow were rather better behaved : only one in four failed to stop .
the rac says the survey shows what happens when drivers get frustrated by traffic jams : " growing congestion is frustrating for all road users .
it makes them late , " says the rac foundation 's kevin delaney .
" this may increase the temptation to ignore red traffic lights , but it is dangerous and a foolish way to beat the clock .
" however , it seems that an increasing number of drivers and cyclists are putting their safety and that of other road users , especially pedestrians , in jeopardy by risking it at traffic lights .

campaigners fighting the new towns say it raises the question of whether they are needed at all .
the plans are for 3,500 new dwellings at sherford , on the outskirts of plymouth in the south hams , and 2,900 houses at broadclyst , near exeter .
the schemes have been bitterly opposed by people in nearby villages , but the public inquiry has now been told by developers they may have better locations to build on .
near plymouth that includes proposals for sites in lee mill , woolwell , boringdon and newnham .
in exeter , away from the original broadclyst site , developers are suggesting pinhoe instead .
the inquiry has now been deferred until the end of next month to fully examine the new areas .
planners in the south hams also want to see proper scrutiny of other options .
they argue that plymouth itself could take many more new homes on brownfield sites , in line with government guidance .
they welcomed any review of the new town plans .
lee bray , of south hams district council , said : " we really do believe it is significant .
" we hope that , by taking this little bit of extra time at this point in the process , they will be able to resolve some of those thorny issues quite clearly and give us a clear way forward for the next 10 or 12 years . "
local campaigners have fought both new town plans from the outset .
in the sherford valley they argue the £ 1bn it would cost to build there should go to plymouth instead which desperately needs the investment .
with the backing of local planners and the inquiry being deferred , they are now more hopeful that things may not be set in stone .
paddy ryder , from south hams against rural destruction , said : " south hams now appear to be appreciating the problems of going the way they were trying to go .
" one hopes their slight change in tack will now become a total change in course and they 'll get back onto a line to become what people in the south hams want - opposed to what somebody else outside the south hams wants . "
the inquiry into the new homes is due to restart on 21 july .

gruffudd , from cardiff and who used to compete in eisteddfod competitions , said he was delighted to be inducted .
gorsedd of the bards created in 1792 as celebration of welsh and celtic heritage gorsedd is welsh for " high seat " rituals look back to era when celtic druids - religious professionals - led society currently 1,300 members he added : " i am very grateful and appreciative of the high honour that the gorsedd of the bards has bestowed upon me .
" to be honoured in such a way is very humbling .
" competing in eisteddfodau in wales , including the national eisteddfod , gave me great confidence which has stood me in good stead in my career .
" i am very proud to be welsh and have endeavoured to carry the culture and traditions of wales to wherever i have been fortunate enough to work .
" i fervently hope that any success i and my fellow actors from wales may achieve in the future will help to increase awareness , in the rest of the world , of wales ' contribution to european culture . "
also honoured at the event will be former plaid cymru am phil williams and bbc presenter sulwyn thomas .
mr williams will be awarded the title posthumously after he collapsed at a cardiff massage parlour and died , earlier this month .
his funeral is taking place in aberystwyth on friday .
contribution the gorsedd first gathered at primrose hill , london , in 1792 , and made its first eisteddfod appearance at carmarthen in 1819 , standing around a circle of stones .
today the circle numbers poets , writers , musicians , artists , sportsmen and women , and others who have made a contribution to welsh culture .
former welsh secretary ron davies , cricketer robert croft , opera singer bryn terfel and the queen are all members of the group .
last year , archbishop of canterbury-elect rowan williams was inducted to the gorsedd of the bards despite claims from some national newspapers that the ceremony had pagan connotations .

it came from peter hain , who 's the leader of the house of commons - and it 's the first time that any of tony blair 's cabinet has backed a rise in income tax .
his comments have already been brushed aside by the treasury , which says it 's up to the chancellor to decide tax levels .
but they do represent a return to some of the values of old labour .
this morning , breakfast tried to get to the bottom of the gathering row over his remarks we caught up with peter hain , on the phone from his constituency in south wales. click here to watch our interview in full with peter hain and , we asked what you think click here to go straight to our your comments page further details from bbc news online in a speech on today , peter hain is expected to say that too many people on average incomes - including teachers and police officers - now fall into the 40 % tax band .
he will become the first minister to propose the redistribution of money through the introduction of a higher top rate of tax , the mirror reports .
the money raised could also be used to increase the threshold at which those on low incomes start to pay tax , the paper says .
mr hain is expected to say : " how can we ensure that hard-working middle-income families and the low paid get a better deal , except by those at the very top of the pay scale contributing more ? "
peter hain is the first minister to call for such a tax shake-up until now ministers had avoided suggestions of increased taxes , following tony blair 's 1997 election pledge of " no rise in income tax rates " .
but rising incomes have gradually pushed more and more people into the 40 % tax band .
at present , the basic rate of tax is 22 % on earnings up to £ 35,115 .
above this level the 40 % rate of tax comes in .
one option could be to introduce a 50 % rate on earnings over £ 50,000 , and 60 % for income over £ 100,000 .
the 22 % basic rate ceiling could then be lifted to £ 50,000 , the daily mirror said .
for somebody on £ 50,000 a year the change would mean an extra £ 2,860 a year , or £ 51 a week .

as a south african ex-pat anti-apartheid activist , he was the leader of a campaign of direct action aimed at disrupting the all-white south african rugby team 's tour of the uk .
he became chairman of the young liberals in 1971 and continued to be a prominent activist throughout the 1970s .
the south african security services even attempted to have him framed for a bank robbery in 1975 , but he was acquitted of all charges .
he joined the labour party in 1977 and spent his career as a trade union official until entering the commons at a 1991 by-election .
his left-wing credentials were established by his prominence within the tribune group and repeatedly underscored by his performance in the commons .
foreign office job nonetheless , he found a place on the new labour frontbench and became a junior welsh office minister in 1997 , where he found himself responsible for managing alun michael 's campaign for the leadership of welsh labour .
mr hain was moved to the foreign office as minister for africa , where he enjoyed a much higher profile than is normal for that role with interventions over zimbabwe .
after a short stint at the department of trade and industry as energy minister , he returned to the fco after the 2001 election as minister for europe .
mr hain used to be known as one of the more eurosceptic labour mps but soon became one of the government 's most enthusiastic promoters of the prospect of british entry into the european single currency .
he is seen as trusted by mr blair to sometimes say things the prime minister can not - and his tax proposals will be seen in that light .
it is inconceivable that his speech was not approved by mr blair .
in the debate over the euro , mr hain has been vocal in backing the currency - and was again seen as reflecting the views of downing street .
he replaced paul murphy as secretary of state for wales in october 2002 - although since the post-devolution role is not the most demanding in the cabinet , he also retained his place on the convention on the future of europe .
in that role he played a key part negotiating on behalf of the uk as delegates hammered out proposals for the way the eu will work after it welcomes 10 new countries .
mr hain tied the knot for the second time in june 2003 , marrying award-winning businesswoman elizabeth haywood , 47 .
he did that having just moved up another rung in the cabinet , taking over from john reid as leader of the house of commons .
as part of the reshuffle , he also retained the role of welsh secretary following tony blair 's controversial constitutional shake-up .
mr hain was born in nairobi and brought up in south africa .
he was educated at pretoria boys high school , the university of london and sussex university .
