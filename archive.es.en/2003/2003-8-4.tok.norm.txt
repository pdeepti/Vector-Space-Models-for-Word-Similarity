the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- is threatening the first national postal strike in seven years .
the royal mail says the pay offer is a 14.5 % increase , but the union says that is a " dishonest " claim .
about 160,000 members of the cwu will vote over the next few weeks on whether to stage a series of walk-outs .
the dispute centres on this year 's wage offer , which the cwu says has more " strings " than a philharmonic orchestra .
' job cuts ' the union says the royal mail was not being straight with workers when it said the pay deal was worth 14.5 % over 18 months .
if employees vote for strike action , it will be the consumers that lose out peter carr , postwatch it says the only definite money on offer was 3 % from october and a further 1.5 % next april .
the union also said it was being asked to agree to 30,000 job cuts , which it said would " destroy " postal service .
cwu deputy general secretary dave ward said : " the royal mail is being dishonest by claiming they are offering 14.5 % .
" if that was the case , the union would be biting their hand off . "
a spokesman for the royal mail said the offer was worth 14.5 % on pensionable pay and was linked to " simple " productivity changes .
postwatch - the watchdog for the postal service - added that the offer included a move from a six day week to five days .
chairman peter carr told bbc news 24 : " if employees vote for strike action , it will be the consumers that lose out . "
productivity royal mail said the latest offer contained fewer conditions than one recommended for acceptance earlier in the year by the cwu leadership .
the royal mail was still losing around £ 750,000 a day , the spokesman added , and could only afford the pay offer if it improved productivity and avoided strikes .
the union is being threatened with legal action by the royal mail over a leaflet produced by its london branch which claimed chairman allan leighton had awarded himself a " big , fat pay check and £ 3m bonus " .
mr leighton earns around £ 180,000 in pay and bonuses .
mail train meanwhile business post , an independent parcels delivery firm , has confirmed it is in talks to save some mail train services , which will shortly be axed by the royal mail .

the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- is threatening the first national postal strike in seven years .
the royal mail says the pay offer is a 14.5 % increase , but the union says that is a " dishonest " claim .
about 160,000 members of the cwu will vote over the next few weeks on whether to stage a series of walk-outs .
the dispute centres on this year 's wage offer , which the cwu says has more " strings " than a philharmonic orchestra .
' job cuts ' the union says the royal mail was not being straight with workers when it said the pay deal was worth 14.5 % over 18 months .
if employees vote for strike action , it will be the consumers that lose out peter carr , postwatch it says the only definite money on offer was 3 % from october and a further 1.5 % next april .
the union also said it was being asked to agree to 30,000 job cuts , which it said would " destroy " postal service .
cwu deputy general secretary dave ward said : " the royal mail is being dishonest by claiming they are offering 14.5 % .
" if that was the case , the union would be biting their hand off . "
a spokesman for the royal mail said the offer was worth 14.5 % on pensionable pay and was linked to " simple " productivity changes .
postwatch - the watchdog for the postal service - added that the offer included a move from a six day week to five days .
chairman peter carr told bbc news 24 : " if employees vote for strike action , it will be the consumers that lose out . "
productivity royal mail said the latest offer contained fewer conditions than one recommended for acceptance earlier in the year by the cwu leadership .
the royal mail was still losing around £ 750,000 a day , the spokesman added , and could only afford the pay offer if it improved productivity and avoided strikes .
the union is being threatened with legal action by the royal mail over a leaflet produced by its london branch which claimed chairman allan leighton had awarded himself a " big , fat pay check and £ 3m bonus " .
mr leighton earns around £ 180,000 in pay and bonuses .
mail train meanwhile business post , an independent parcels delivery firm , has confirmed it is in talks to save some mail train services , which will shortly be axed by the royal mail .
the firm could safeguard some of the 517 jobs , under threat following the royal mail 's decision to switch from rail to road transport .
business post said it was in preliminary discussions with rail freight operator ews about setting up a limited high speed mail service between london and scotland .

key features of the new centre include a glass roof , a flagship department store and new leisure facilities .
up to a third of existing shops will be knocked down , with flats and a major new car park expected to take their place .
permission for the renovations has already been granted by bristol city council and if work starts next summer , it could be finished in 2007 .
a scale model of the proposed development is on public view for two weeks from monday at the galleries .

carmarthenshire nhs trust says its reviewing the service at prince philip hospital in llanelli .

mr evans feared the long-term aim would be to downgrade it to a cottage hospital .

" and we 've stood still and in fact gone backwards in many services .
there are warnings by staff that lives could be at risk " very often in this part of wales all the hospitals are full to acute admissions and there 's no one unit that can cope with all the acute emergencies .

it recently advertised in the medical press throughout the uk , but failed to receive one suitable application .
a trust spokesperson said : " the safe provision of accident and emergency services remains our paramount consideration and the continuing difficulties in the recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of medical staff has raised concerns regarding safety .

among the shiniest jewels in the british comedy crown are the talents of the monty python team .
so , it is something of a surprise that a group of parisians are daring to bring monty python to the uk stage - and entirely in french .
the production will have its uk debut at this year 's edinburgh fringe festival , after a highly successful run in the french capital .
it features some of the most iconic sketches from the monty python show , such as the ministry of silly walks .
more essentially , the 55-minute production has the blessing of original pythons terry gilliam and terry jones .
the show was the idea of french impresario rémy renoux and , for the benefit of the fringe audience , he has provided english subtitles displayed on a big screen . "
they have created a system of humour that translates into every language " rémy renoux , theatre producer but , despite this concession , renoux is cautious about how his production will be received by the uk monty python fans .
" it is completely unknown territory how the british are going to react , " said renoux .
" and it is especially impertinent that we are giving such a show its uk première both with the backing of the original pythons and in scotland , where the relationship with france has long been very good . "
' proud ' renoux approached gilliam and jones with his idea two years ago and , after some hesitation , they agreed to allow the show to go ahead .
" they realised we were not trying to copy them but adapting their work , " renoux explained .
" and when they finally saw the outcome they were at once charmed and surprised . "
gilliam has seen the show three times , jones once and michael palin has also been along .
other celebrated python ingredients in the show include the lumberjack song and the sperm song .
it also takes elements from the python films .
and for the first time , the troupe will be doing their version of the dead parrot sketch .
" i am very proud , " renoux added .
renoux felt it was important to bring balance and inclusivity to his production .
he got permission to include a woman and a black actor - who will not be in edinburgh - in a change to the original all-white , all-male permanent line-up .
" terry gilliam and terry jones said that if they were remaking python today they would have a balanced cast and one that represented the universality of monty python , " renoux said .
original and best his show has been a big hit with french audiences since it opened in paris in october 2002 .
and , it is precisely that universality - contained in the monty python comedy - that makes it a favourite the world over , renoux commented .
" they have created a system of humour that translates into every language .
" some of the sketches are very british but there is a lot of variety so you always find those which correspond to a particular culture . "
the french particularly enjoy sketches with a lot of drama , such as argument scenes , said renoux .
his own particular favourite is that of the policemen with silly voices .
monty python is still a regular fixture on french tv where the series and films are often repeated .
and , renoux says , french comedy shows just can not compare .
" there are those who try to act like monty python .
but the originals were the first to use a form of uncontrolled freedom that has since been used in each country and culture .
the monty python phenomenon was unique . "
monty python 's flying circus will run for nine performances at edinburgh 's pleasance one from 2 august .

among the shiniest jewels in the british comedy crown are the talents of the monty python team .
the troupe " adapt " not " copy " so , it is something of a surprise that a group of parisians are daring to bring monty python to the uk stage - and entirely in french .
the production will have its uk debut at this year 's edinburgh fringe festival , after a highly successful run in the french capital .
it features some of the most iconic sketches from the monty python show , such as the ministry of silly walks .
more essentially , the 55-minute production has the blessing of original pythons terry gilliam and terry jones .
the show was the idea of french impresario rémy renoux and , for the benefit of the fringe audience , he has provided english subtitles displayed on a big screen .
they have created a system of humour that translates into every language rémy renoux , theatre producer but , despite this concession , renoux is cautious about how his production will be received by the uk monty python fans .
" it is completely unknown territory how the british are going to react , " said renoux .
" and it is especially impertinent that we are giving such a show its uk première both with the backing of the original pythons and in scotland , where the relationship with france has long been very good . "
' proud ' renoux approached gilliam and jones with his idea two years ago and , after some hesitation , they agreed to allow the show to go ahead .
" they realised we were not trying to copy them but adapting their work , " renoux explained .
" and when they finally saw the outcome they were at once charmed and surprised . "
original pythons gilliam -lrb- top left -rrb- and jones -lrb- bottom left -rrb- were happy with the show gilliam has seen the show three times , jones once and michael palin has also been along .
other celebrated python ingredients in the show include the lumberjack song and the sperm song .
it also takes elements from the python films .
and for the first time , the troupe will be doing their version of the dead parrot sketch .
" i am very proud , " renoux added .
renoux felt it was important to bring balance and inclusivity to his production .
he got permission to include a woman and a black actor - who will not be in edinburgh - in a change to the original all-white , all-male permanent line-up .
" terry gilliam and terry jones said that if they were remaking python today they would have a balanced cast and one that represented the universality of monty python , " renoux said .
original and best his show has been a big hit with french audiences since it opened in paris in october 2002 .
and , it is precisely that universality - contained in the monty python comedy - that makes it a favourite the world over , renoux commented .
" they have created a system of humour that translates into every language .
" some of the sketches are very british but there is a lot of variety so you always find those which correspond to a particular culture . "
the french particularly enjoy sketches with a lot of drama , such as argument scenes , said renoux .
his own particular favourite is that of the policemen with silly voices .
monty python is still a regular fixture on french tv where the series and films are often repeated .
and , renoux says , french comedy shows just can not compare .
" there are those who try to act like monty python .
but the originals were the first to use a form of uncontrolled freedom that has since been used in each country and culture .
the monty python phenomenon was unique . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- sense of the city : st petersburg home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages last updated : monday , 4 august , 2003 , 06:33 gmt 07:33 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version sense of the city : st petersburg the bbc is asking novelists who have a profound understanding of the city they live in to reflect on the fiction it has produced and the various works of literature set there .
people often talk about petersburg being a museum the daughter of russian emigres , ingrid bengis grew up in the us but moved to st petersburg in 1991 .
she is the author of metro stop dostoevsky , which offers a contemporary view of the city from the perspective of an " outsider " .
my mother was born in odessa .
my father was born in vilnius .
my mother left in 1921 .
but i did n't come to petersburg until 1985 , and i came singing in an amateur opera company , and i 've been here ever since .
of course i had no idea what i was in for , or had no idea what russia was in for - nobody did .
i just happened to be here during all of this very difficult period in russian life , and i wrote about it .
since the title is metro stop dostoevsky , one of the very important elements in the book is that the shadow of dostoevsky is always here and always hovering .
i love dostoevsky and when i first came here it was a great surprise to me to realise that the events that take place in dostoevsky 's novels take place on these streets , in these doorways , these apartments .
the streets are old , the courtyards are old , so that world physically still exists here .
it 's not as if it has gotten fancied up .
it 's not a museum .
people often talk about petersburg being a museum , but the world of dostoevsky is certainly not a museum here .
to me it 's still very alive .
i feel that somehow the city corresponds to the reality of life , to the real complexity of life , to the whole spectrum of emotions that you can feel .
it 's terrible and it 's beautiful .
it 's exciting and it 's boring .
it 's trashy and it 's elegant .
and it 's everything .
everything that has affected me at least - all the literature connected with st petersburg - has a somewhat hallucinatory quality .
living here is like an itch the sense of something glorious but something not stable on its feet .
i think the fact that the city is built on a swamp really has an effect on that .
the sense that the whole city could disappear in a second .
there is also that sense of discordant elements constantly clashing against each other , of this society that is kind of whirling around at tremendous speed .
so i think a major theme of this city , if you 're going to choose only one , would have to do with destiny , a sense of destiny .
and what is that destiny - trying to define that destiny , and running from that destiny , trying to escape from it and then being caught by it again .
it 's a city with a very , very strong sense of destiny and i think the literature reflects that .
i ca n't imagine someone writing a calm book that had no serious questions in it .
i ca n't imagine someone writing that kind of book here .
living here is like an itch .
there is something troubling you - troubling your sleep , troubling your dreams .
when you 're a writer you 're sort of juggling all these things that fall into your hands and not really knowing quite what to do with them but they 're bothering you all the time .
it 's hard for writers in general right now ... nobody knows what they 're writing about or for whom or why and so you have to give shape to them .
it 's not something that they 're even consciously saying : " i 'm going to write about this . "
it 's just something you ca n't get rid of .
new literature that 's being produced now - it 's almost as if there is this gap and history does n't exist at all .
and also right now there is this tremendous attraction , which i find a little odd , to the world of the 19th century - this aristocratic world as if everybody was living that way - and i think it 's a rather romanticised picture of those times .
but as far as writers are concerned i think it 's a very confusing time .
i think it 's hard for writers in general right now , because there is this sense of having lost a sense of purpose , and that nobody knows what they 're writing about or for whom or why .
i think that in some strange way that censorship provided something to fight against , and so each word was precious .
and i think the preciousness of the word is what 's being lost here .
sense of the city can be heard on the bbc world service programme the world today until friday 8 august , and includes orhan pamuk talking about istanbul , and romesh gunesekera on colombo .

it 's not something that they 're even consciously saying : " i 'm going to write about this . "
it 's just something you ca n't get rid of .
new literature that 's being produced now - it 's almost as if there is this gap and history does n't exist at all .
and also right now there is this tremendous attraction , which i find a little odd , to the world of the 19th century - this aristocratic world as if everybody was living that way - and i think it 's a rather romanticised picture of those times .
but as far as writers are concerned i think it 's a very confusing time .
i think it 's hard for writers in general right now , because there is this sense of having lost a sense of purpose , and that nobody knows what they 're writing about or for whom or why .
i think that in some strange way that censorship provided something to fight against , and so each word was precious .

people often talk about petersburg being a museum the daughter of russian emigres , ingrid bengis grew up in the us but moved to st petersburg in 1991 .
she is the author of metro stop dostoevsky , which offers a contemporary view of the city from the perspective of an " outsider " .
my mother was born in odessa .
my father was born in vilnius .
my mother left in 1921 .
but i did n't come to petersburg until 1985 , and i came singing in an amateur opera company , and i 've been here ever since .
of course i had no idea what i was in for , or had no idea what russia was in for - nobody did .
i just happened to be here during all of this very difficult period in russian life , and i wrote about it .
since the title is metro stop dostoevsky , one of the very important elements in the book is that the shadow of dostoevsky is always here and always hovering .
i love dostoevsky and when i first came here it was a great surprise to me to realise that the events that take place in dostoevsky 's novels take place on these streets , in these doorways , these apartments .
the streets are old , the courtyards are old , so that world physically still exists here .
it 's not as if it has gotten fancied up .
it 's not a museum .
people often talk about petersburg being a museum , but the world of dostoevsky is certainly not a museum here .
to me it 's still very alive .
i feel that somehow the city corresponds to the reality of life , to the real complexity of life , to the whole spectrum of emotions that you can feel .
it 's terrible and it 's beautiful .
it 's exciting and it 's boring .
it 's trashy and it 's elegant .
and it 's everything .
everything that has affected me at least - all the literature connected with st petersburg - has a somewhat hallucinatory quality .
living here is like an itch the sense of something glorious but something not stable on its feet .
i think the fact that the city is built on a swamp really has an effect on that .
the sense that the whole city could disappear in a second .
there is also that sense of discordant elements constantly clashing against each other , of this society that is kind of whirling around at tremendous speed .
so i think a major theme of this city , if you 're going to choose only one , would have to do with destiny , a sense of destiny .
and what is that destiny - trying to define that destiny , and running from that destiny , trying to escape from it and then being caught by it again .
it 's a city with a very , very strong sense of destiny and i think the literature reflects that .
i ca n't imagine someone writing a calm book that had no serious questions in it .
i ca n't imagine someone writing that kind of book here .
living here is like an itch .
there is something troubling you - troubling your sleep , troubling your dreams .
when you 're a writer you 're sort of juggling all these things that fall into your hands and not really knowing quite what to do with them but they 're bothering you all the time .
it 's hard for writers in general right now ... nobody knows what they 're writing about or for whom or why and so you have to give shape to them .
it 's not something that they 're even consciously saying : " i 'm going to write about this . "
it 's just something you ca n't get rid of .
