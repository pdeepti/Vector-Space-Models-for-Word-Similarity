the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .
state secretary for culture christina weiss has said an international architectural competition for the palace is already being prepared . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .

the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2003 roadwork ahead for the european union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased traffic could slow europe 's highways to a crawl .
six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .
europe may enlarge in 2004 , but it could take a few more years to achieve the envisioned “ trans-europe network . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement : what comes next ?
the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2003 roadwork ahead for the european union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased traffic could slow europe 's highways to a crawl .
six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .
europe may enlarge in 2004 , but it could take a few more years to achieve the envisioned “ trans-europe network . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement : what comes next ?
the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .

at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .

the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2003 roadwork ahead for the european union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased traffic could slow europe 's highways to a crawl .
six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .

it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .

the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .

after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .
state secretary for culture christina weiss has said an international architectural competition for the palace is already being prepared . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .

federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .

she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .
state secretary for culture christina weiss has said an international architectural competition for the palace is already being prepared . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .
at a press conference last friday , trichet said the stability and growth pact provided “ an appropriate framework ” for ensuring fiscal discipline .
he added that it “ must not be placed in doubt . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu delays action on french budget deficit france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .

apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .
state secretary for culture christina weiss has said an international architectural competition for the palace is already being prepared . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .

“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.11.2003 roadwork ahead for the european union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased traffic could slow europe 's highways to a crawl .
six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .
europe may enlarge in 2004 , but it could take a few more years to achieve the envisioned “ trans-europe network . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement : what comes next ?

but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .

“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .

slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .

the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .

the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2003 eu may force germany to trim the deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the deficit will be this big - hans eichel is struggling to get the budget under control .
a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .
at a press conference last friday , trichet said the stability and growth pact provided “ an appropriate framework ” for ensuring fiscal discipline .
he added that it “ must not be placed in doubt . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu delays action on french budget deficit france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .

federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .
europe may enlarge in 2004 , but it could take a few more years to achieve the envisioned “ trans-europe network . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement : what comes next ?

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .

in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .

the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2003 eu may force germany to trim the deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the deficit will be this big - hans eichel is struggling to get the budget under control .
a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .
at a press conference last friday , trichet said the stability and growth pact provided “ an appropriate framework ” for ensuring fiscal discipline .
he added that it “ must not be placed in doubt . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu delays action on french budget deficit france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .
at a press conference last friday , trichet said the stability and growth pact provided “ an appropriate framework ” for ensuring fiscal discipline .
he added that it “ must not be placed in doubt . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu delays action on french budget deficit france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .
and the eu is in danger of experiencing what an official white paper on transport policy released by the eu in 2001 described as , “ apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities . ”
at the current rate , reaching the goals prescribed in maastricht could drag on until 2030 .
in the debate leading up to eu enlargement , it became clear that infrastructure was going to pose a challenge .
along with enlargement would come a significant increase in cross-border transportation , both for trade and leisure purposes .
in fact , experts believe cross border traffic could increase by as much as 200 percent in the next ten years .
that ’ s quite a load for an already over-stressed system .
of the existing eu road network , 7,500 kilometers -lrb- one-tenth -rrb- , are clogged by traffic on any given day .
the situation is only going to get worse if the expert ’ s predictions are correct .
slow progress threatens economic livelihood the european commission recognized the impending crisis , and has been working since the early 1990s to address the problem , attempting to weave a trans-european network consisting of ten so-called “ corridors , ” for example , a 445-kilometer road-rail link between helsinki and kaliningrad via tallinn and warsaw .
it was hoped all of the work would be wrapped up by 2010 .
karel van miert , a former eu commissioner and the director of the eu working group “ trans-european transport network ” -lrb- ten-t -rrb- , was charged with the task of checking over all of the european infrastructure projects currently in progress and those scheduled to begin , reassessing them based on how urgent they are and whether or not they can be financed .
the completion of the “ corridor ” concept , as proposed , for example , would require € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in funds , while brussels only makes € 500 million available every year .
in a report submitted by the working group ten-t in june of 2003 , van miert and his collegues set priorities , stating that an investment of € 500 billion was necessary if the eu was to be fully competitive and efficient .
what ’ s more , the report pointed to key priorities , including a high-speed train eastward and an eastern european combined transport train .
more than projects are on the high priority list , with a revised date of completion now 2020 .
setting priorities and uneven progress given the limited finances , experts tend to part ways when it comes to setting priorities .
tensions persist over whether to invest more in roads versus rail , and it would seem that roads have thus far won out , with the number of kilometers of highways more than tripled from 16,000 to 53,000 kilometers .
uneven progress also remains a problem .
germany , already rife with experience linking east and west following re-unification , hired a consultant , the van-miert group , to help them hold up their end of the bargain .
“ we belong to those who contributed right from the start , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe .
“ and compared to others , german is relatively far along . ”
elsewhere , that has not been the case .
hartmut mehdorn , the head of deutsche bahn , is not happy with the situation .
“ i am mainly critical of the fact that on the other side of the border not enough is being done , ” mehdorn told deutsche welle .
“ it won ’ t get us anywhere if we ’ re the only ones doing something - something has to be done in eastern europe as well . ”
those to the east would say that they are trying , but lack the funds available in western countries and need the support of the european union .
“ of course , we could pay for the improvements ourselves , but that would take much longer , ” said eva kramer , the hungarian transportation minister .
“ it has been a huge help that we have received half of our funding from the european cohesion fund . ”
ambitious plans drawn up ten years ago are now meeting with the reality of changed circumstances .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .

federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .
when east berlin was the capital of the gdr under erich honecker , the building not only housed parliament , governmental offices , restaurants , bars , cafés and a bowling alley , but it was also the venue for communist party events , exhibitions , concerts and theater productions . asbestos-ridden the building was closed to the public in 1990 , when asbestos was discovered in it .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million to remove the cancer-causing fibers .
since the work was completed , the building has only occasionally been open for guided tours and cultural events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern palace shortly before its demoltition in 1950 .
some people believe that " erich 's lamp shop " - dubbed so for the thousands of light fittings it had - should be preserved .
parlamentarian petra pau , one of the two who voted against the building 's demolition , said the decision was a " victory of ideologues . "
she referred to the numerous petitions circulating to save the building where the freely-elected east german parliament voted in favor of uniting with west germany in 1990 . when the budget does finally allow it , the park that replaces " palazzo pretentious " will make way for a partial reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace façade and a modern interior .

when winter begins , germans start indulging in one of their favorite pastimes - playing board games .
germany is the most game-crazy nation in europe , both when it comes to playing games and inventing them . michael bartusch-lenzen scans the cordoned-off area inside the exhibition hall where about 16 adults sit hunched over their tables playing a board game called “ the settlers of catan . ” they ’ re not just playing for fun ; they ’ re all finalists in the 2003 catan world championships , one of the highlights of the annual gaming trade fair in the german city of essen . bartusch-lenzen is the tournament ’ s organizer and himself a huge fan of catan , one of the most successful board games ever produced in germany . “ i started playing catan the year it was published , in 1995 , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .
now i don ’ t play it quite so often , maybe every two weeks . ”
despite the regularity with which he plays catan , bartush-lenzen doesn ’ t consider himself a board game freak .
that title is reserved for people such as the 2002 german national catan champion .
“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .
when “ the settlers of catan ” won the coveted board game award “ spiel des jahres ” or game of the year in 1995 , it sparked a renewed interest in gaming in germany .
but germans have always been crazy about board games .
national passion germany has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . sales reach their peak during the pre-christmas period with a game or two guaranteed to be underneath most german christmas trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alhambra author dirk henn the game most likely to fly off the shelves is the one bearing the current “ spiel des jahres ” sticker . this year , that honour went to a game called “ alhambra , ” published by queen games .
the game ’ s author , dirk henn , who began inventing games as a university student , has been waiting a long time for the recognition he ’ s getting now .
“ i can ’ t count the number of games i ’ ve created , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ about 20 of my games have actually been published , but that ’ s discounting all the attempts that landed in the rubbish bin .
it ’ s a tough profession .
let me put it this way , you shouldn ’ t become a game author if you want to make a lot of money , there are better ways . ” still , henn admits that winning the " spiel des jahres " gives him financial security .
the winning game is guaranteed to sell about 200,000 copies in germany alone . and with growing interest in gaming in other markets , such as asia and the united states , there ’ s a good chance his game could be translated and sold abroad . cultural divides but not every game that ’ s a hit in germany will repeat that success in other markets . gaming is very culture specific , according to mark kaufmann , vice president of days of wonder , a u.s. game publisher with partners in france . “ culturally , people approach games differently , we all have different backgrounds that might make us more or less interested , ” he said .
“ the german gamer likes more abstract games .
they like more strategic types of games , unlike many american players .
americans have less patience than germans in particular and europeans in general , and they like immediacy , so we look for games that are easy to learn . ” there are different theories as to why germans enjoy gaming so much .
some say it has to do with the weather , as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game . others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that ’ s rare in germany ’ s typically formal society .
“ it ’ s definitely the interaction with the opponents , ” said dirk tedes , a gaming fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , one of germany ’ s leading game publishers . “ or maybe it ’ s because most germans aren ’ t very happy people most of the time , ” he added jokingly .
“ it ’ s a sort of vent .
you can exchange stories while playing .
it ’ s fun , and it ’ s addictive . ”
his colleague at ravensburger , heinrich hüntelmann , agrees .
“ if you want to get to know someone , the easiest way is to play a game .
i ’ ve even had a friend say , if you ’ re thinking of getting married , play a game with your future spouse first , and then you ’ ll know if you ’ re really meant for each other . ” deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new " speedminton " craze takes off even the danish royal family is hooked on it : speedminton , a mixture of badminton and squash , is the trend sport of the summer .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .

six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .
the slow progress means an expanded eu could get stuck in a traffic jam . time and money are running out to put the finishing touches on an improved europe-wide transportation network - including roads , rail , ships , and planes .
the project ’ s success remains vital to the creation of an economically viable and a culturally cohesive eu - whose industry enjoys the efficient transport of goods and services and whose citizens enjoy a feeling of interconnection , helping to diminish physical and psychological boundaries .
yet just six months before the official entry of ten new countries into the european union - scheduled to take place on may 1 , 2004 - only one fifth of the work has been completed .

“ in the beginning i played it a lot - between 200 and 300 games a year , nearly a game a day .

“ he plays the game three or four times a day - every day , ” bartusch-lenzen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2003 lights out for erich 's lamp shop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in better days : the palace of the republic the palace of the republic 's days are numbered .
the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .
parliament already decided in 2002 to replace " palazzo pretentious " - one of the building 's disparaging local nicknames - with another palace , the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace that was heavily damaged in world war ii and demolished in 1950 .
but with light in the tunnel only barely visible after three years of economic stagnation , there 's no money in germany 's budget for a project estimated to cost around € 600 million -lrb- roughly $ 700 million -rrb- . instead , the gutted husk of a parliament-cum-entertainment center in downtown berlin will yield to a park until the federal government and the city are in better financial shape . ballast of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now just a shadow of its former self but not everyone 's satisfied with that solution either .
federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .
strieder says the demolition work , which would take up to two years , could begin in 2005 . the palace of the republic was built in 1976 on the exact spot where the hohenzollern palace had been torn down 26 years earlier .

a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact . germany ’ s confrontation with the european commission over the stability and growth pact is escalating .
the commission announced on thursday that it will proceed with the same tough measures it instituted against france earlier this month – both countries are on track to violate the conditions of the pact for a third year in a row – and prescribe austerity measures designed to reign in germany ’ s deficit .
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel are fighting back , arguing that an inflexible interpretation of the pact – and resulting budget cuts – could hinder their ability to jump-start the ailing germany economy .
namely , they may not be able to proceed with plans to move-up proposed tax cuts from 2005 to 2004 , giving an injection of much-needed cash into the economy .
a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in berlin on thursday , “ we would ask the commission to take a level-headed approach and maintain a sense of proportion when formulating measures against germany and france . ”
the stability and growth pact was conceived to protect the value of the euro , and it calls for tough sanctions and fines of up to € 3 billion against countries that repeatedly violate the guidelines , which requires governments to keep deficits below 3 percent of the gdp .
equal treatment for france and germany a spokesman for pedro solbes , the eu monetary commissioner , confirmed on thursday that the commission planned to propose coercive measures to force germany to get its books in order .
however , the nature of the proposals was not disclosed . in principle , germany will be treated the same as france , which recently underwent a similar process of review , but was given an extra year , until 2005 , to get its deficit under control .
“ we plan to exercise the principle of treating all equally , ” said gerassimos thomas , solpes spokesman , in brussels on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france are a constant headache for eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
after paris failed to meet an october 3 deadline detailing how it planned to reduce the deficit , solbes -lrb- picture -rrb- announced that he would draw-up detailed budget recommendations , outlining how they should proceed .
this move was the most severe action taken by brussels to enforce the pact since its creation .
and now solbes plans to wield a similar mechanism against germany .
the commission plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how to proceed .
however , any proposals would need to be approved by all eu finance ministers .
in proceedings against france earlier this month , they failed to reach a consensus .
the latest in an ongoing battle germany and france have long been engaged in a battle with the commission over the stability and growth pact .
both have called for a more flexible interpretation of the pact , arguing that prescribing austerity measures aimed at slashing budgets would undercut each government ’ s ability to make funds available to spur the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to the last appeal " still rings true .
as recently as last month , at one of their frequent meetings , german chancellor gerhard shröder and french president jacques chirac made the argument anew .
both will violate the pact for a third year in a row next year , with recent german borrowing totalling more than € 40 billion threatening to bump the german deficit well above 4 percent .
what ’ s more , both countries have recently been forced to revise their growth estimates to little more than zero percent , dashing hopes that increased revenue will help make up the difference .
both governments , however , face a tough battle ahead .
many smaller eu countries , including austria and the netherlands , who have worked hard to keep their budgets under the limit , have made clear that they will not support special treatment for france and germany .
what ’ s more , jean claude trichet , the new president of the european central bank , is firmly on the side of the commission .

the german parliament decided on thursday to replace east germany 's former seat of government in berlin with a park until there 's money in the budget for more . only the two parliamentarians from the pds , the successor party to the east german communists , voted against razing the palace of the republic .
apparently , even discussing the issue appeared superfluous to parliament on thursday .
in any case , the decision to demolish one of berlin 's most infamous eyesores came as no surprise to anyone in germany . the real issue was what would come next .

federal minister for transport , building and housing , manfred stolpe , whose ministry will have to foot a large part of the bill for demolishing the building , argued against tearing it down in the near future .
the work is expected to cost around € 20 million , money that could be better used for other , more urgent problems , stolpe said . berlin 's senator for building , peter strieder , has supported a quick removal of the palace though and said a call for tenders should be made throughout europe as soon as possible .

while services in some parts of the country have improved , they appear to be getting worse in others .
few councils contrast more starkly than birmingham city council and east sussex county council .
last year both authorities received zero stars and were classed as failing .
twelve months on , birmingham is still languishing at the bottom the table while east sussex has soared up the ranks having collected two stars .
on the face of it , the performance of east sussex would suggest that it is quite easy to turn around a struggling social services department .
money talks according to the council , extra money and a clear focus make all the difference .
" the cabinet made improving services to older people its top priority and we invested millions of pounds to achieve this , " says councillor keith glazier , lead cabinet member for social services and health .
we have turned the corner and are making progress susanna mccorry , birmingham city council the council 's rating has been helped by the fact that its services for children were never that bad .
last year , they were ranked among the top 50 in the country .
poor social services for adults were dragging the council down .
the council spent an additional £ 7m on older people 's services last year .
it opened 40 new beds in short-term residential centres , which are designed to help older people return home after a spell in hospital .
it also increased the number of elderly people receiving intensive home care by 39 % .
the council also shored up its children 's services .
it recruited 28 more foster carers and helped to get more children adopted .
its adoption services are now ranked 8th best in england .
the situation in birmingham was always going to be more difficult to turn around .
birmingham city council is the largest local authority in england and one of the biggest in europe .
it serves a population of almost one million .
east sussex by comparison serves a population of about 500,000 .
turning around birmingham 's social services was always going to be like turning around a large tanker .
big problems birmingham 's problems were highlighted in september following the death of seven-year-old toni-ann byfield .
she and her 41-year-old father , a known drug dealer , were shot dead in a flat in north london .
we invested millions of pounds keith glazier , east sussex county council the seven-year-old was staying with her father for the weekend .
she was a ward of court , who had been known to birmingham social services since late last year .
the city council came in for criticism following toni-ann 's murder and carried out an internal investigation .
government inspectors are expected to say that urgent changes are needed when they publish a report shortly .
lin homer , the council 's chief executive , acknowledges that big improvements are needed .
" we accept that we are not currently serving all people well enough in providing social care and to that extent we do not yet deserve a star . "
she said the soon-to-be-made recommendations from government inspectors will be acted on quickly .
councillor susanna mccorry , the council 's cabinet member for social care and health , said the task of improving services should be seen as a " marathon not a sprint " .
" we have turned the corner and are making progress , " she said .
" we still have much to achieve .
however , i am confident that we are on course to deliver quality social care services for birmingham . "

last year the firm , which was rescued from bankruptcy by a massive government loan , made an 11m euro profit .
the results were worse than analysts had predicted , and came as new orders fell almost a quarter to 7.44bn euros .
much of the loss came from charges caused by accounting irregularities in one of the firm 's us units .
the scandal surrounding the accounting problems was the main trigger for the firm 's financial problems , along with cost over-runs on key projects and a weakening market for power equipment .
buried under debts approaching 5bn euros , alstom was only saved by a bailout from the government .
even that caused trouble , with the original package being thrown out by the european commission which said it amounted to illegal state aid .
a fresh set of loans and grants totalling 4.7bn euros was then agreed , but concerns remain about the company 's long-term future .
the rest of this year , the firm said , was unlikely to show much of an improvement .
" we expect this current fiscal year to be unsatisfactory both in terms of results and cash flow due to tough market conditions and the impact of the past uncertainties concerning our situation on our commercial activity , " alstom said in a statement .

rspb scotland said thousands of scottish puffins were washed up dead off the coast of spain following the spill , which led to over 60,000 tonnes of oil seeping into the sea .
the prestige broke up and sank off galicia on 13 november last year , devastating the local fishing industry and covering hundreds of beaches with oil .
darren kindleysides , from rspb scotland , said governments should do more to protect seabirds .
he said : " after the breeding season some birds move elsewhere , where they are subject to threats , such as oil spills .
shipping disaster " this incident was avoidable .
governments at home and abroad must take urgent measures to protect the most sensitive parts of europe 's coast and seas from future shipping disasters . "
he said that work carried out by the rspb 's sister organisation in spain - sociedad española de ornitología - showed that the majority of the puffins affected came from north and west scotland .

plymouth city council has dropped from having one star to none , a rating it shares with seven other authorities in england .
the department of health gives the star ratings based on the performance in providing services for adults and children .
devon county council has retained the two stars it had last time and torbay has kept its one star rating , while cornwall was awarded three stars .
the plymouth rating was expected after a highly critical report on its children and families services in may this year .
we 've set ourselves a target of getting to two stars within two years tudor evans , plymouth city council the council admitted at the time the department had " sunk as far as it can go " .
the problems highlighted included at-risk children not having their own social worker .
however , the leader of plymouth city council , tudor evans , said many things are already improving .
he said : " i 'm convinced that by this time next year , people will see the difference that has been made in many aspects of the services that we run .
" we 've set ourselves a target of getting to two stars within two years , and it 's much more difficult to gain stars than to lose them .
" the new administration has made considerable strides in improving services and we 've developed action plans for improving performances . "
in torbay , where the one star rating was retained , officials are not totally happy .
while torbay council is rated as " serving some people well " , the prospects for improvement are seen as " uncertain " .
the council said it feels the prospects for improving social services should have been rated as " promising " .

the losses are down from £ 458m a year ago , as the firm says its " long-term optimism looks increasingly justified " .
the company has recently emerged from a massive £ 4bn restructuring drive , shedding thousands of jobs and selling off units .
marconi said it had helped by rising sales , but that its markets remained hard to predict .
quarterly sales last month , marconi reported its first quarterly sales growth in 18 months , but said it saw no early respite from the downturn that nearly led to its collapse .
the group reported revenues in the three months to september were up 6 % to £ 389m -lrb- $ 649.6m -rrb- on the previous three months .
in a statement , chief executive mike parton admitted that the market was still difficult to predict beyond the current quarter .
" however , i believe our optimism for the longer term looks increasingly justified , " he said .
restructuring deal marconi stunned shareholders in july 2001 when it said operating profits would halve due to an industry-wide downturn .
it was forced to take drastic action after it borrowed heavily to fund an acquisition spree just as the telecoms boom was coming to an end .
the share price went into meltdown and the company , once a pillar of uk industry , had to enter a restructuring deal with its creditors .
a £ 4bn restructuring , which handed 99.5 % of the company 's equity to its creditors , was completed in may .

by richard hamilton in cape town will south africa 's wine industry be 15 % black-owned within five years ?
when south africa held its first democratic elections in 1994 the balance of political power finally turned .
since then the challenge for the country has been how to transfer economic power from a white minority to the black majority without destroying the economy itself .
that question is at the heart of the movement known as black economic empowerment , or bee , which has been a key but controversial policy of the anc government .
at a recent conference in cape town , wine industry executives discussed how to bring black empowerment to what is one of the country 's oldest industries .
more than window dressing although wine making is one of south africa 's best established industries , it is also seen as a bastion of white influence and affluence .
less than 1 % of wine producing companies are owned by black businessmen .
" ten years after south africa 's liberation , transformation in this sector has been non-existent , " gavin pieterse , the chairman of the south african wine industry trust -lrb- sawit -rrb- , told the conference .
for more than 300 years this industry has failed because it has not transferred skills to the majority jabulani ntshangase , winemaker john platter , a sawit trustee , said the conference was not just about recognising this .
" we have been keen not to do things for show .
our intention is to get a new body of well-educated people in place for the future , " he says .
" we all realise that something more than just window dressing has to happen . "
the conference delegates were keen to endorse the rhetoric but are they embracing black empowerment by choice or necessity ?
more stick than carrot ?
" many farmers still see black economic empowerment as a threat to their own existence , " says mohammad karaan , a lecturer at stellenbosch university .
" but their senses tell them that the future for white people in south africa will be based on their ability to constructively engage with black people .
" so maybe it is a bit of a stick but the carrot is that the government can provide things to encourage them . "
one such carrot is eu funding of about $ 15m for bee .
when a charter for the mining sector was leaked , it caused alarm among investors and shares prices tumbled jabulani ntshangase is one of south africa 's few black wine producers but he says he is not a supporter of black empowerment per se .
" we should not just throw black people into the industry without the proper skills and education , " he says .
" after the elections in 1994 many black-owned companies went onto the johannesburg stock exchange and many of them went out of business almost straight away .
" for more than 300 years this industry has failed because it has not transferred skills to the majority .
it is all about education but it wo n't happen overnight . "
too radical sawit is producing a charter targeting 10-15 % black ownership in the wine industry within five years .
charters have already been introduced for finance and mining companies , but not without a few bumps along the way .
as long as the anc focuses on transferring equity from one small group to another , its empowerment strategy will remain a myth for those who need it most mark lowe , opposition industry spokesman when the initial draft of a charter for the mining sector was leaked last year , it caused alarm among investors and shares prices tumbled .
the experience seemed to indicate that the changes envisioned were too radical for big investors to stomach and the government later negotiated a less demanding target of 26 % black ownership within 10 years .
criticism of black empowerment has also come from outside the investor community .
most south africans believe something must be done to increase opportunities for all but they still view bee as problematic .
some regard it as a form of discrimination , even " reverse racism " .
top down " i think it is immoral and obscene that people will qualify for top positions because they are black , " says mark lowe , trade and industry spokesman for the opposition democratic alliance .
he thinks the government has made the mistake of empowering from the top down and " playing the race card " .
there is no form of crony capitalism here lionel october , government industry spokesman " as long as the anc focuses on transferring equity from one small group to another , its empowerment strategy will remain a myth for those who need it most , " he says .
even the president 's brother , the businessman moeletsi mbeki , says the current brand of bee is really a political rather than an economic strategy that is enriching an elite of black businessmen close to the government .
he says it is doing little for the national economy .
and the statistics suggest that he may have a point .
duma gqubule , an economist who has studied bee , says that in the 10 years since bee 's creation , gdp per capita has dropped to the levels of 30 years ago and unemployment has doubled to eight million .
not just owners but managers but one of the prime movers behind bee , lionel october , the deputy director general of trade and industry , says the government has responded to the criticism by widening empowerment .
he says bee now entails not merely transfer of ownership but also participation in management and development of skills .
and both the government and the private sector are putting up cash to fund it , he says .
he also denies that bee benefits only the well-connected .
" there is no form of crony capitalism here , " he says .
for a country that has endured staggering racial inequality in the past , it is not surprising that its majority-elected government wants to see a greater slice of the cake for that majority .
but the government need look only as far as zimbabwe to see how an ostensible attempt to redress past inequalities can lead to economic chaos .
it knows it has to tread carefully if it is to avoid provoking the sort of turmoil that was so miraculously avoided a decade ago .

by richard hamilton in cape town will south africa 's wine industry be 15 % black-owned within five years ?
when south africa held its first democratic elections in 1994 the balance of political power finally turned .
since then the challenge for the country has been how to transfer economic power from a white minority to the black majority without destroying the economy itself .
that question is at the heart of the movement known as black economic empowerment , or bee , which has been a key but controversial policy of the anc government .
at a recent conference in cape town , wine industry executives discussed how to bring black empowerment to what is one of the country 's oldest industries .
more than window dressing although wine making is one of south africa 's best established industries , it is also seen as a bastion of white influence and affluence .
less than 1 % of wine producing companies are owned by black businessmen .
" ten years after south africa 's liberation , transformation in this sector has been non-existent , " gavin pieterse , the chairman of the south african wine industry trust -lrb- sawit -rrb- , told the conference .
for more than 300 years this industry has failed because it has not transferred skills to the majority jabulani ntshangase , winemaker john platter , a sawit trustee , said the conference was not just about recognising this .
" we have been keen not to do things for show .
our intention is to get a new body of well-educated people in place for the future , " he says .
" we all realise that something more than just window dressing has to happen . "
the conference delegates were keen to endorse the rhetoric but are they embracing black empowerment by choice or necessity ?
more stick than carrot ?
" many farmers still see black economic empowerment as a threat to their own existence , " says mohammad karaan , a lecturer at stellenbosch university .
" but their senses tell them that the future for white people in south africa will be based on their ability to constructively engage with black people .
" so maybe it is a bit of a stick but the carrot is that the government can provide things to encourage them . "
one such carrot is eu funding of about $ 15m for bee .
when a charter for the mining sector was leaked , it caused alarm among investors and shares prices tumbled jabulani ntshangase is one of south africa 's few black wine producers but he says he is not a supporter of black empowerment per se .
" we should not just throw black people into the industry without the proper skills and education , " he says .
" after the elections in 1994 many black-owned companies went onto the johannesburg stock exchange and many of them went out of business almost straight away .
" for more than 300 years this industry has failed because it has not transferred skills to the majority .
it is all about education but it wo n't happen overnight . "
too radical sawit is producing a charter targeting 10-15 % black ownership in the wine industry within five years .
charters have already been introduced for finance and mining companies , but not without a few bumps along the way .
as long as the anc focuses on transferring equity from one small group to another , its empowerment strategy will remain a myth for those who need it most mark lowe , opposition industry spokesman when the initial draft of a charter for the mining sector was leaked last year , it caused alarm among investors and shares prices tumbled .
the experience seemed to indicate that the changes envisioned were too radical for big investors to stomach and the government later negotiated a less demanding target of 26 % black ownership within 10 years .
criticism of black empowerment has also come from outside the investor community .
most south africans believe something must be done to increase opportunities for all but they still view bee as problematic .
some regard it as a form of discrimination , even " reverse racism " .
top down " i think it is immoral and obscene that people will qualify for top positions because they are black , " says mark lowe , trade and industry spokesman for the opposition democratic alliance .
he thinks the government has made the mistake of empowering from the top down and " playing the race card " .
there is no form of crony capitalism here lionel october , government industry spokesman " as long as the anc focuses on transferring equity from one small group to another , its empowerment strategy will remain a myth for those who need it most , " he says .
even the president 's brother , the businessman moeletsi mbeki , says the current brand of bee is really a political rather than an economic strategy that is enriching an elite of black businessmen close to the government .
he says it is doing little for the national economy .
and the statistics suggest that he may have a point .
duma gqubule , an economist who has studied bee , says that in the 10 years since bee 's creation , gdp per capita has dropped to the levels of 30 years ago and unemployment has doubled to eight million .
not just owners but managers but one of the prime movers behind bee , lionel october , the deputy director general of trade and industry , says the government has responded to the criticism by widening empowerment .
he says bee now entails not merely transfer of ownership but also participation in management and development of skills .
and both the government and the private sector are putting up cash to fund it , he says .
he also denies that bee benefits only the well-connected .
