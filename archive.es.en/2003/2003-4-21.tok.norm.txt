insulin-making genes were injected into the mice this new form of gene therapy , reported in the journal nature medicine , could lead to a novel approach for treating the growing problem of diabetes .
diabetics do not produce enough of the sugar-controlling hormone called insulin .
this means that they can not control their blood sugar levels , which can lead to serious problems with the kidneys , legs , eyes and heart .
if left untreated , diabetes can cause strokes and dementia , and even be fatal .
global problem diabetics can manage their condition by diet or through regular insulin injections , but this treatment is far from perfect .
so doctors have been looking at using gene therapy to improve care .
they have tried replacing damaged pancreatic cells - where insulin is made - with cells from healthy individuals but the procedure is risky .
so , instead , this team of scientists inserted insulin-making genes in diabetic mice .
this transformed liver cells into cells which then produced normal levels of insulin and meant that the diabetic mice appeared completely healthy .
gene therapy treatments like this could offer hope for controlling what is becoming a major health problem around the world .

the scottish social attitudes survey found that few people think devolution has given the public a greater say in how scotland is governed .
however , support for independence has only shown a small rise .
it now stands at 30 % , compared to 28 % who favoured that option in 1999 , according to the survey the natcen scotland research institute .
public confidence at the time of the first elections to the scottish parliament in 1999 , 70 % of people thought devolution would give scotland a stronger voice in the uk .
that figure fell to 52 % at the half-way point of the first parliament , and has continued to plunge to 39 % , according to statistics .
john curtice , co-director of the survey , said : " scotland 's politicians might have hoped that with the rows about clause 2a , the embarrassment of the scottish qualifications authority fiasco and parliamentary rows well behind them , public confidence would have begun to be restored .
" these results dash those hopes and show the scale of the task that faces all of scotland 's politicians as they try to persuade voters that the election on 1 may really matters . "
there has also been a drop in the belief that having a scottish parliament would give ordinary people more say in how scotland is governed .
in 1999 , polls showed that 64 % of people thought that would be the case , but two years later the figure went down to 38 % and it has carried on falling , to 31 % .
similarly , 56 % of scots thought devolution would improve education in scotland in 1999 , but the figure halved to 27 % at the time of the sqa exams fiasco in the summer of 2000 .
since then it has continued to fall further , to 25 % .
however , while there may be a feeling that devolution has brought little improvement , very few believe it has made things worse .
little change only 7 % believe it has weakened scotland 's voice within the uk , while 6 % think it has reduced the quality of scottish education , and 4 % believe that ordinary people have less say now in how they are governed .
and the disappointment with devolution has led to little change in the proportion of people who favour scrapping the parliament .
in 1999 , 10 % were of that view , but the figure has gone up to just 12 % now .
the survey was conducted with a random sample of 1,665 adults over 18 , interviewed face-to-face in their homes .

john curtice , co-director of the survey , said : " scotland 's politicians might have hoped that with the rows about clause 2a , the embarrassment of the scottish qualifications authority fiasco and parliamentary rows well behind them , public confidence would have begun to be restored .
support for independence showed a small rise " these results dash those hopes and show the scale of the task that faces all of scotland 's politicians as they try to persuade voters that the election on 1 may really matters . "
there has also been a drop in the belief that having a scottish parliament would give ordinary people more say in how scotland is governed .
in 1999 , polls showed that 64 % of people thought that would be the case , but two years later the figure went down to 38 % and it has carried on falling , to 31 % .
similarly , 56 % of scots thought devolution would improve education in scotland in 1999 , but the figure halved to 27 % at the time of the sqa exams fiasco in the summer of 2000 .
since then it has continued to fall further , to 25 % .
however , while there may be a feeling that devolution has brought little improvement , very few believe it has made things worse .
little change only 7 % believe it has weakened scotland 's voice within the uk , while 6 % think it has reduced the quality of scottish education , and 4 % believe that ordinary people have less say now in how they are governed .
and the disappointment with devolution has led to little change in the proportion of people who favour scrapping the parliament .
in 1999 , 10 % were of that view , but the figure has gone up to just 12 % now .
the survey was conducted with a random sample of 1,665 adults over 18 , interviewed face-to-face in their homes .

four different species of bats , which are protected by law , were found on the 17-acre site of the former st lawrence 's hospital in bodmin .
work by the south west regional development agency had started to transform the land into a business park , but now a bat consultant has been called in to make sure the mammals are not harmed .
space will now be made on the site for a special bat residence , which is being designed with the help of english nature .
some rare species of bats were found in the underground tunnels of the old hospital .
bat detectors robert mcguffie , the agency 's regeneration manager , said : " although we are looking at retaining some of the passageways , many will have to be filled in and most of the buildings will come down .
" because the bats are protected we are duty bound to rehouse them but with so many different species on site we 're going to need something special because they all have different needs . "
jane squirrell , from english nature , said : " we 've discovered a breeding roost of about 30 lesser horseshoe bats .
" these are rare bats in britain , only found now in south west england and wales .
" we 've also found pipistrelle , natterer 's and brown long eared bats , and a survey with bat detectors indicates there could be other bats such as whiskered or brandt 's bats as well . "
the bat hotel will have separate areas for breeding , feeding and hibernation .
some bats like to stretch their wings indoors to warm up before going outside , so there will also be enough space to allow them to fly indoors .

space will now be made on the site for a special bat residence , which is being designed with the help of english nature .
some rare species of bats were found in the underground tunnels of the old hospital .
bat detectors robert mcguffie , the agency 's regeneration manager , said : " although we are looking at retaining some of the passageways , many will have to be filled in and most of the buildings will come down .
" because the bats are protected we are duty bound to rehouse them but with so many different species on site we 're going to need something special because they all have different needs . "
jane squirrell , from english nature , said : " we 've discovered a breeding roost of about 30 lesser horseshoe bats .
" these are rare bats in britain , only found now in south west england and wales .
" we 've also found pipistrelle , natterer 's and brown long eared bats , and a survey with bat detectors indicates there could be other bats such as whiskered or brandt 's bats as well . "
the bat hotel will have separate areas for breeding , feeding and hibernation .
some bats like to stretch their wings indoors to warm up before going outside , so there will also be enough space to allow them to fly indoors .

westminster city council , the largest licensing authority in the country , says more police and better public transport are needed before any changes are made .
it has been lobbying for changes to the draft licensing legislation , which would allow bars to apply for licenses to serve alcohol all night .
now the council has written to the metropolitan police authority -lrb- mpa -rrb- and transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- about its concerns .
westminster has been told no extra police officers will be allocated to patrol its streets this year .
and there are fears londoners who stay out late to take advantage of longer drinking hours , will find themselves stranded .
councillor tim mitchell said : " we have already asked for the tube to run 24 hours on friday and saturday nights to help us deal with the thousands of people that throng the west end throughout the night .
" if we are going to have 24-hour drinking we need 24-hour transport .
more money needs to come from the government and tfl to improve the tube and bus system and make london the equal to new york . "
