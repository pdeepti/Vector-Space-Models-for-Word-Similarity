the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .
no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses . it ’ s unlikely that maurice garin could have envisaged how the tour de france would change in the hundred years that followed his victory back in 1903 . the french rider , known as “ the chimney sweep , ” was the first-ever winner of the world ’ s most famous cycling race when the field consisted of just 60 riders who rode through the night in pursuit of the prize .
now , in its centenary year , the tour boasts 22 teams , totaling 198 riders in a race that dwarfs the original 2,500 kilometer race by pushing the athletes to go a further 850 . but it ’ s not only the sheer size of the modern tour which would astound garin these days .
the tour de france has developed into more than just a sporting spectacle over the last hundred years .
the tour de france is now one of the most lucrative and expensive events in terms of business and finance with a staggering array of sponsors , partners , merchandisers and suppliers all paying for the privilege of being associated with the tour . 24 sponsors vie for audience of 1 billion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany , the 2002 king of the mountains .
the amaury sport organization , the tour 's official organizer , makes 70 percent of its € 110 million annual turnover from cycling .
the tour de france in turn makes up between 70 and 80 percent of its total cycling turnover every year .
most of the money comes from the television rights and the advertising revenue that is plowed into the tour by the army of 24 associated businesses that pay to have their logos beamed into the homes of over 1 billion people worldwide . it appears to be money well spent .
the organizers claim that for every euro invested in the tour de france , a sponsor is guaranteed ten back .
that goes some way to explain the masses of t-shirts , hats and umbrellas that color the 20 stages of the tour , sporting logos ranging from those of the main sponsors to official partners .
considering the global reach of the tour , sponsorship in any capacity is an attractive proposition for many businesses .
but as in any serious venture , the sponsors must reflect the event ’ s standing . “ you can ’ t just come to us and say ‘ i have a product , i want to sell that product ’ , ” said daniel bal , the tour ’ s deputy director .
“ if it works with our product , our logo and our colors , then we have a deal and we can work together . ” jerseys are most sought after items the most sought after items for sponsorship have been firmly in the hands of the giants of cycling patronage in france for many years .
the jerseys - awarded to the winners of the most-prestigious stages , the best newcomer and the overall tour winner - have long been coveted as the most lucrative vehicles for publicity hungry institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : my sponsor pays more money than your sponsor .
the fabled yellow jersey of the overall victor has been sponsored by french bank crédit lyonnais since 1987 , while the green jersey , awarded to the best sprinter , has been the reserve of the pmu , france ’ s horse racing association , for the past 13 years .
the best young rider of the tour will be presented with the white jersey , now back in the hands of the conseil général des hauts-de-seine social help organization after a ten year gap . only the king of the mountains ’ polka dot jersey has been wrestled away by a new sponsor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.07.2003 germany calls for greater un role in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer meets with senate majority leader bill frist ahead of meetings with bush administration members .
on the first leg of his four-day united states trip , german foreign minister joschka fischer called for further steps in rebuilding an iraqi government and made reconciliatory gestures to washington . one german newsmagazine has referred to fischer 's trip - his first visit to the u.s. since the outbreak of the war in iraq - as " mission impossible . "
although germany was among the staunchest opponents of the u.s.-led war , it is now taking on a stronger political role in the reshaping of the middle eastern country .
fischer 's trip to washington serves to underscore the country 's increasing profile in the debate over how to restore stability in the post-saddam hussein iraq and to rebuild an infrastructure that deteriorated dramatically following two wars and a decade of embargoes .
fischer told the u.s. public television broadcaster pbs on wednesday that germany considers it " very important that progress be made toward creating an iraqi government . "
fischer described the governing council in iraq that the u.s. established last sunday as " a step in the right direction " for building a government there .
yet once again , fischer demanded a central role for the united nations in iraq . the 25-person iraqi governing council , which has limited authority , was appointed under u.s. chief iraq administrator paul bremer , and had its first session on sunday .
according to the u.s. plan , this is the first step in the creation of a transitional iraqi government , which will pave the way for a constitution and elections - hopefully sometime within the next year . the u.s. has recently made it clear that it wants help in rebuilding iraq , especially from its nato allies .
american casualties in iraq continue to mount amid guerrilla fighting , and civil unrest is growing as iraqis grow increasingly frustrated that many basic services have not yet been restored .
military stretched to capacity nonetheless , expectations are low that the united states will pressure germany to send troops to iraq during fischer 's planned meetings wednesday with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleeza rice .
fischer stressed in the pbs interview that germany 's peacekeeping activities in afghanistan , the balkans , africa and elsewhere have already stretched its military to full capacity .
in the past , germany had named the existence of an iraqi transitional government and a new u.n. mandate as conditions for a debate over whether it would send its own soldiers to support u.s. und british troops in stabilizing iraq .
more recently , however , german chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that the united states can not count on germany sending troops .
seeking iraqi stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt in an interview with german public television , top fischer aid karsten voigt -lrb- photo -rrb- denied that the fence-mending trip represents any major change in relations between the two countries .
" there was always contact between fischer and powell , before the war , during the war , and after the war , " he said . " but now it is naturally a question of showing the americans that germans , although they were and are opposed to this war , are nonetheless interested in making iraq into a stable place , where human rights and democracy can get a foothold . "
poor policy voigt addressed u.s. expectations of germany and other nato members to come forward to help stabilize iraq in particularly blunt language . " i ca n't imagine that a country that did n't want to go to war , did n't win the war , and that is therefore not an occupying force , can or should operate under conditions set by the operating force in iraq .
if at all , it should only be under u.n.-established conditions .
i do n't know whether the americans are ready for that , " he said .
even if the german troops were n't already stretched too thin , voigt added , " i do n't think it is a meaningful german policy to jump from deployment to deployment without doing any serious long-term planning . ...
that means you do n't jump from flower to flower and try to suck the nectar out , and then believe that you gain influence that way .
you only gain influence if by solving problems . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mr. fischer heads to washington german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .

critics said the loss of tax revenues in 2004 would create a budget gap of at least € 7 billion and further burden the already slumping german economy . but schröder and eichel said encouraging consumer spending was more important to them right now than future budget holes .
to make up for the gap , the government will borrow between € 4 and € 5 billion , privatize and cut subsidies for farmers and builders .
opposition politicians immediately responded to eichel and schröder 's announcement wednesday afternoon by saying they hoped for more subsidy cuts and less borrowing .
the coalition government will introduce its finance plans to parliament on aug .

political observers are certain that the plans will not pass in their present form . thomas cook slumping , announces job cuts battered by the slumping tourism industry , german tourism giant thomas cook announced wednesday it was stepping up its savings course with job cuts .
after posting their first-ever losses and announcing that bookings were down earlier in the year , thomas cook said it would cut one in every five jobs in germany .
around 1,200 jobs will be slashed in the next three years , the company said .
a spokesman said the figure was assuming " the worst-case scenario " and might not be reached . but the announcement was the latest in a series of blows the industry has dealt the company .
at the beginning of 2003 , thomas cook posted a € 119.5 million -lrb- $ 133.99 million -rrb- loss for the 2001-2002 fiscal year .
as part of a savings course , the company cut 500 jobs . hypovereinsbank sells daughter bank hypovereinsbank , germany 's second largest bank , completed the sale of its daughter bank to frankfurt-based dz bank , hvb announced on wednesday .
the munich bank sold norisbank to dz for 447 million euros , earning a capital gain of € 250 million for itself . hvb said the sale is a move forward towards its goal to drive its tier 1 capital ratio from 5.7 percent to 7 percent by the end of the year .
dz is expected to benefit from norisbank 's consumer finance products know-how .
the dz will overtake norisbank at the end of september . more germans banking online more germans are heading online for their banking needs according to new figures from the german association of banks .
there were 30 million bank accounts managed in 2002 , indicating that an increasing number of germans are preferring the tap of keys and click of the mouse to standing in lines at local branches .

in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .
the concept is being championed by berlin advertising agency herr ledesi , which has been promoting the range of clothing through a poster campaign on billboards and in magazines . after hearing about the products the prisoners were making for their own use , agency chief stephan bohle identified the clothing project as the fashion client that his team were looking for .
“ we went to the prison after hearing about the products and were very pleased by the quality .
it was then that we decided this would be a very interesting project to be involved in , ” bohle told deutsche welle . initiating a campaign aimed at hitting the trend seekers and setters of the capital ’ s hot spots and bar scene around berlin ’ s trendy mitte and prenzlauer berg neighborhoods , the agency played on the current market desire for unusual yet simple designs . unusual and simple “ people are always looking for fashion that ’ s out of the ordinary but simple , ” said bohle .
“ there are thousands of types of shoes out there but these shoes are hand-made and worn by prisoners … they ’ re special . ” bohle and his team applied market psychology to market the haeftling range in such a way as to snare the fashionistas : “ it ’ s about unusual labels ; it ’ s about telling a story , delivering an authentic message and conveying credibility . ”
by being up front about the origins of the clothing , bohle believes it will only be a matter of time before the haeftling -lrb- prisoner -rrb- line takes on a cult following .
indeed , the initial reception indicates that his instincts are spot on . european wide demand the haeftling internet shop went online july 11 , and since then bohle has been amazed at the response .
“ sales for the clothing have been incredible , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gone europe-wide .
we ’ re selling not just in germany , but britain , the netherlands , scandinavia and austria . ” the products themselves seem to live up to herr ledesi ’ s philosophy of transparency .
with solid and functional pin-striped shirts in prison-issue blue - which come complete with an identification tag - robust boots and heavy jackets more suited for cold mornings in the exercise yard , the haeftling range makes no secret of where it comes from and who made it . project helps prisoners in the tegel prison , about 40 percent of the 1,700 prisoners do n't do any work within the system , meaning that they have access to little money other than the € 26 monthly allowance given to them by the government . but those working on the clothing line can earn an extra € 7.50 to € 12.50 a day .
prison authorities hope that the success of the project can help inmates find work within the facility and , once they are released , in the outside world .
it is also seen as a motivational tool which boosts self confidence and esteem . whatever your views on wearing fashions created by the incarcerated , one thing is certain : once haeftling products are seen draped over a celebrity at a premiere or glittering party , wearing clothes made by people from the penal system will become so last year , darling . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art breaks through prison walls an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special .

prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund . pressured by the bush administration at the annual g8 summit in evian this year , europe 's leaders pledged to donate 1 billion euros to the u.n. aids-fighting fund this year .
the amount is supposed to match the $ 1 billion promised to the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria by u.s. president george w. bush this year , part of his government 's ambitious $ 15 billion package to fight aids in africa and the caribbean .
but the european union 's contribution remains heavily debated on the eve of the fund 's annual donor conference in paris .
at an eu summit in thessaloniki at the beginning of the month , the 15-member body was unable to unanimously approve the amount , pledged by french president jacques chirac .
germany and the netherlands , countries that are facing shrinking budgets , said they would be hard-pressed to find the money to back their pledge .
germany already spends around € 300 million a year on fighting aids .
of that amount in 2004 , € 38 million will go to the global fund .
following the government 's hesitation in thessaloniki , germany 's development minister quickly upped her contribution amid growing criticism .
berlin criticized by aids groups germany has pledged € 300 million to the fund until 2007 , € 100 million more than initially planned .
after the € 38 million slated for next year , berlin will gradually increase its fund contribution for the next three years .
the government has so far contributed € 50 million to the fund .
" we are taking our responsibility in fighting aids seriously , " minister for development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said earlier this month .
but whether the € 1 billion eu pledge will become reality , depends on germany contributing more , according to non-profit organizations involved in combating aids .
on tuesday , doctors without borders asked the german government to contribute € 100 million to the fund this year .
though appreciative of wieczorek-zeul 's recent increase , the international organization said that " without the 1 billion euro from the eu -lrb- we 're -rrb- concerned the global fund wo n't be functional anymore . "

stuck for a new look this summer ?
many people wanting to revamp their wardrobe are turning to fashions created , worn and sold by inmates at the tegel prison in berlin . the fashion world is a fickle one .
no one with any sense of what ’ s hot and what ’ s not would be seen dead in anything other than the latest collections .
in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .
the concept is being championed by berlin advertising agency herr ledesi , which has been promoting the range of clothing through a poster campaign on billboards and in magazines . after hearing about the products the prisoners were making for their own use , agency chief stephan bohle identified the clothing project as the fashion client that his team were looking for .
“ we went to the prison after hearing about the products and were very pleased by the quality .
it was then that we decided this would be a very interesting project to be involved in , ” bohle told deutsche welle . initiating a campaign aimed at hitting the trend seekers and setters of the capital ’ s hot spots and bar scene around berlin ’ s trendy mitte and prenzlauer berg neighborhoods , the agency played on the current market desire for unusual yet simple designs . unusual and simple “ people are always looking for fashion that ’ s out of the ordinary but simple , ” said bohle .
“ there are thousands of types of shoes out there but these shoes are hand-made and worn by prisoners … they ’ re special . ” bohle and his team applied market psychology to market the haeftling range in such a way as to snare the fashionistas : “ it ’ s about unusual labels ; it ’ s about telling a story , delivering an authentic message and conveying credibility . ”
by being up front about the origins of the clothing , bohle believes it will only be a matter of time before the haeftling -lrb- prisoner -rrb- line takes on a cult following .
indeed , the initial reception indicates that his instincts are spot on . european wide demand the haeftling internet shop went online july 11 , and since then bohle has been amazed at the response .
“ sales for the clothing have been incredible , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gone europe-wide .
we ’ re selling not just in germany , but britain , the netherlands , scandinavia and austria . ” the products themselves seem to live up to herr ledesi ’ s philosophy of transparency .
with solid and functional pin-striped shirts in prison-issue blue - which come complete with an identification tag - robust boots and heavy jackets more suited for cold mornings in the exercise yard , the haeftling range makes no secret of where it comes from and who made it . project helps prisoners in the tegel prison , about 40 percent of the 1,700 prisoners do n't do any work within the system , meaning that they have access to little money other than the € 26 monthly allowance given to them by the government . but those working on the clothing line can earn an extra € 7.50 to € 12.50 a day .
prison authorities hope that the success of the project can help inmates find work within the facility and , once they are released , in the outside world .
it is also seen as a motivational tool which boosts self confidence and esteem . whatever your views on wearing fashions created by the incarcerated , one thing is certain : once haeftling products are seen draped over a celebrity at a premiere or glittering party , wearing clothes made by people from the penal system will become so last year , darling . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art breaks through prison walls an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special .

a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift . german chancellor schröder may have cancelled his vacation to the sunny adriatic coast in a huff , but he could still head to the west german mining town of bochum for a touch of mediterranean flair .
maybe even some reassurance that the current row with his italian neighbors may be just a minor blip in otherwise robust relations .
with uncanny timing an exhibition has opened at the zeche hanover museum in bochum documenting a rather different italian german story than the stormy one being played out on the political stage with discussions reduced to spaghetti and sauerkraut .
under the rather unwieldy name " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " the show takes a personal trip back to the 1950s when germany signed a recruitment treaty in 1955 with italy that resulted in two simultaneous migratory waves that could hardly have been more different : while italian " guestworkers " came in droves to germany seeking work in the industrial ruhr region , the postwar german economic miracle had the first vacationers packing their bags and heading to italy 's sunny beaches .
warm socks and a vespa for germany with over 350 exhibits , the show documents the daily routine of italians working in the mines , railway works and construction sites in the ruhr region in the 1950s and presents kitschy holiday souvenirs from the first german vacations in italy .
museum spokesman markus fischer told deutsche welle that a large part of the exhibits stem from private collections .
" we approached several italians as well as germans who still live in the area and they generously gave us personal items from that time such as razors and even a pair of socks lovingly knitted by an italian mama for her son to keep him warm in the cold ruhr region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition in bochum other personal paraphernalia include immersion heaters bought by the mazzarisis family to warm their cold home shortly after their arrival , a spaghetti machine that don cataldo carted with him over the alps , dog-eared dictionaries and work contracts , the obligatory vespa as well as a railway bench that was allegedly a popular haunt of the italian migrant community .
several fading and yellowed photographs also go back further in history and chart the long migratory tradition of italian workers to germany which began at the beginning of the 19th century , suffered under a period of forced labor during nazi times in the early 1940s and then picked up again after the war as a flurry of advertising lured italians to make a lucrative new beginning on the other side of the alps .

about four million germans are estimated to have traveled to italy in 1958 alone . the exhibit 's artifacts include glass vases , chic italian shoes , snazzy sunglasses and entire photo albums - all of which are designed to depict the way germans took their vacations to italy in beetles and trailers .
homesick and lonely but it ’ s not just nostalgic and romantic documentation that the show deals with .
the exhibition also shows the darker side of italian migratory labor in germany .
many workers were forced to live in cramped quarters in former army barracks , had to suffer insulting nicknames such as " macaroni " and deal with clichés of being short-tempered and haughty .
language problems and homesickness added to their misery with the result that there was hardly any contact between the germans and italians - at least not in the beginning .

italian guestworkers seek love and understanding , " the daily ruhr nachrichten wrote in 1962 .
exhibition enjoys wide attention fischer said the last bit of the exhibition , titled " what remains ? , " includes interviews conducted with both germans and italians in the ruhr region to find out how their lives had turned out and encompasses biographies that could n't be much different in terms of experience .
" what 's left are plenty of human relationship , but also many italian clichés that the advertising industry effectively exploits as well as many german stereotypes that still work the same way they did then , " one of the exhibit 's curators , anke asfur , told a german newspaper . it is n't hard to find some truth in asfur 's observation , especially in light of the anti-german tirades of italian ministers in recent days , in particular tourism minister stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists as " hypernationlistic blondes " that eventually led to the german chancellor scrapping his summer vacation to italy .

fischer said they were also receiving an avalanche of e-mails from visitors , which ran the gamut from " apoplectic rage over the comments to exasperation at the chancellor ’ s stance . "
" but many are also moderate in their views , " fischer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.07.2003 looking back at german-italian relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun , fun and beautiful women - germans headed for italy 's sunny beaches in droves as far back as the 1950s .
a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift . german chancellor schröder may have cancelled his vacation to the sunny adriatic coast in a huff , but he could still head to the west german mining town of bochum for a touch of mediterranean flair .
maybe even some reassurance that the current row with his italian neighbors may be just a minor blip in otherwise robust relations .
with uncanny timing an exhibition has opened at the zeche hanover museum in bochum documenting a rather different italian german story than the stormy one being played out on the political stage with discussions reduced to spaghetti and sauerkraut .
under the rather unwieldy name " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " the show takes a personal trip back to the 1950s when germany signed a recruitment treaty in 1955 with italy that resulted in two simultaneous migratory waves that could hardly have been more different : while italian " guestworkers " came in droves to germany seeking work in the industrial ruhr region , the postwar german economic miracle had the first vacationers packing their bags and heading to italy 's sunny beaches .
warm socks and a vespa for germany with over 350 exhibits , the show documents the daily routine of italians working in the mines , railway works and construction sites in the ruhr region in the 1950s and presents kitschy holiday souvenirs from the first german vacations in italy .
museum spokesman markus fischer told deutsche welle that a large part of the exhibits stem from private collections .
" we approached several italians as well as germans who still live in the area and they generously gave us personal items from that time such as razors and even a pair of socks lovingly knitted by an italian mama for her son to keep him warm in the cold ruhr region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition in bochum other personal paraphernalia include immersion heaters bought by the mazzarisis family to warm their cold home shortly after their arrival , a spaghetti machine that don cataldo carted with him over the alps , dog-eared dictionaries and work contracts , the obligatory vespa as well as a railway bench that was allegedly a popular haunt of the italian migrant community .
several fading and yellowed photographs also go back further in history and chart the long migratory tradition of italian workers to germany which began at the beginning of the 19th century , suffered under a period of forced labor during nazi times in the early 1940s and then picked up again after the war as a flurry of advertising lured italians to make a lucrative new beginning on the other side of the alps .
the italian " guest workers " played an extremely critical role in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
germans discover love for chic italia meanwhile , paradise beckoned for german tourists , who were lured by colorful brochures touting italy 's virtues , romantic film posters and pop records .
with increasing buying power and longer vacations , germans flocked to italy in droves during the 1950s .
about four million germans are estimated to have traveled to italy in 1958 alone . the exhibit 's artifacts include glass vases , chic italian shoes , snazzy sunglasses and entire photo albums - all of which are designed to depict the way germans took their vacations to italy in beetles and trailers .
homesick and lonely but it ’ s not just nostalgic and romantic documentation that the show deals with .
the exhibition also shows the darker side of italian migratory labor in germany .
many workers were forced to live in cramped quarters in former army barracks , had to suffer insulting nicknames such as " macaroni " and deal with clichés of being short-tempered and haughty .
language problems and homesickness added to their misery with the result that there was hardly any contact between the germans and italians - at least not in the beginning .
the show also includes newspaper cuttings from the time that complained about the isolation of the southerners .
" after work they are strangers .
italian guestworkers seek love and understanding , " the daily ruhr nachrichten wrote in 1962 .
exhibition enjoys wide attention fischer said the last bit of the exhibition , titled " what remains ? , " includes interviews conducted with both germans and italians in the ruhr region to find out how their lives had turned out and encompasses biographies that could n't be much different in terms of experience .
" what 's left are plenty of human relationship , but also many italian clichés that the advertising industry effectively exploits as well as many german stereotypes that still work the same way they did then , " one of the exhibit 's curators , anke asfur , told a german newspaper . it is n't hard to find some truth in asfur 's observation , especially in light of the anti-german tirades of italian ministers in recent days , in particular tourism minister stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists as " hypernationlistic blondes " that eventually led to the german chancellor scrapping his summer vacation to italy .
a hotline and hate mail the show ’ s organizers said they were pleased with the unexpected attention their exhibition has attracted and have even set up a hotline where people can phone in to vent their feelings about the current diplomatic row .
fischer said they were also receiving an avalanche of e-mails from visitors , which ran the gamut from " apoplectic rage over the comments to exasperation at the chancellor ’ s stance . "
" but many are also moderate in their views , " fischer said .
" but i do hope the exhibition will help to finally bring the spiraling row back to earth . "
the exhibition , " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " is on at the zeche hanover museum in bochum from july 12 to october 26 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the zeche hanover museum in bochum extensive information in english about the zeche hanover museum and its current exhibits .

on the first leg of his four-day united states trip , german foreign minister joschka fischer called for further steps in rebuilding an iraqi government and made reconciliatory gestures to washington . one german newsmagazine has referred to fischer 's trip - his first visit to the u.s. since the outbreak of the war in iraq - as " mission impossible . "
although germany was among the staunchest opponents of the u.s.-led war , it is now taking on a stronger political role in the reshaping of the middle eastern country .
fischer 's trip to washington serves to underscore the country 's increasing profile in the debate over how to restore stability in the post-saddam hussein iraq and to rebuild an infrastructure that deteriorated dramatically following two wars and a decade of embargoes .
fischer told the u.s. public television broadcaster pbs on wednesday that germany considers it " very important that progress be made toward creating an iraqi government . "
fischer described the governing council in iraq that the u.s. established last sunday as " a step in the right direction " for building a government there .
yet once again , fischer demanded a central role for the united nations in iraq . the 25-person iraqi governing council , which has limited authority , was appointed under u.s. chief iraq administrator paul bremer , and had its first session on sunday .
according to the u.s. plan , this is the first step in the creation of a transitional iraqi government , which will pave the way for a constitution and elections - hopefully sometime within the next year . the u.s. has recently made it clear that it wants help in rebuilding iraq , especially from its nato allies .
american casualties in iraq continue to mount amid guerrilla fighting , and civil unrest is growing as iraqis grow increasingly frustrated that many basic services have not yet been restored .
military stretched to capacity nonetheless , expectations are low that the united states will pressure germany to send troops to iraq during fischer 's planned meetings wednesday with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleeza rice .
fischer stressed in the pbs interview that germany 's peacekeeping activities in afghanistan , the balkans , africa and elsewhere have already stretched its military to full capacity .
in the past , germany had named the existence of an iraqi transitional government and a new u.n. mandate as conditions for a debate over whether it would send its own soldiers to support u.s. und british troops in stabilizing iraq .
more recently , however , german chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that the united states can not count on germany sending troops .
seeking iraqi stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt in an interview with german public television , top fischer aid karsten voigt -lrb- photo -rrb- denied that the fence-mending trip represents any major change in relations between the two countries .
" there was always contact between fischer and powell , before the war , during the war , and after the war , " he said . " but now it is naturally a question of showing the americans that germans , although they were and are opposed to this war , are nonetheless interested in making iraq into a stable place , where human rights and democracy can get a foothold . "
poor policy voigt addressed u.s. expectations of germany and other nato members to come forward to help stabilize iraq in particularly blunt language . " i ca n't imagine that a country that did n't want to go to war , did n't win the war , and that is therefore not an occupying force , can or should operate under conditions set by the operating force in iraq .
if at all , it should only be under u.n.-established conditions .
i do n't know whether the americans are ready for that , " he said .
even if the german troops were n't already stretched too thin , voigt added , " i do n't think it is a meaningful german policy to jump from deployment to deployment without doing any serious long-term planning . ...

fischer told the u.s. public television broadcaster pbs on wednesday that germany considers it " very important that progress be made toward creating an iraqi government . "
fischer described the governing council in iraq that the u.s. established last sunday as " a step in the right direction " for building a government there .
yet once again , fischer demanded a central role for the united nations in iraq . the 25-person iraqi governing council , which has limited authority , was appointed under u.s. chief iraq administrator paul bremer , and had its first session on sunday .
according to the u.s. plan , this is the first step in the creation of a transitional iraqi government , which will pave the way for a constitution and elections - hopefully sometime within the next year . the u.s. has recently made it clear that it wants help in rebuilding iraq , especially from its nato allies .
american casualties in iraq continue to mount amid guerrilla fighting , and civil unrest is growing as iraqis grow increasingly frustrated that many basic services have not yet been restored .
military stretched to capacity nonetheless , expectations are low that the united states will pressure germany to send troops to iraq during fischer 's planned meetings wednesday with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleeza rice .
fischer stressed in the pbs interview that germany 's peacekeeping activities in afghanistan , the balkans , africa and elsewhere have already stretched its military to full capacity .
in the past , germany had named the existence of an iraqi transitional government and a new u.n. mandate as conditions for a debate over whether it would send its own soldiers to support u.s. und british troops in stabilizing iraq .
more recently , however , german chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that the united states can not count on germany sending troops .
seeking iraqi stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt in an interview with german public television , top fischer aid karsten voigt -lrb- photo -rrb- denied that the fence-mending trip represents any major change in relations between the two countries .
" there was always contact between fischer and powell , before the war , during the war , and after the war , " he said . " but now it is naturally a question of showing the americans that germans , although they were and are opposed to this war , are nonetheless interested in making iraq into a stable place , where human rights and democracy can get a foothold . "
poor policy voigt addressed u.s. expectations of germany and other nato members to come forward to help stabilize iraq in particularly blunt language . " i ca n't imagine that a country that did n't want to go to war , did n't win the war , and that is therefore not an occupying force , can or should operate under conditions set by the operating force in iraq .

i do n't know whether the americans are ready for that , " he said .

on the first leg of his four-day united states trip , german foreign minister joschka fischer called for further steps in rebuilding an iraqi government and made reconciliatory gestures to washington . one german newsmagazine has referred to fischer 's trip - his first visit to the u.s. since the outbreak of the war in iraq - as " mission impossible . "

a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift . german chancellor schröder may have cancelled his vacation to the sunny adriatic coast in a huff , but he could still head to the west german mining town of bochum for a touch of mediterranean flair .
maybe even some reassurance that the current row with his italian neighbors may be just a minor blip in otherwise robust relations .
with uncanny timing an exhibition has opened at the zeche hanover museum in bochum documenting a rather different italian german story than the stormy one being played out on the political stage with discussions reduced to spaghetti and sauerkraut .
under the rather unwieldy name " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " the show takes a personal trip back to the 1950s when germany signed a recruitment treaty in 1955 with italy that resulted in two simultaneous migratory waves that could hardly have been more different : while italian " guestworkers " came in droves to germany seeking work in the industrial ruhr region , the postwar german economic miracle had the first vacationers packing their bags and heading to italy 's sunny beaches .
warm socks and a vespa for germany with over 350 exhibits , the show documents the daily routine of italians working in the mines , railway works and construction sites in the ruhr region in the 1950s and presents kitschy holiday souvenirs from the first german vacations in italy .
museum spokesman markus fischer told deutsche welle that a large part of the exhibits stem from private collections .
" we approached several italians as well as germans who still live in the area and they generously gave us personal items from that time such as razors and even a pair of socks lovingly knitted by an italian mama for her son to keep him warm in the cold ruhr region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition in bochum other personal paraphernalia include immersion heaters bought by the mazzarisis family to warm their cold home shortly after their arrival , a spaghetti machine that don cataldo carted with him over the alps , dog-eared dictionaries and work contracts , the obligatory vespa as well as a railway bench that was allegedly a popular haunt of the italian migrant community .
several fading and yellowed photographs also go back further in history and chart the long migratory tradition of italian workers to germany which began at the beginning of the 19th century , suffered under a period of forced labor during nazi times in the early 1940s and then picked up again after the war as a flurry of advertising lured italians to make a lucrative new beginning on the other side of the alps .
the italian " guest workers " played an extremely critical role in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
germans discover love for chic italia meanwhile , paradise beckoned for german tourists , who were lured by colorful brochures touting italy 's virtues , romantic film posters and pop records .
with increasing buying power and longer vacations , germans flocked to italy in droves during the 1950s .
about four million germans are estimated to have traveled to italy in 1958 alone . the exhibit 's artifacts include glass vases , chic italian shoes , snazzy sunglasses and entire photo albums - all of which are designed to depict the way germans took their vacations to italy in beetles and trailers .
homesick and lonely but it ’ s not just nostalgic and romantic documentation that the show deals with .
the exhibition also shows the darker side of italian migratory labor in germany .
many workers were forced to live in cramped quarters in former army barracks , had to suffer insulting nicknames such as " macaroni " and deal with clichés of being short-tempered and haughty .
language problems and homesickness added to their misery with the result that there was hardly any contact between the germans and italians - at least not in the beginning .
the show also includes newspaper cuttings from the time that complained about the isolation of the southerners .
" after work they are strangers .
italian guestworkers seek love and understanding , " the daily ruhr nachrichten wrote in 1962 .
exhibition enjoys wide attention fischer said the last bit of the exhibition , titled " what remains ? , " includes interviews conducted with both germans and italians in the ruhr region to find out how their lives had turned out and encompasses biographies that could n't be much different in terms of experience .
" what 's left are plenty of human relationship , but also many italian clichés that the advertising industry effectively exploits as well as many german stereotypes that still work the same way they did then , " one of the exhibit 's curators , anke asfur , told a german newspaper . it is n't hard to find some truth in asfur 's observation , especially in light of the anti-german tirades of italian ministers in recent days , in particular tourism minister stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists as " hypernationlistic blondes " that eventually led to the german chancellor scrapping his summer vacation to italy .
a hotline and hate mail the show ’ s organizers said they were pleased with the unexpected attention their exhibition has attracted and have even set up a hotline where people can phone in to vent their feelings about the current diplomatic row .
fischer said they were also receiving an avalanche of e-mails from visitors , which ran the gamut from " apoplectic rage over the comments to exasperation at the chancellor ’ s stance . "
" but many are also moderate in their views , " fischer said .
" but i do hope the exhibition will help to finally bring the spiraling row back to earth . "
the exhibition , " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " is on at the zeche hanover museum in bochum from july 12 to october 26 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the zeche hanover museum in bochum extensive information in english about the zeche hanover museum and its current exhibits .

the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .
no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses . it ’ s unlikely that maurice garin could have envisaged how the tour de france would change in the hundred years that followed his victory back in 1903 . the french rider , known as “ the chimney sweep , ” was the first-ever winner of the world ’ s most famous cycling race when the field consisted of just 60 riders who rode through the night in pursuit of the prize .
now , in its centenary year , the tour boasts 22 teams , totaling 198 riders in a race that dwarfs the original 2,500 kilometer race by pushing the athletes to go a further 850 . but it ’ s not only the sheer size of the modern tour which would astound garin these days .
the tour de france has developed into more than just a sporting spectacle over the last hundred years .
the tour de france is now one of the most lucrative and expensive events in terms of business and finance with a staggering array of sponsors , partners , merchandisers and suppliers all paying for the privilege of being associated with the tour . 24 sponsors vie for audience of 1 billion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel of germany , the 2002 king of the mountains .
the amaury sport organization , the tour 's official organizer , makes 70 percent of its € 110 million annual turnover from cycling .
the tour de france in turn makes up between 70 and 80 percent of its total cycling turnover every year .
most of the money comes from the television rights and the advertising revenue that is plowed into the tour by the army of 24 associated businesses that pay to have their logos beamed into the homes of over 1 billion people worldwide . it appears to be money well spent .
the organizers claim that for every euro invested in the tour de france , a sponsor is guaranteed ten back .
that goes some way to explain the masses of t-shirts , hats and umbrellas that color the 20 stages of the tour , sporting logos ranging from those of the main sponsors to official partners .
considering the global reach of the tour , sponsorship in any capacity is an attractive proposition for many businesses .
but as in any serious venture , the sponsors must reflect the event ’ s standing . “ you can ’ t just come to us and say ‘ i have a product , i want to sell that product ’ , ” said daniel bal , the tour ’ s deputy director .
“ if it works with our product , our logo and our colors , then we have a deal and we can work together . ” jerseys are most sought after items the most sought after items for sponsorship have been firmly in the hands of the giants of cycling patronage in france for many years .
the jerseys - awarded to the winners of the most-prestigious stages , the best newcomer and the overall tour winner - have long been coveted as the most lucrative vehicles for publicity hungry institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : my sponsor pays more money than your sponsor .

stuck for a new look this summer ?
many people wanting to revamp their wardrobe are turning to fashions created , worn and sold by inmates at the tegel prison in berlin . the fashion world is a fickle one .
no one with any sense of what ’ s hot and what ’ s not would be seen dead in anything other than the latest collections .
in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .
the concept is being championed by berlin advertising agency herr ledesi , which has been promoting the range of clothing through a poster campaign on billboards and in magazines . after hearing about the products the prisoners were making for their own use , agency chief stephan bohle identified the clothing project as the fashion client that his team were looking for .
“ we went to the prison after hearing about the products and were very pleased by the quality .
it was then that we decided this would be a very interesting project to be involved in , ” bohle told deutsche welle . initiating a campaign aimed at hitting the trend seekers and setters of the capital ’ s hot spots and bar scene around berlin ’ s trendy mitte and prenzlauer berg neighborhoods , the agency played on the current market desire for unusual yet simple designs . unusual and simple “ people are always looking for fashion that ’ s out of the ordinary but simple , ” said bohle .
“ there are thousands of types of shoes out there but these shoes are hand-made and worn by prisoners … they ’ re special . ” bohle and his team applied market psychology to market the haeftling range in such a way as to snare the fashionistas : “ it ’ s about unusual labels ; it ’ s about telling a story , delivering an authentic message and conveying credibility . ”
by being up front about the origins of the clothing , bohle believes it will only be a matter of time before the haeftling -lrb- prisoner -rrb- line takes on a cult following .
indeed , the initial reception indicates that his instincts are spot on . european wide demand the haeftling internet shop went online july 11 , and since then bohle has been amazed at the response .
“ sales for the clothing have been incredible , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gone europe-wide .
we ’ re selling not just in germany , but britain , the netherlands , scandinavia and austria . ” the products themselves seem to live up to herr ledesi ’ s philosophy of transparency .
with solid and functional pin-striped shirts in prison-issue blue - which come complete with an identification tag - robust boots and heavy jackets more suited for cold mornings in the exercise yard , the haeftling range makes no secret of where it comes from and who made it . project helps prisoners in the tegel prison , about 40 percent of the 1,700 prisoners do n't do any work within the system , meaning that they have access to little money other than the € 26 monthly allowance given to them by the government . but those working on the clothing line can earn an extra € 7.50 to € 12.50 a day .
prison authorities hope that the success of the project can help inmates find work within the facility and , once they are released , in the outside world .
it is also seen as a motivational tool which boosts self confidence and esteem . whatever your views on wearing fashions created by the incarcerated , one thing is certain : once haeftling products are seen draped over a celebrity at a premiere or glittering party , wearing clothes made by people from the penal system will become so last year , darling . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art breaks through prison walls an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special .

stuck for a new look this summer ?
many people wanting to revamp their wardrobe are turning to fashions created , worn and sold by inmates at the tegel prison in berlin . the fashion world is a fickle one .
no one with any sense of what ’ s hot and what ’ s not would be seen dead in anything other than the latest collections .
in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .
the concept is being championed by berlin advertising agency herr ledesi , which has been promoting the range of clothing through a poster campaign on billboards and in magazines . after hearing about the products the prisoners were making for their own use , agency chief stephan bohle identified the clothing project as the fashion client that his team were looking for .
“ we went to the prison after hearing about the products and were very pleased by the quality .
it was then that we decided this would be a very interesting project to be involved in , ” bohle told deutsche welle . initiating a campaign aimed at hitting the trend seekers and setters of the capital ’ s hot spots and bar scene around berlin ’ s trendy mitte and prenzlauer berg neighborhoods , the agency played on the current market desire for unusual yet simple designs . unusual and simple “ people are always looking for fashion that ’ s out of the ordinary but simple , ” said bohle .
“ there are thousands of types of shoes out there but these shoes are hand-made and worn by prisoners … they ’ re special . ” bohle and his team applied market psychology to market the haeftling range in such a way as to snare the fashionistas : “ it ’ s about unusual labels ; it ’ s about telling a story , delivering an authentic message and conveying credibility . ”
by being up front about the origins of the clothing , bohle believes it will only be a matter of time before the haeftling -lrb- prisoner -rrb- line takes on a cult following .
indeed , the initial reception indicates that his instincts are spot on . european wide demand the haeftling internet shop went online july 11 , and since then bohle has been amazed at the response .
“ sales for the clothing have been incredible , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gone europe-wide .
we ’ re selling not just in germany , but britain , the netherlands , scandinavia and austria . ” the products themselves seem to live up to herr ledesi ’ s philosophy of transparency .
with solid and functional pin-striped shirts in prison-issue blue - which come complete with an identification tag - robust boots and heavy jackets more suited for cold mornings in the exercise yard , the haeftling range makes no secret of where it comes from and who made it . project helps prisoners in the tegel prison , about 40 percent of the 1,700 prisoners do n't do any work within the system , meaning that they have access to little money other than the € 26 monthly allowance given to them by the government . but those working on the clothing line can earn an extra € 7.50 to € 12.50 a day .
prison authorities hope that the success of the project can help inmates find work within the facility and , once they are released , in the outside world .
it is also seen as a motivational tool which boosts self confidence and esteem . whatever your views on wearing fashions created by the incarcerated , one thing is certain : once haeftling products are seen draped over a celebrity at a premiere or glittering party , wearing clothes made by people from the penal system will become so last year , darling . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art breaks through prison walls an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special .

critics said the loss of tax revenues in 2004 would create a budget gap of at least € 7 billion and further burden the already slumping german economy . but schröder and eichel said encouraging consumer spending was more important to them right now than future budget holes .
to make up for the gap , the government will borrow between € 4 and € 5 billion , privatize and cut subsidies for farmers and builders .
opposition politicians immediately responded to eichel and schröder 's announcement wednesday afternoon by saying they hoped for more subsidy cuts and less borrowing .
the coalition government will introduce its finance plans to parliament on aug .

around 1,200 jobs will be slashed in the next three years , the company said .
a spokesman said the figure was assuming " the worst-case scenario " and might not be reached . but the announcement was the latest in a series of blows the industry has dealt the company .
at the beginning of 2003 , thomas cook posted a € 119.5 million -lrb- $ 133.99 million -rrb- loss for the 2001-2002 fiscal year .

dz is expected to benefit from norisbank 's consumer finance products know-how .
the dz will overtake norisbank at the end of september . more germans banking online more germans are heading online for their banking needs according to new figures from the german association of banks .
there were 30 million bank accounts managed in 2002 , indicating that an increasing number of germans are preferring the tap of keys and click of the mouse to standing in lines at local branches .

a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift . german chancellor schröder may have cancelled his vacation to the sunny adriatic coast in a huff , but he could still head to the west german mining town of bochum for a touch of mediterranean flair .
maybe even some reassurance that the current row with his italian neighbors may be just a minor blip in otherwise robust relations .
with uncanny timing an exhibition has opened at the zeche hanover museum in bochum documenting a rather different italian german story than the stormy one being played out on the political stage with discussions reduced to spaghetti and sauerkraut .
under the rather unwieldy name " naples-bochum-rimini : working in germany – vacationing in italy , " the show takes a personal trip back to the 1950s when germany signed a recruitment treaty in 1955 with italy that resulted in two simultaneous migratory waves that could hardly have been more different : while italian " guestworkers " came in droves to germany seeking work in the industrial ruhr region , the postwar german economic miracle had the first vacationers packing their bags and heading to italy 's sunny beaches .
warm socks and a vespa for germany with over 350 exhibits , the show documents the daily routine of italians working in the mines , railway works and construction sites in the ruhr region in the 1950s and presents kitschy holiday souvenirs from the first german vacations in italy .
museum spokesman markus fischer told deutsche welle that a large part of the exhibits stem from private collections .
" we approached several italians as well as germans who still live in the area and they generously gave us personal items from that time such as razors and even a pair of socks lovingly knitted by an italian mama for her son to keep him warm in the cold ruhr region . "

critics said the loss of tax revenues in 2004 would create a budget gap of at least € 7 billion and further burden the already slumping german economy . but schröder and eichel said encouraging consumer spending was more important to them right now than future budget holes .
to make up for the gap , the government will borrow between € 4 and € 5 billion , privatize and cut subsidies for farmers and builders .
opposition politicians immediately responded to eichel and schröder 's announcement wednesday afternoon by saying they hoped for more subsidy cuts and less borrowing .
the coalition government will introduce its finance plans to parliament on aug .

political observers are certain that the plans will not pass in their present form . thomas cook slumping , announces job cuts battered by the slumping tourism industry , german tourism giant thomas cook announced wednesday it was stepping up its savings course with job cuts .
after posting their first-ever losses and announcing that bookings were down earlier in the year , thomas cook said it would cut one in every five jobs in germany .
around 1,200 jobs will be slashed in the next three years , the company said .
a spokesman said the figure was assuming " the worst-case scenario " and might not be reached . but the announcement was the latest in a series of blows the industry has dealt the company .
at the beginning of 2003 , thomas cook posted a € 119.5 million -lrb- $ 133.99 million -rrb- loss for the 2001-2002 fiscal year .
as part of a savings course , the company cut 500 jobs . hypovereinsbank sells daughter bank hypovereinsbank , germany 's second largest bank , completed the sale of its daughter bank to frankfurt-based dz bank , hvb announced on wednesday .
the munich bank sold norisbank to dz for 447 million euros , earning a capital gain of € 250 million for itself . hvb said the sale is a move forward towards its goal to drive its tier 1 capital ratio from 5.7 percent to 7 percent by the end of the year .
dz is expected to benefit from norisbank 's consumer finance products know-how .
the dz will overtake norisbank at the end of september . more germans banking online more germans are heading online for their banking needs according to new figures from the german association of banks .
there were 30 million bank accounts managed in 2002 , indicating that an increasing number of germans are preferring the tap of keys and click of the mouse to standing in lines at local branches .
the figure is a 50 percent increase over amounts in 2001 and keeps to a growing trend that first began in 1998 .

stuck for a new look this summer ?
many people wanting to revamp their wardrobe are turning to fashions created , worn and sold by inmates at the tegel prison in berlin . the fashion world is a fickle one .
no one with any sense of what ’ s hot and what ’ s not would be seen dead in anything other than the latest collections .
in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .

stuck for a new look this summer ?
many people wanting to revamp their wardrobe are turning to fashions created , worn and sold by inmates at the tegel prison in berlin . the fashion world is a fickle one .
no one with any sense of what ’ s hot and what ’ s not would be seen dead in anything other than the latest collections .
in an industry where black is the new brown , which was in turn last year ’ s green , and where the label means more than the common sense and practicality of the ensemble , a new trend is hitting the streets of berlin and spreading fast .
this summer , those trend-conscious europeans can be inspired by a new look : prison chic . don ’ t be fooled .
anyone taking to the streets in suits emblazoned with arrows , manacles or death row orange overalls will be making a fashion faux pas of disastrous proportions .
subtlety and authenticity are the key here .
the range that ’ s rapidly becoming the latest in cult clothing comes not from the boutiques of paris but from the very workshops of the tegel prison in berlin . ad agency promotes prison wear sold via the internet under the label “ haeftling – jailwear since 1898 , ” the full penitentiary collection includes shirts , shoes , bags and jackets - all made by prisoners at tegel .
the concept is being championed by berlin advertising agency herr ledesi , which has been promoting the range of clothing through a poster campaign on billboards and in magazines . after hearing about the products the prisoners were making for their own use , agency chief stephan bohle identified the clothing project as the fashion client that his team were looking for .

the service , called piertopier , is being offered free to anyone who has the right gear and relies on volunteers and donations to keep it alive .
" we all live in brighton and we want to work on the beach , " explained alex studd of internet provider moving edge which is backing the project .
the organisers have been talking about taking the web to the beach for some time .
but it was only some five months ago when they started work on making this into a reality .
free as air the network went into beta testing at the beginning of july and the backers say they expect to have a full service available within a month .
the cost of internet connectivity is becoming cheaper by the month so we do n't anticipate any problems alex studd , moving edge there is growing interest in wireless technology , called wi-fi , which allows people to connect to the internet at broadband speeds without the need to plug in any cables .
currently there are about 1,000 so-called public hotspots available throughout europe in places such as airports , cafes and hotel lobbies .
in most cases , these charge for a connection .
by contrast , the idea behind piertopier is to make the net as free as the air .
it is backed by various internet access and software companies in the brighton area .
these sponsors have paid for the computer hardware and have donated the internet bandwidth , while volunteers provide the necessary support .
all in all , the cost of setting up wi-fi on brighton beach has been less than £ 1,000 .
" we like to be cost-effective as we can do more , " explained mr studd .
" in a place like brighton where there is high connectivity , we can write off the cost . "
" and the costs are only ever going to go down .
the cost of internet connectivity is becoming cheaper by the month so we do n't anticipate any problems in the foreseeable future . "
salt , sand and water it could be that the best day to go to the beach to use the internet is a cloudy day ian fogg , jupiter research the organisers of the piertopier project see it as the hi-tech equivalent of community radio .
they are part of a community which aims to allow people to go online from anywhere without having to pay costly bills .
the idea of working from the beach has it attractions , but it can also have its dangers , warn experts .
" if you like the net and you like the beach , this is a great combination , " said ian fogg , wi-fi analyst at jupiter research .
" the real problem - apart from the salt , apart from the sand , apart from the water - is that the screens on many of these pdas and laptops do n't work that well in sunlight .
" it could be that the best day to go to the beach to use the internet is a cloudy day . "

the firm said demand for memory chips , mobile handsets and flat screens - all key products for samsung - was slack , leading to heavy price-cuts .

cautious optimism samsung said that the sars virus had knocked a dent in this quarter 's results .
mobile phone sales fell 7.7 % short of target , for example .
but it insisted it would catch up in the rest of the year , principally by launching a range of new products in the second half .
samsung also predicted a rebound in long-sluggish computer chip prices .

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- said the electronic spying agency vastly underestimated the cost of transferring its sophisticated computer equipment to its new base , dubbed " the doughnut " because of its ring-shaped design .
it added that if ministers had known the final cost - more than seven times the original estimate - they may never have approved the project .
originally gchq had calculated the cost of the move from its existing home in more than 50 small buildings across two sites in cheltenham to an all-in-one site in the town at £ 41m over two years .
this would have involved shutting down each computer system and restarting them in the new building .
the original estimate of £ 40m for the cost of moving their computer systems all in one go may be the most inaccurate i have ever seen edward leigh commons public accounts committee but during work to prepare computers for the so-called " millennium bug " , analysts found the various systems were more linked in a more complex way than previously thought .
as a result , they concluded that a simple " box move " would leave gchq virtually unable to produce vital signals intelligence for two years .
completing the transfer within the original time-frame without " unacceptable damage " to the flow of intelligence would cost £ 450m .
revised plans for a move over five years were then drawn up , at a cost of £ 308m .
' poor management ' but this meant keeping some of gchq 's old buildings open until 2012 , at a further cost of £ 43m .

" their moment in history has ended ...
they are undesirable for the country , and the moment for their demobilisation has come , " said chief government negotiator luis carlos restrepo .

paramilitaries , the farc and the eln are all active in the region .
a car bomb killed a policeman during president uribe 's last visit to the city of arauca in october .
the government is due to be based there for the next three days .
ahead of the president 's arrival troops combed the city , searching for weapons and explosives .

but they are an important way of telling which hospitals are doing well - and which need to buck up their ideas .
basically the best hospital trusts get three stars - the worst none .
most of course are somewhere in between .
portsmouth nhs trust has rocketed from no star to two stars in hampshire , southampton and north hampshire were three-star trusts , and the isle of wight a no star .
but the big success story was portsmouth , which had laboured for two years without a single star and has now rocketed up to two-star status , mainly by hitting all its important targets on waiting lists .
this is where things get difficult .
every trust which runs an acute hospital is given nine key targets to achieve over the year - these are things like reducing the waiting list for operations from 15 months to 12 months .
making sure patients in accident and emergency are seen within 12 hours is another , as is making sure that the financial accounts are balanced at the end of the year .
usually , those hospitals which fail to get a star fall down on one or more of these areas .
that does not mean they do not do good work in other areas but this is what the government considers important , and this is what they are judged by .
big brother for a no star trust , the consequences can be fairly dramatic .
they do not lose any money , but they do get a very beady eye cast over them for the next year by the department of health .
that may sound innocuous but actually it can be quite an experience for managers and staff - who can feel they are working under the eye of big brother .
one chief executive i spoke to said that he could not even send out a press release without having it approved in advance - such are the penalties of failure .
but more importantly it can seriously hamper a hospital 's attempts to recruit new staff .
not whole picture if you were a doctor , nurse or medical professional looking to move to the south coast - which hospitals would you think of applying to first ?
probably not the no star trust .
insiders say these league tables and star charts are useful , as far as they go , but there is a whiff of lies , damned lies and statistics about them .
in other words , they do not tell the whole picture .
sometimes trusts can lose out on a star simply by amassing a few too many cancelled operations , and , as is always the case with these things , the media look to the worst and to the best and label hospitals successes or failures when the bigger picture is actually much more complicated .

figures from local authorities show that 246 teachers are being made redundant , taking voluntary redundancy or have accepted early retirement packages .
but just 33 of those posts are being replaced - meaning there will be 213 fewer teachers in welsh schools .
a bbc investigation has discovered that , across the 22 councils of wales , there will be 62 compulsory redundancies , 57 voluntary redundancies and 127 early retirements .
the majority of the 246 staff will go at the end of the summer term , while the rest are expected to leave by christmas .
i was angry and it hit me hard redundant teacher anna nicholas one of the reasons for the cuts has been identified as the falling birthrate in wales .
about 75 % of school funding is determined by the number of children attending schools , and a reduction in pupils brings a cut in the number of teachers .
nearly 45,000 children were born in wales in 1961 - that had dropped to below 36,000 by 1981 , and to below 31,000 in the latest census in 2001 .
teacher anna nicholas , 26 , lost her job at ysgol gyfun glantaf in may after her first year as a full-time teacher .
the school cited a lack of funding as the reason for making her redundant .
ms nichols said : " i 'd been working there for seven months when we first started hearing about the possibility of redundancies .
" soon afterwards , in may , i was told by letter .
unions fear more cuts will be made " i was devastated because i had to find a new job and i was fairly desperate to find a job by september .
" the reason given was that the school 's funds were not enough to cover teachers ' pay .
" i was angry and it hit me hard for a couple of weeks . "
teaching unions are dismayed by the cuts in teacher numbers .
officials have said schools in wales are being under funded by £ 40m , although the welsh assembly has increased funding to local authorities .
' larger class sizes ' karl davies , director of naht cymru , said : " so much -lrb- money -rrb- has been swallowed up by inflation in the system .
" teachers ' pay has gone up , as have pensions contributions .
" it means there are going to be larger class sizes . "
tim cox nasuwt representative for south east wales , added : " fifteen years ago , there would n't have been compulsory redundancies in this situation , it 's the compulsories i 'm concerned about . "
claims that schools are under funded have been strongly denied by the welsh assembly government .
education minister jane davidson said that budgets at schools were on the increase .
she said that average funding per pupil in 2003/4 would be £ 3,499 - an increase of 10 % on last year 's figure of £ 3,167 .
she also announced that school budget forums will be created in each local authority , and would be set up in time to consider next year 's budgets .
" i believe the forums will lead to better informed debate about the needs of schools leading up to the annual decisions about local authority budgets , " she said .
